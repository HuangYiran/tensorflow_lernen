1
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,546
它安全么?
Is it safe?

2
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,675
是的, 密室已经被封上了
其他人呢?
Yes. The chamber has been sealed.
Where are the others?

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,262
兄弟会现在有的只是陷落的Astrenon
只剩下我们了
The Brotherhood has fallen Astrenon.
We are all that remains

4
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:40,265
天哪
如果我们死了, 那就....
My God.
If we die, then....

5
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,768
快点!
它们越来越近了!
Hurry!
They're getting closer!

6
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,625
Eleena, 我知道我已经说过了,
不过还是非常感谢你
Eleena, I know I've said this before,
but thank you so much

7
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,003
允许我们留在这里
还帮我们拿来这些材料
for letting us in here,
helping us through the material.

8
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:12,088
它们实在是太吸引人了
It's been utterly fascinating.

9
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:17,385
我非常乐意这样做, 博士
非常抱歉这些信息非常凌乱
I'm happy to do it Doctor.
I'm sorry this information is so scattered.

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,556
我担心我们同时涉及的项目太多
I'm afraid we were working on
so many projects at once,

11
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,184
以至于会经常拿错相关的材料
that reference materials
tend to get misplaced.

12
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,270
看这
Look at that.

13
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:38,281
发生什么事了?
What is going on here?

14
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,116
只是开一些小玩笑, McKay
Just having a little fun, McKay.

15
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:41,618
我们现在能够
重新投入到工作中去么?
Can we get back to work now?

16
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:45,371
我只是不明白翻看这些历史书
对找到ZPM有什么帮助
I just don't see how running through history
books is gonna find us our ZPM.

17
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,457
好吧
Really.

18
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:51,294
看到这了么? 这是一张拓片
取自一个古人的修道院
See this? This is a charcoal rubbing,
taken from an Ancient temple,

19
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,755
它大致建成于Weir列出清单的时候
(这里的Weir指15集中返回过去的Weir)
built about the time Weir's list was written.

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,215
注意到什么东西比较眼熟了么, 嗯?
Notice anything familiar, hmmm?

21
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,135
这是一个ZPM
瞧, 我们已经很接近了
It's a ZPM.
Look we are close.

22
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:01,137
比我们以前任何时候都要接近
Closer than we have ever been before.

23
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:03,765
现在这个星系当中
Now there might very well be hundreds
of Zero Point Modules,

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,724
可能藏着数百个ZPM
hidden in this galaxy,

25
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:07,101
不过我们唯一可以间接确认的那个
就在这里!
but the only one we are remotely
sure of, is here!

26
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:10,688
这里!
如果你们还想回家
Here!
Now if you ever want to go home.

27
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:18,696
如果你们还想保卫亚特兰蒂斯
免受幽灵的侵害, 我们就需要找到它
If you ever want to protect Atlantis
from the Wraith, we need to find this.

28
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:20,574
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第16集 兄弟会
Charlie_CZ

29
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:29,308
他们知不知道那个ZPM
可能在什么地方?
Do they have any information
on where the ZPM could be?

30
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,937
根据传说中所讲述的, 有一个古人
穿过星际之门从亚特兰蒂斯来到那里
According to legend, an Ancient from
Atlantis came through the Stargate

31
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:36,107
并将一件稀有的财宝托付给了
一伙Sudarian的祭司
and entrusted a sect of Sudarian
priests with a rare treasure,

32
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:37,775
或者说是potentia
他们是这样叫那东西的
or potentia, as they called it.

33
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,362
那个Lantian人叫他们藏好那个东西
无论如何又不能让幽灵夺去
This Lantian told them to keep it hidden
from the Wraith at all costs.

34
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,283
现在Sudarian人非常崇敬古人
并且把potentia视为
Now the Sudarian people worshipped
the Ancients and considered the potentia,

35
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,701
他们最神圣的物品
their most sacred artifact.

36
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,746
现在可以说他们是完完全全按照
古人的吩咐去做了
Now predictably they did exactly
as the Ancient requested.

37
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,247
那个potentia是....
The potentia being....

38
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:53,291
ZPM
The ZPM

39
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,792
这么说他们从来没有用过它?
So they wouldn't have used it?

40
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:57,086
据我所知, 他们只在非常重要的节日
From what I could tell,
they only brought it out of hiding,

41
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:58,463
才把它从保藏的地点取出来展示
to be displayed on high holidays.

42
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,298
如果他们知道它可以被利用
那我就觉得奇怪了
I'd be surprised if the knew
it could be used,

43
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,257
不过这是一个好消息
and that is good news.

44
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:04,385
如果他们不知道如何利用它
那么很有可能它还是满的
If they didn't know how to use it,
chances are it's still could be full.

45
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,472
不过坏消息是
在经过幽灵上万年的掠夺之后
The bad news however, is that after
10,000 years of Wraith culling,

46
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,348
Sudarian人的文明在本质上已经灭绝了
Sudarian society is essentially extinct.

47
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,685
星球上现有的文明
都是后来重新发展起来的
The planet's inhabitants are only
at a renaissance level of development,

48
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,522
不过在我们的一些帮助下
我想他们还是可以取得一些进展的
but with the help of some of our gear,
I really think they could make some headway.

49
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:21,444
好吧, 我信了
少校, 带你的人再去一次Dagan
Alright. I'm sold.
Major, take your team back to Dagan.

50
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,614
看看你们能不能
为我们搞到一张回家的票
See if you can get us a ticket home.

51
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,260
伤处还在疼么?
Does it still pain you?

52
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,015
你们走吧
Leave us.

53
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:58,689
你有什么要跟我说的?
What do you have for me?

54
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,400
Atlantians人回到了Dagan
The Atlantians have returned to Dagan.

55
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:02,235
你确信?
You're sure?

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,946
噢, 是的
我们的线人刚刚报告的
Oh yes.
Our operative just checked in.

57
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:10,159
这距他们离开那里只有12小时
他们一定离它已经很近了
It's only been 12 hours since they left.
They must be getting close to it.

58
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,620
我们知不知道那到底是什么?
Do we have any idea what it is yet?

59
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,247
我们了解得稍微多一点
We know a little more.

60
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:20,253
很多眼线一直以来都在远处盯着
那些亚特兰蒂斯队伍
Many offworld spies have been keeping
a close eye on the Atlantian teams, from afar.

61
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:24,924
这是我们好不容易才得到的第一个
跟他们如此接近的星球
This is the first planet we've managed
to get this close to them.

62
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,344
他们在寻找一个
Lantian时代的能源
They're looking for a Lantian
era power source.

63
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,388
Cowens首领在那个队伍中么?
Is Chief Cowens on the team?

64
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:35,184
现在不在 他要先完成别的任务
即使他在队伍中
Not yet. His priorities are elsewhere.
Even if he was.

65
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:37,353
他也不会发给你消息的
He would never send you.

66
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,025
亚特兰蒂斯人最需要的是
更多的能量
The last thing the Atlantians
need is more power.

67
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,779
让我去那个星球
不管Cowens愿不愿意
Get me on that planet.
With or without Cowens blessing.

68
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,031
我不知道发生了什么
它就是不工作了
I don't know how it happened,
it just stopped working.

69
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:52,451
我恢复了其中一些功能
不过仍然有一些功能还没有恢复
I got some of the functionality back,
it still isn't doing everything it used to.

70
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:55,788
好吧, 如果不再有人在这个
有一万年历史的设备附近
Yes well, maybe if people stopped insisting in such close proximity to 10, 000 year
on having food and liquid old equipment.

71
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:02,753
嗨! 我们已经很小心了
不是我们导致的这个问题
Hey! We're very careful.
We're not the problem here.

72
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,839
是的 啊 哈
Yes. Ah ha.

73
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:15,725
你碰了什么?
What did you touch?

74
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,728
没有, 我什么也没有碰
Nothing. I didn't touch anything.

75
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,984
重新校对一下
Revise it.

76
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:33,487
这是什么??
What is this??

77
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:34,911
我不知道我们有深空探测器
I didn't know we had deep space sensors.

78
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:35,953
是的 没人知道
Yes, well, no-one did.

79
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:39,165
据我所知, 它们同其它主要系统一起
From what I can tell, they've been running
silently in the background,

80
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,917
默默的在后台运行
along with our other primary systems.

81
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:41,959
在后台?
In the background?

82
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:42,919
是的
Yes

83
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:44,795
那么为什么又突然跳到了前台?
So why this sudden leap to the foreground?

84
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,881
问得很好
Excellent question.

85
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,675
我们还不知道答案, 是不是?
We don't have an answer for that yet, do we?

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,801
到现在为止, 还不知道
Not as of yet, no.

87
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,511
好了, 说出来让我参考参考
不要把我当外人
Ok, well keep me in the loop.

88
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,597
噢, 没有把你当外人
Oh. You are the loop.

89
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,142
那么现在是不是可以说
Now isn't that a nice thing to say.

90
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,189
我还是很欢迎你继续与我同行
You're more than welcome
to continue walking with me,

91
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,941
不过你是不是还有一些事情需要去做?
but if there's something you need to do?

92
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:07,026
是的 是的
Yes. Yes.

93
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,489
他们称自己为Quidosen
They call themselves the Quidosen.

94
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,241
一个由15个修道士所组成的兄弟会
A brotherhood of 15 monks,

95
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,203
他们唯一的使命就是
保护Potentia, 或者说是 ZPM的安全
whose sole occupation
was to keep the Potentia, or ZPM safe.

96
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,621
这很吸引人
That's fascinating.

97
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,706
是的, 很吸引人
Yes, fascinating.

98
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,584
请继续
Please go on.

99
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,712
这15个人所组成的兄弟会
是由一个首领
The brotherhood of the 15,
consisted of a master handler,

100
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,631
5个保卫者以及9个石头携带者所组成
5 protectors and 9 stone carriers.

101
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:31,384
他们最害怕的就是
整个兄弟会
Their greatest fear was that
the entire brotherhood

102
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,511
在某一天会被幽灵抓去
might one day be culled by the Wraith,

103
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,430
这样就永远不会有人找到那个ZPM
which would result in the ZPM
going missing forever.

104
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:40,309
没人可以找到, 是的, 不过它也不会
落入到敌人的手中
Missing yes, but it would not fall
into enemy hands.

105
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:42,186
他们被委托来保管那个ZPM
They were entrusted with the ZPM.

106
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:45,773
他们所希望的就是就是有一天
Lantians将会回来收回它
Their hope was that one day
the Lantians would return to reclaim

107
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,193
并且作为完成任务的报答
付给Sudarian人民一些奖赏
it and reward the Sudarian people
for completing their task.

108
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:52,321
于是他们留下暗示 线索
即使兄弟会被消灭...
So they left hints, clues,
should the brotherhood be destroyed.

109
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:53,406
是这样
That's right.

110
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:57,785
祭司们制作了9个带有标记的石头
把它们放在一起时
The priests created 9 stone markers,
that when united,

111
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,497
就会揭示最后
are supposed to reveal
the final resting place

112
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:04,500
Quidosen保藏宝物的地方
of the Quidosan's protected treasure.

113
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,003
到目前为止我们只找到了三个
So far we've only found three.

114
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:10,715
这些石头上刻有很多点和线
The etching on the rocks,
involve many lines and dots.

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,174
我们认为这是一张地图
We think it's a map.

116
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,592
嗯, 令人惊奇
Hmmm. Amazing.

117
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:14,510
确实是
It is actually.

118
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:17,054
这看起来好像是古人的编号系统
This looks like an Ancient
numbering system.

119
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,556
我们也是这样想的
That's what we thought.

120
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:21,475
据我们所知
应该是数字3, 6和7
From what we can tell,
the numbers 3, 6 and 7.

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,936
干得漂亮
Excellent work.
I mean, seriously,

122
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,730
认真地说, 我已经被深深地打动了
I'm very impressed here.

123
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,107
你实在是太友好了, 博士
That's very kind of you Doctor.

124
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,567
你们是在哪里找到它们的?
Where did you find them?

125
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,153
这个建筑过去实际上是
他们的修道院
This building used to be their
monastery, actually.

126
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,031
我们把在这里找到的一些信息
凑合在一起
We pieced together some of the
information we found here ,

127
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,241
然后依此找到了6号和7号石头
and tracked down the number
6 and 7 stones.

128
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,660
另外我们在一次不相关的挖掘中
找到了3号石头
We found the number 3 stone
on an unrelated dig,

129
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,494
就是在上周
just last week.

130
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,039
就是说如果我们找到了石头
我们就找到了地图
So if we find the stones, we find the map.

131
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:45,124
是的, 很对
Yes, exactly.

132
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,253
你看到这个了么?
You see this?

133
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,838
设计中的一部分?
Part of the design?

134
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,426
我并不认为石头上有些部分的存在
仅仅是为了美观
I don't think anything on these stones
is there for just aesthetics.

135
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,555
每块石头在不同的位置
都有一块凹陷的区域
Yeah. Each of the stones has a different
part of the grid embossed.

136
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,892
表示在最后组合的时候
各自所处的位置
Signifying where it's correct placing should
be in the final configuration.

137
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,518
很对
Exactly.

138
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,686
然后呢?
So what?

139
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,606
然后? 噢! 你有地图么?
So what? Oy! Do you have a map?

140
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:15,112
你们是在哪里找到它们的?
Ok, where did you find them?

141
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:17,823
我们在这里找到七号石头
We found the seventh
stone here.

142
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:22,119
在这里找到六号
以及最近...
The sixth stone here,
and most recently we stumbled

143
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:24,538
在这里找到了三号石头
on the number 3 stone, here.

144
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:28,292
你们可能不知道找到它是多么的幸运
You have no idea how lucky a find that was.

145
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:31,587
我明白了
I see it

146
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:32,963
博士, 我不太明白....
Doctor, I'm not sure....

147
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:33,839
他们是根据一个网格来埋藏的
They buried a grid.

148
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,675
瞧, 如果没有三号石头
我们就无法完成这些
Look, we couldn't have done this
without the number three stone.

149
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:40,221
它, 与七号石头一起
为我们指出了两个相对的角
That, along with the number seven stone,
give us two diagonally opposed corners.

150
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,848
根据这个, 我们就可以精确推断
网格到底有多大
From that, you can extrapolate
exactly how big the grid is,

151
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,684
从而推断出其它石头埋藏的地点
and therefore, where each of the other
stones should be buried.

152
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,272
好吧, 分成两队
让我们开始挖吧
Alright, split up Two teams.
Let's start digging.

153
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:52,942
你认为他们会找到它么?
Do you think they will find it:?

154
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:57,780
曾经有很多人从多个不同的星球赶来
寻找Quidosa失落的财宝
Many people from may world's have come
to find the lost city of Quidosa.

155
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:59,949
你认为他们会找到么?
Do you think they will find it?

156
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,034
我不知道
I do not know.

157
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:06,122
我们将会等待他们找到那个财宝
然后我们就用武力把它夺走
We'll wait for them to find the treasure,
then we'll take it by force.

158
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,833
除非我下命令, 你的人不能随便行动
明白么?
Your men are not to act
until I give the word, understood?

159
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,918
当然
Absolutely.

160
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,172
我们应该往...嗯...右, 我想
Which would make us, uh, right, I think.

161
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,386
你能够相信我们所取得进展么, Simear
Can you believe the progress
we've made, Simear.

162
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:24,682
我们为了找这些石头
已经花了多少年了?
How many years have we been
searching for these stones?

163
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,725
怎么了?
What's wrong?

164
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,894
我们不应该帮助他们, Eleena
We should not be helping them, Eleena.

165
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,814
我们在帮他们的时候
他们也在帮助我们
They're helping us as much
as we are helping them.

166
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:36,318
如果找到了potentia, 他们就会带走它
你必须意识到这一点
They will take the potentia if they find it.
You must see that.

167
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:40,448
他们是从伟大的城市
亚特兰蒂斯  过来的
They have come to us,
from the great city of Atlantis.

168
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,034
那个15人组成的兄弟会正是为他们
It is for them,
that the brotherhood of the 15,

169
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,412
而保藏那个财宝的
have kept the treasure hidden.

170
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,831
我不相信他们, Eleena
I do not trust them Eleena.

171
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:55,087
如果你想回到你的村子
而不是帮助我们
If you would rather head back
to your village, than help us.

172
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,173
我不会拦你的
I will not stop you.

173
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,207
过来一下
Just a second.

174
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,604
Eleena!
Eleena!

175
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,787
这会生效的
This is gonna work.

176
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,206
我想会的
I think it just might.

177
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,761
这是Suderian 村庄的布局图
It's a layout of the
Suderian villages.

178
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:30,849
这座修道院的墙壁
为她守护了一万年
The walls of this monastery have protected
her for 10,000 years.

179
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,935
它很漂亮
It's beautiful.

180
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,730
确实是
不过现在我的眼睛正开着其它地方
It is. And yet my eye is drawn elsewhere.

181
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:47,992
我希望有一天能够修复它
不过我怕把它弄坏了
I'd like to restore it one day,
but I'm afraid of damaging it.

182
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,995
也许你可以帮助我, 博士
Perhaps you could help me, Doctor.

183
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,915
实际上, 你应该开始叫我Rodney了
Really, you need to start calling me Rodney.

184
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,085
好的
Very well.

185
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:04,758
我没有让你觉得厌烦吧?
I don't bore you, do I?

186
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:09,930
不, 不是因为你
我想我从没有这么困过
No, it's not you.
I don't think I've ever been so tired.

187
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:13,225
你是一个科学家
到现在你还没有习惯么?
You're a scientist.
Are you not used to this by now?

188
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,437
我的那种科学是一种很好的科学
My kind of science is the good
kind of science.

189
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,983
就是那种你可以坐在椅子上
甚至是躺在沙发上
The kind you can do sitting on a chair,
or even laying on a couch.

190
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:26,739
在古人的城市中生活
是种什么滋味, Rodney?
What was it like growing up in the city
of the ancestors, Rodney?

191
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,616
抱歉?
Sorry?

192
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,409
亚特兰蒂斯
Atlantis.

193
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:31,577
噢, 不, 不, 不
Oh, no, no, no.

194
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:36,790
我们是来自于另外一个星系中
被称作为地球的行星
We come from a planet called Earth
in an altogether different galaxy.

195
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:40,210
我们只是最近才把
亚特兰蒂斯当作我们的家
We only just recently made
Atlantis our home.

196
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,378
多久以前?
How recently?

197
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,714
实际上只有几个月
A matter of months really.

198
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:49,261
嗯, 你困了
睡吧, 我就不打扰你了
Mmmm. You're tired.
Do not let me keep you from sleep.

199
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:54,058
如果你坚持, 我会, 嗯...好吧
If you insist, I'll, uh..ok

200
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:07,946
我要上床睡觉了
I'm heading to bed.

201
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,115
哪个床?
Which bed might that be.

202
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:13,577
什么?
What?

203
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:17,456
我想Eleena或许是
有点爱上你了
I think Eleena might have
a little crush on you Doctor.

204
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:18,874
是么?
She does?

205
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,834
我们都看得很清楚
It is very clear to us all.

206
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,877
是么?
It is?

207
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,712
非常清楚, 除了你, 显然
Well everyone but you, apparently.

208
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:26,340
我应该...你确信么?
Well, should I...Are you sure about this?

209
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,758
是的, 非常确信
Yeah, pretty sure.

210
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,635
我应该怎么做?
What should I do?

211
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,345
你不知道怎么做?
You don't know what to do?

212
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,180
我知道最后应该怎么做
I know what to do eventually.

213
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,392
我的意思是, 我应该说些什么
说些什么, 就在今晚
I mean, should I say something.
Something tonight.

214
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,977
告诉你是什么, Valentino
(意大利裔的美国演员,
以扮演浪漫的主角而出名)
Tell you what, Valentino.
Wait till tomorrow.

215
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,022
等到明天, 在你获得一些休息之后
你会更加投入到你的游戏中去的
You'll be more on your game,
after you get some rest.

216
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,526
好吧, 好吧, 很好的答案
晚安
Right. Right. Good answer. Goodnight.

217
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,504
这看起来不像是一幅地图
我想我以前认为的不对
It doesn't look much like a map.
I guess I was wrong.

218
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,548
嗯, 有可能
尽管, 嗯
Hmmm. Possibly.
Although, um.

219
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,969
仅仅因为最开始你认为
它是一幅地图
Well, you know, just because
you originally thought it was a map,

220
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:15,723
并不就能说你最初的假设
不好或者不对
doesn't make your initial assumption
bad or incorrect.

221
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,892
不对, 是的, 不过这是一个很好的猜想
Well incorrect, yes, but it was a good guess.

222
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,978
对不起?
I'm sorry?

223
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:26,150
你非常非常聪明和有魅力
You are very, very smart and attractive
and whatknot,

224
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:32,823
有太多太多赞美你的话
即时是当....
and you've got a lot of things going for you,
even when things don't....

225
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:36,618
一切都好吧?
Is everything alright?

226
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:38,620
是的, 一切都好
很好
Yes, everything's great.
It's great.

227
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,081
一切都很好
为什么会不好呢?
Everything's quite well,
why wouldn't it be?

228
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,416
你确信我们是在正确的地方?
You sure we're in
the right place?

229
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,419
我们已经将挖掘的区域扩大了一倍
不过我们仍然没有找到任何东西
We've almost doubled the size of the digsite
and we haven't found anything yet.

230
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,795
这应该是正确的地点
It's got to be the right place.

231
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,715
其它八块石头都正好在我们
预见的地方出现
The other eight stones were exactly
where we thought they would be.

232
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,175
这一个为什么要有不同呢?
Why would this be any different?

233
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,260
少校!
Major!

234
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,846
告诉我你找到了一块石头
Tell me you found a stone.

235
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:01,685
不全是, 长官, 不过我想McKay
应该来看看这个
Not quite sir, but I think McKay
should take a look at this.

236
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:09,860
这上面是兄弟会的标志
It carries the sign of the brotherhood.

237
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:13,530
我想是古人的语言
你知道是什么意思么?
I think it's in Ancient. Can you read it?

238
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,995
是警告
It is warning.

239
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:23,749
只有兄弟会中的15个人
才允许进入这个密室
It is only brotherhood the 15th
bidden chamber.

240
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,834
Quidosen的成员
Of that windows.

241
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,128
什么密室?
What chamber?

242
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:14,675
谁想第一个下?
看起来, 好像是, Sheppard?
So, who wants to go first.
Seems, sorta like, Sheppard might?

243
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,405
我们意料不到比这更好的了
We couldn't have planned it any better.

244
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,040
噢! 慢一点, Ford
Oh! Easy Ford"""

245
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:56,425
好了, 他下来了
Alright, he's down.

246
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,760
好了, 我留在这里
看住不让其它东西下来
Alright, I'll stay here,
keep an eye on the Descender.

247
00:17:58,886 --> 00:17:59,761
警惕点
Stay sharp.

248
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:04,266
如果有什么有趣的东西
我会让你知道的
I'll let you know if anything
interesting happens.

249
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:28,916
看到这了么? 这就是完整的图案
Do you see this? This is the whole pattern.

250
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:34,254
第九块石头必须与中间的
这个图案吻合
The ninth stone must integrate
into this Wraith centrepiece.

251
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:53,106
我想我们可以排除地图的想法了
I believe we can rule out a map.

252
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:55,192
好吧, 有什么想法?
Alright, any ideas?

253
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,611
我正在想
I'm getting there.

254
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,784
是的, 集合你的队伍
开往第七区
Yes, get your team together and
head off to section seven.

255
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,328
Weir博士,  Weir博士
我终于可以将我们的电脑接入到
Dr Weir. Dr Weir. I was finally
able to interface our computers

256
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:07,955
亚特兰蒂斯的远程探测器了
with the Atlantian long range sensors.

257
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,081
非常好
Excellent.

258
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,540
有身份不明的飞船
There's an unidentified craft,

259
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,210
大小近似于幽灵的小飞船
正朝我们的城市飞来
about the size of a Wraith dart,
heading for the city.

260
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,002
什么?
What?

261
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:14,878
是的
Yes.

262
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,463
抱歉
探测器数天以前就发现了它
Sorry.
The sensors picked it up day's ago,

263
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,547
只是我现在才弄清楚
but it's taken me until now,

264
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,508
它们正试图告诉我们的信息
to finally decipher what
they're trying to tell us.

265
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,593
小飞船 这怎么可能?
A dart. How is that possible?

266
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:24,179
也许它经过了改造
以便尽快赶到这里
Well, perhaps it was modified
to get here as quickly as possible.

267
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:26,014
母船仍然在数光年之外
The hive ships are light years away still.

268
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,393
它可能利用了邻近的星际之门
Well it could have used
neighbouring stargate

269
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,771
然后以最快速度飞向我们
and been flying towards
us at maximum speed,

270
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:36,400
自从幽灵探测到我们在这里以来
ever since Wraith discovered
that we were here.

271
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,570
按照它现有的速度
27分钟后它就会到达这里
At it's current velocity,
it'll be here in 27 minutes.

272
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:43,573
我们需要让我们的飞船升空
We need to get jumpers in the air.

273
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:08,640
什么, 你不相信什么?
What, what don't you believe?

274
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:11,351
这是星际之门的拨号地址
六个符号, 星际之门的地址
It's a gate address.
A six symbol, gate address.

275
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,437
星际之门的符号?
Gate symbols?

276
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,858
我看到了, 是的
I see them now. Yes.

277
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,444
你认出这个地址了么?
Do you recognise the address?

278
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,154
没有
No.

279
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,489
我对这些文字也不熟悉
I am not familiar with this world, either.

280
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,909
这就是说第九个石头
在另外一个星球上
So the ninth stone's on another planet.

281
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:32,789
他死了么?
Is he dead?

282
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:36,418
不, 只是昏迷了
他数小时内不会醒来
No, just unconscious.
He'll be like that for hours.

283
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:41,006
很好, 我们将等他们出现....
Excellent. We'll wait for them to appear....

284
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,228
把武器放下, Ford中尉
Put the weapon down, LT Ford.

285
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,238
Ford!
Ford!

286
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,662
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard.

287
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:17,334
我想中尉恐怕不得不
离开一会儿了
I'm afraid the Lt has had to
step away for a moment.

288
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,169
那是谁?
Who's that?

289
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,212
不可能
It can't be.

290
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:21,171
听起来好像是....
It sounds like....

291
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,256
Koya!!
Koya!!

292
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,469
很奇怪吧?
Surprised?

293
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:29,262
你还活着
You're alive.

294
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,806
到现在为止, 是这样
As far as I can tell.

295
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:35,727
你真的认为一颗打在肩膀上的子弹
就可以杀了我么?
Did you actually think a single bullet
to the shoulder would kill me?

296
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:38,939
我总是想你会更聪明一些
I always thought you were smarter than that.

297
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,108
你对Ford做了些什么?
What did you do to Ford?

298
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,111
他很好
He's fine.

299
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,821
那么, 你想要什么?
Then, what do you want?

300
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:50,867
同你一样, 少校
Quindosam失落的财宝
The same as you , Major.
The lost treaure of the Quindosam.

301
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,829
那对你有什么用?
What possible use could that be to you?

302
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:56,957
Daganian已经告诉我们
这个东西, ZPM,
The Daganians have informed
us that this ZPM,

303
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,335
不管怎样
是一个强大的能源
whatever it may be,
is an object of great power,

304
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,673
而强大的能源对所有人都有用
特别是Genii
and great power is of use to all people.
Especially the Genii.

305
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:06,758
Simear!
Simear!

306
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,387
他们给我们一个很大的回报
Eleena
They offered us a great reward,
Eleena,

307
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:15,183
他们同意让我们保存这个财宝
如果我们....
They agreed to let us keep the treasure,
if we....

308
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:19,062
它们对你没用Koya
ZPM只能在Atlantis工作
They're no use to you Koya.
ZPM's only work on Atlantis.

309
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:23,650
也许吧  不过我倾向于听到
这句话是由Genii的科学家说出的
Perhaps. But I prefer hearing
that from a Genii scientist.

310
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:27,028
我们还没有拥有它
我们还没有找到第九块石头
We do not have it yet.
We have not found the ninth stone.

311
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:30,198
我们现在具有
你们所无法想象的巨大的优势
We have an unbelievably large
tactical advantage over you.

312
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:32,659
现在如果我愿意的话
我可以封住密室上来的出口
Now if you would rather
I just cover the mouth

313
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,453
然后忘掉整件事情
of the chamber up and forget
about the whole thing,

314
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:37,539
我简直是太想这样做了
I'm more than willing to consider it.

315
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:40,834
她是对的 我们更接近
不过我们仍然没有得到
She's right. We're closer,
but we're not there yet.

316
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,420
第九块石头藏在
另外一个行星上
Look, the ninth stone
is hidden on another planet.

317
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:45,213
现在我们有的
只有星际之门的地址
All we have, is the gate address.

318
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:50,135
McKay博士 很高兴又听到
你那讨厌的声音
Dr McKay. So wonderful to hear
your grating voice again.

319
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,220
手臂怎么样了?
How's the arm?

320
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:01,188
你是想继续说讽刺的话
还是希望找到ZPM?
You wanna keep trading barbs?
Or you wanna find the ZPM?

321
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,608
把我拉上来
我会帮你找到它
Look, lift me out of here,
I'll help you find it,

322
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,651
不过你答应要让我的队员离开
but then you let my team go.

323
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,153
住嘴, McKay
Shut up, McKay.

324
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:09,988
你有更好的主意?
You got a better idea?

325
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:11,865
没有
No.

326
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,117
你同不同意?
Do we have a deal or not?

327
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:23,293
你和那两个Daganian人将被拉出来
同时还有每个人的武器和无线电
You and two Daganians will be raised out.
Along with everyone's weapons and radio's.

328
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:26,171
剩下的人留在那里
The rest of you will remain here.

329
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:30,842
如果McKay博士找到了ZPM
其他人就可以走了
If Dr McKay finds the ZPM,
the others will be let go.

330
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,928
我向你保证
I give you my word.

331
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:36,139
好吧, 我们接受他的承诺
Well, we have his word.

332
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:41,353
我想我们没有更多地选择了
我就要上来了!
I don't see that we have much choice.
I'm coming up!

333
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:50,570
我们已经将大部分人
封闭在住处了
We've got the general population
confined to quarters.

334
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,239
但愿他们不会受到伤害
Let's hope they're out of harms way.

335
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,615
Sheppard有没有回话?
Any word from Sheppard yet?

336
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,409
没有, 我没法联系到他
他的整个队伍都不在无线电旁
No, I haven't been able to reach him.
His entire team is off radio.

337
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,912
它仍然在以非常快的速度接近
It's still closing in very fast.

338
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,666
谁将去飞第三艘飞船?
Who are we going to get
to fly the third jumper?

339
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,961
我把它开到大陆, 然后开回来
没有坠毁已经是不错了
I can barely make it there and back
to the mainland, without crashing.

340
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:08,838
最后再说一次, 我是一个医生
不是一个嗜血的战斗机飞行员!
For the last time, I'm a Doctor,
not a bloody fighter pilot!

341
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:13,468
一艘幽灵的飞船在十分钟之内
就会飞临城市的上空
A Wraith dart is gonna be all over
this city inside of ten minutes,

342
00:24:13,593 --> 00:24:16,596
而仅有的真正的战斗机飞行员
却在其他星球
and are only real fighter pilot is offworld.

343
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:20,475
对于我来说, 最希望的就是
尽我们所能构建起最好的防御
I for one, would like to mount
the best defence we can.

344
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,560
很好
Brilliant.

345
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:37,575
二号离开了
所有三艘都出发了
Number two is away. All three are out.

346
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:39,536
祝你好运, Carson
Good luck Carson.

347
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,621
谢谢, 我会需要的
Thanks, I'll need it.

348
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,341
没有效
It's not working.

349
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:54,759
再试一次
Try it again.

350
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:58,221
我已经试了两次
逆序和正序
Look, I've tried it twice.
Backwards and forwards.

351
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,307
我们以前也玩过这个游戏, McKay
We've played this game
before McKay.

352
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,059
试试其它组合
Try some other combination
of the same symbols.

353
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:03,560
你在开玩笑?
Are you joking?

354
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:04,936
你知不知道这会要多久?
Have you any idea how long
that would take?

355
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:07,397
他是对的
有720种地址组合
He's right.
There's 720 possible gate addresses.

356
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:08,690
这是浪费时间
It's a waste of time.

357
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,942
你说过这个地址是第九块石头的位置
You said the address was the location
of the ninth stone.

358
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:13,111
一定是
这个谜题已经有10,000年了
Look, it has to be.
The puzzle is 10,000 years old.

359
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:14,738
也许那个星际之门已经不存在了
Maybe the gate doesn't exist anymore.

360
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:17,657
实际上, 在银河系中
有些文明会埋掉他们的星际之门
Look, back in the milky way,
some cultures actually bury their gates,

361
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:18,700
认为它们毫无用处
to render them useless.

362
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:24,205
可能是其它的
假如这些不是星际之门的符号呢
That's something else.
What if these aren't stargate symbols.

363
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,626
看看它们, 还有可能是什么, 哼??
Look at them What else could they be, huh??

364
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:32,213
实际上, 这些符号可能跟
星际之门没有关系
Actually, these symbols may not
be gate related.

365
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,966
真的么? 你是怎么想的?
Really? What are you thinking?

366
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:41,431
先生们, 它三十秒后
就会出现在你们视野中
Gentlemen, you should have visual
in 30 seconds.

367
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:43,058
准备好了么?
You ready?

368
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:44,559
没有, 我没有准备好
No, I'm not ready.

369
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:46,061
你会做得很好的
You're gonna do fine.

370
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:47,979
可以做得足够好么?
Is fine gonna be good enough?

371
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:50,065
正向你们飞来
Coming right at you.

372
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,233
你看到它了么?
Do you see it yet?

373
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,236
还没有, 我看不到它在哪里
Not yet. I can't see it anywhere.

374
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:05,288
亚特兰蒂斯
Markham和Smith已经被干掉了
Atlantis. Markham and Smith
have been taken out.

375
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:19,094
这座修道院过去是兄弟会中
15位祭司生活的地方
This monastery is where the 15 priests
of the brotherhood used to live.

376
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:20,929
这幅壁画是一张地图
The mural here is a map.

377
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:26,935
记录了当时Suderia的布局
我以前应该想到这一点
A layout of Suderia as it was in their time.
I should have thought of this before.

378
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,772
Suderians人非常崇拜Lantian古人
See, the Suderians worshipped
the Lantian ancestors.

379
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:36,444
星际之门被认为是一个神圣的入口
同时也包括它的符号
The Stargate was considered a sacred portal
and it's symbols, religious icons.

380
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,239
所有36个星际之门的符号
都被编入进来
All 36 gate symbols are incorporated.

381
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,157
这么说将这些符号与石头联系起来....
So connect the symbols to the stones....

382
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:44,869
然后你就可以用三角测量法
找到中心石头埋藏的地点
And you should be able to triangulate
where the centre stone is buried.

383
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,830
你真是一个天才
You're a genius.

384
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:47,914
谢谢 Rodney
Thank you Rodney.

385
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:53,837
好了, 我们都非常感动
不过让我们开始干吧, 嗯?
Yes ok, we're all very impressed,
but let's get on with it, huh?

386
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:01,553
把它打下来!
Shoot it down!

387
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:09,853
它在城市的正中央
我无法下手
It's right in the middle of the city,
I don't have a clean shot.

388
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:16,276
它在做什么?
What's it doing?

389
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,361
在扫描我们
It's scanning us.

390
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:36,004
哼
Huh.

391
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:38,590
我本希望可以稍微缩小一点范围
I was hoping it would narrow
the area down a little more.

392
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:40,800
这值得一试
Well, it's worth a shot.

393
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,511
地图上所标示的地区有多大?
How big an area does that
represent on the map.

394
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:45,847
几平方英里
Several square miles.

395
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:50,477
等等 这是他们符号中的一部分
Hold on a second. It's part of their symbol.

396
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,783
15的记号 是的
The mark of the 15. Yes.

397
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:06,659
什么?
What?

398
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,621
这是一个15线图形 15线
It's a 15 line symbol. 15 lines.

399
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:11,331
九条线在外面
Nine lines on the outside.

400
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,957
代表着九个石头的携带者
Representing the stone carriers.

401
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,792
六条在里面
Six on the inside.

402
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:19,797
代表着五个保卫者和首领
Representing the five protectors
and the master handler.

403
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,591
你知道那是哪里么?
Do you know where that is?

404
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,009
是的, 我可以带你去那
Yes, I can take you there.

405
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,094
别忙

406
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,769
抓紧了! 再等一秒钟
Hold tight! One more second.

407
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,445
好的
Yes.

408
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:46,324
不是我们干的
至少我认为不是我们干的
We didn't do that.
At least I don't think we did.

409
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:51,913
不管发生了什么, 它已经死了
亚特兰蒂斯, 我们把它干掉了
Well whatever happened, it's dead.
Atlantis, we have a kill.

410
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:57,252
这是个好消息, 飞船2号
现在回来吧
Good news Jumper 2. Now head on home.

411
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:05,802
给我一把小刀
Someone give me a knife.

412
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:11,849
你们都有枪呢
给我一把小刀
You all have guns. Someone give me a knife.

413
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,311
去吧
Go ahead.

414
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,695
Rodney!
Rodney!

415
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,574
这个地图并不是在告诉我们
应该到哪里去找那块中心石头
It's not a map to where
the centre stone is,

416
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,994
那块中心石头实际上就在这里
瞧
it is where the centre stone is. Look.

417
00:29:51,681 --> 00:29:53,641
我们已经找全了
We have all the pieces.

418
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:57,604
恭喜你, McKay博士
你们可以继续活下去了
Congratulations Dr McKay. You may live yet.

419
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:13,578
没指望了
没有什么暗门或者密道
This is pointless.
No trap doors or hidden passageways.

420
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,835
也许这里不只一个出口, 少校
There may be more than
one way in here Major.

421
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,796
当你试图隐藏一个密室时
你并不会想在那个地方
When you're trying to hide a chamber,
you don't think much of entrances

422
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,298
设置多个走道和出口
and exits all over the damn place.

423
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,635
你情愿就坐在那里
等着他们回来?
You'd rather just sit here
and wait for them to come back?

424
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,679
你们有什么可以派得上用场的东西?
What have you got
that we can use?

425
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:36,684
我有两块干粮, 一些弹药,
以及一些医疗用品
I got a couple of MRE's, some ammo,
some med supplies.

426
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,647
这还可以
That's a start.

427
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,858
我有两个闪光弹
我想可能还有用
I've got a couple of flash bangs.
I think that's about it though.

428
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,485
闪光弹?
Flash bangs?

429
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,613
是的, 有点像手榴弹
拉开扣环, 按下引信
Well, kind of like, grenades.
Pull the pin, depress the trigger.

430
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:51,407
一旦你激发引信 大概1.5秒之后
Once you let the spoon pop,
you've got about 1.5 seconds,

431
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:54,118
整个房间就会充满
亮度为240万烛光的闪光
before the room's filled with
2.4 million candle power,

432
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,162
它同时还会发出
175分贝的巨大声响
and a bang that's rated at 175 decibels.

433
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,832
可以让没有保护好
眼睛和耳朵的人
Stun anyone with their
eyes and ears open,

434
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:01,918
眩晕大概10秒钟
for about ten seconds.

435
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:11,552
你在做什么?
你准备把我们从这里挖出去么?
What are you doing?
You gonna dig us out of here?

436
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:16,557
差不多吧
过来帮帮我
Something like that.
Come over here and give me a hand.

437
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:27,360
嘿, 你还想要Sora回去么?
难道我们的协议只是这些?
Hey, you want Sora back?
Is that what this is all about?

438
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,613
Sora知道她在做什么
比大多数人都清楚
Sora knew what she was doing,
moreso than most of the men.

439
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:33,616
而且, Genii从来不跟恐怖分子
签订协议
Besides, the Genii do not make
deals with terrorists.

440
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:36,119
恐怖分子? 是你袭击我们!
Terrorists? You attacked us!

441
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,162
那也是在你们先到我们的星球上
设计埋伏我们之后
After you ambushed us on our own world.

442
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:38,913
这真是太疯狂了
This is crazy.

443
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:41,249
我们大家都是想保护自己的人民
We're both just trying to protect
our people.

444
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,835
很对
不过如果把你的人民作为目标
That is correct.
But if making your people a target,

445
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,546
可以为我的人民赢得更多的时间的话
这样做还是值得的
buys my people more time,
it will have been worth it.

446
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,380
听着....
Listen....

447
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:51,217
我不想再跟你争论这个了, 博士!
I don't wanna discuss it
any further Doctor!

448
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,388
找到ZPM, 然后你们就都可以
会到亚特兰蒂斯
Find the ZPM and you can
all return to Atlantis.

449
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,557
如果失败了 协议就自动终止
Fail and the deal's off.

450
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,816
到底发生了什么?
So what happened out there?

451
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:09,986
正当我们可以射击的时候
它自己爆炸了
As soon as we had a clean shot,
it self destructed.

452
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,112
为什么?
Why?

453
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:13,823
女士, 我不知道
我认为它到这里不是来战斗的
Ma'am. I have no idea.
I don't think it came here to fight.

454
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,992
它看起来对我们的飞船也没有兴趣
It didn't seem that interested in the jumpers,

455
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:18,578
除非我们挡住了它飞向城市的路时
except for when we were blocking
it's way to the city.

456
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,581
幽灵的这种飞船并不是
远程战斗机
Darts are not long range fighters.

457
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,835
事实上它这么远只身前来
应该是为了侦查
The fact it came so far alone.
It was a scout.

458
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:29,547
那它为什么要自毁呢?
侦查不就意味着要传送信息么
Well why would it self destruct?
Scouts are mean't to relay information.

459
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:32,133
它确实传送了信息
But it did relay information.

460
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:38,347
看, 就在它爆炸之前
那艘飞船一直在传送数据
Look, just before it exploded,
the Dart was transmitting data.

461
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:46,856
我想你不能....
I don't suppose you could....

462
00:32:46,981 --> 00:32:47,899
至少现在不行
Not any time soon, at least.

463
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:49,817
我们可以判断信息是发往哪里么?
Can we determine where it was sending it?

464
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:56,407
我可以引导远程探测器指向那块区域
能不能给我几个小时?
I could direct long range sensors to that area.
Give me a couple of hours?

465
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:03,456
我想我们应该把石头放在基座上
I just assumed that we'd place
the stones on the pedestal,

466
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,999
然后让人把手掌
have someone put their hands

467
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:07,710
放在这个掌印上
幸运的话, 我们就可以得到ZPM
on the palm prints and hopefully
we'd get the ZPM.

468
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:10,546
现在的问题是, 我们应该按照
什么顺序来摆放这些石头?
The question is,
what order do we put the stones in?

469
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,173
我认为直接依次摆放即可
I think it's pretty straight forward.

470
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:15,343
现在没有什么是很直接的!
你认为应该是什么?
Well, nothing's been straightforward yet!
What makes you think this would be?

471
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:18,596
只有最后一块石头上的凹槽
才跟中心位置对应
The last stone is the only one with grooves
that match the centre position.

472
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:19,472
然后呢?
So?

473
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,809
然后它就可以顺顺贴贴的放在那个位置
接着完成整个图案并拿到 ZPM
So it fits snugly into place.
Complete the pattern and get the ZPM.

474
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,436
都到这个地步了
他们还会玩什么把戏?
Why would they continue to play
games at this point?

475
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,688
我想你并没有真正理解
这些人是怎么想的
I really don't think you understand
how these people thought.

476
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:29,774
McKay, 不要拖延时间了
McKay, stop stalling.

477
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:32,026
我并不是拖延时间, 我只是认为
我们需要看清事实....
I'm not stalling, I just think we need
to consider the fact....

478
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:37,031
Prenos, 请你过去摆好石头
然后拿到ZPM
Prenos, arrange the stones and retrieve
the ZPM please.

479
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:51,337
McKay!
McKay!

480
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,673
你要我做什么?
What do you want me to do?

481
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,887
这是什么?
What's this?

482
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:15,653
他死了 你知道这会发生的
He's dead. You knew this would happen.

483
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:19,824
是的, 是的我知道
Yes, yes I did.

484
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:24,453
事实上, 我正要跟你说
In fact, I was in the middle
of telling you as much,

485
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,624
正在这时你却让他去激活基座
when you ordered him to activate
the pedestal.

486
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:31,377
是你杀了他, 不是我
Look, you killed him, not me.

487
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,343
这些石头的正确顺序到底是什么?
What's the correct order of the stones?

488
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:41,429
现在我也不知道
I'm not sure yet.

489
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,815
好吧, 你现在有四次尝试的机会
Well you'll have four chances to get it right.

490
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:55,026
你先去
You go first.

491
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,994
一旦你想开始....
Any time you wanna start....

492
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,787
我在想, 我在想...
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

493
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,372
好吧, 我们试了从一到九
Right, we tried one to nine.

494
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:09,248
谢谢, 是的
Thankyou, yes.

495
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,207
那试试从九到一如何?
How about nine to one?

496
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,417
也许, Prenos是对的
Possibly, look Prenos was right.

497
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,377
中心石头是唯一那个可以
放在这个地方的
The centre stone is the only
one that locks into place.

498
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,712
所有其它的必须已到周围去
All the others must move around it.

499
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:16,255
我在想一种组合
I'm just trying to think
of a combination

500
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,798
可以让五处于中间
that makes sense with
five in the middle.

501
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:21,552
十五 一定是跟15, 9或者5有关
Fifteen. It's gotta have something
to do with 15, or 9 or 5.

502
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:24,055
别说了, 求求你
我正在思考
Shut up, please. I'm trying to think.

503
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,765
我不会住嘴的, Rodney
我的命就押在这上面了
I'm not gonna shut up Rodney,
my life's at stake.

504
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,642
很对, 既然这样就请安静一下
让我想想怎么救你!
Exactly. So simmer down and let me save it!

505
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,310
听过这种说法么?
两个脑袋比一个要聪明
Ever heard the term,
two heads are better than one?

506
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,811
这是公众的误解
It's a common misconception.

507
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:32,396
给我一把枪, 我想自杀!
Give me the gun and I'll shoot him myself!

508
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,190
你们花的时间已经太多了
做出选择然后开始
This is taking too long. Choose and go.

509
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:35,650
怎么, 你急着去投胎?
What, you got somewhere you gotta be?

510
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:37,735
做出选择然后开始!
Choose and go!

511
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:40,905
我没有主意
I got nothing.

512
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:42,949
谢谢你鼓舞人心的话
Thanks for the pep talk.

513
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,993
从九到一, 我能想到的只有这个
Nine to one, that's all I can think of.

514
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:47,870
好吧, 退后
Ok, step back.

515
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:49,288
抱歉
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,873
我还没有死
I'm not dead yet.

517
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:52,959
是的, 抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

518
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,300
少校, 开始吧!
Major. Now!

519
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,522
我知道了!
I got it!

520
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:15,106
什么?
What?

521
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:16,607
15人组成的brotherhood
The brotherhood of 15.

522
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:20,069
数字1到9可以被放在一个
3乘以3的格子里
The numbers 1-9 can be put
in a three by three grid,

523
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:22,822
并且在每个方向加起来都等于15
so they add up to 15 in every direction.

524
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,574
噢, 你是对的! 你是怎么知道的?
Oh, you're right! How did you know that?

525
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,368
这曾经在mensa的测试中出现过
It was on a mensa test.

526
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:28,327
你是mensa的成员?
You're a member of mensa?

527
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,578
不, 不过我参加过测试
No, but I took the test.

528
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,497
什么时候?
When?

529
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,541
我现在不想谈这个, Rodney
I don't wanna talk about his now Rodney?

530
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,626
好的, 好的
Right, right.

531
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,337
OK. 2, 9, 4
Ok. 2, 9, 4.

532
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:45,761
7, 5, 3...6,1,8.
就是这, 应该就是这样
7, 5, 3...6,1,8. That's it, that's gotta be it.

533
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:47,847
祝你好运
Good luck.

534
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,706
到底发生什么了?
What the hell just happened?

535
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:57,583
你还好吧?
Are you ok?

536
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,001
是的, 谢谢你
Yes, thankyou.

537
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,045
抱歉Rodney, 我没法告诉你
即将发生什么
Sorry Rodney, I had no way of telling
you what was coming.

538
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,422
我的眼睛! 我的眼睛什么都看不见了
My eyes? I need my eyes for seeing.

539
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,257
去拿ZPM, Rodney.
Get the ZPM, Rodney.

540
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:09,512
这是一个小小的奇迹
我居然还能够辨认出轮廓
It's a small miracle
I can still make out shapes.

541
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:11,597
我想说的就是这些
That's all I'm saying.

542
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,352
不要看我
Don't look at me.

543
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:24,985
好吧, 我们要从这里出去
Alright, we're getting out of here.

544
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:28,697
大约一小时后
我们会让村民把你拉上去
We'll send the villagers to pick you up
in about an hour.

545
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:32,201
现在最聪明的做法就是把我杀掉
The smart thing would be to kill me now.

546
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:49,677
你是对的 告诉你吧
我也希望这样做会对将来有所好处
You're right. I tell you what,
I'm gonna want points for this in the future.

547
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:54,598
不过如果你胆敢再这样做的话
我一定会杀了你的 明白?
But if you ever do this again,
I will kill you. Deal?

548
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:05,693
都还好吧?
We good?

549
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:08,112
是的, 直到我能够看见
Yeah, as far as I can see.

550
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:10,489
我们出去
Let's move out.

551
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,702
我简直无法相信, 你从来没有提起
任何关于Mensa的事情
I can't believe you never mentioned
the Mensa thing.

552
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:16,579
我接受了测试 不过我从来没有加入
I took the test. I never joined.

553
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:17,496
你通过了?
But you passed?

554
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,247
是的
Yes.

555
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:20,249
好吧, 你知道, 我们在亚特兰蒂斯
也有一个题目
Well you know, we have a chapter on Atlantis

556
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:22,918
Rodney, Rodney. 拉绳子吧
Rodney, Rodney. Up the rope.

557
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,214
我想我们从来没有找到
这么好的东西
I thought we'd never find one
of those things.

558
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:29,008
我今晚一定会睡得很甜的
I'm gonna sleep pretty soundly tonight.

559
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:33,137
我可不行 我必须整晚工作
让每个系统都重新运转起来
Not me. I'm gonna be up all night getting
every system I can, back on line.

560
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:37,224
Eleena, 我想我们真不知道
该如何报答你
Eleena, I don't think we will ever
be able to properly repay you for this.

561
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,310
你们没必要报答我
You won't have to.

562
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,696
对不起?
I'm sorry?

563
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:56,076
好了, 好了, 放松, 放松!
Alright. Alright, easy. Easy!

564
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,372
Eleena? 你跟Genii人串通好了?
Eleena? You involved the Genii?

565
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:07,004
这跟Genii人没有任何关系
我是新一届brotherhood的成员
This has nothing to do with the Genii.
I am a member of the new brotherhood.

566
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:08,797
那这是干什么?
What is this about?

567
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:14,345
数十代人以前, 在一次残酷的洗劫之后
brotherhood被消灭了
Ten generations ago, after a severe culling,
the brotherhood was destroyed.

568
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:19,016
我们当中的很多人找到了他们的笔记
并下决心要完成
Many of us found their writings
and decided to try and complete

569
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:22,311
古人交付给我们的任务
the task handed down to us by the ancestors.

570
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:24,396
我就是新的首领
I am the new master handler.

571
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:27,858
我们要谢谢你们帮我们找到了Potentia
We thank you for helping us
find the Potentia.

572
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:30,361
不过它必须再次被保藏起来
But it must go into hiding again.

573
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:34,490
我们就是来自古人的城市
那个ZPM就是留给我们的
We come from the city of the ancestors.
That ZPM was intended for us.

574
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:39,662
不, 你们只是住在 Atlantis
你们并不是古人
No. You live in Atlantis,
but you are not the ancestors.

575
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:42,248
你跟她说了什么?
What did you tell her?

576
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,043
如果我们不把这个ZPM拿回去
亚特兰蒂斯就会陷落
Atlantis might fall if we don't take
this ZPM back.

577
00:40:46,168 --> 00:40:47,795
那样的话你们这样做就毫无意义了
Then it would serve no purpose.

578
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,839
你认为古人希望看到的就是这个?
You really think the ancestors
would have wanted that?

579
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:53,175
我们都不知道他们的计划
None of us can know their plan.

580
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,218
他们并没有什么计划
They don't have a plan.

581
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:57,596
你认为被幽灵袭击
并且被赶出这个星系
You think getting attacked by the Wraith
and getting chased out of the galaxy

582
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,973
也是他们所计划的么?
is something they planned for?

583
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:01,141
Eleena, 你这样想
实在是有点聪明过头了....
Eleena, you're far too smart to think that....

584
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,520
potentia将会被藏到另外一个星球
The potentia will be put into
hiding on another world.

585
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:08,524
当古人回来的时候
我们的人民就会得到丰厚的回报
When the ancestors return,
our people will be greatly rewarded.

586
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:10,609
Eleena, 那可能让你
觉得有点难以置信
Eleena, you can't believe that.

587
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,821
这样, 跟我们一起回去
我会证明给你看的
Well, come back with us.
Let me prove it to you.

588
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:18,909
事情应该就是这样
现在你们应该走了
This is how it must be.
Now it is time for you to leave.

589
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:33,424
你们试图解释了么?
Did you try to explain?

590
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:36,093
我试过了 相信我, 我们试过了
I tried. Believe me, we tried.

591
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:37,344
我们本可以用上它的
We could have used it.

592
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,178
当然我们可以
Of course we could

593
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,889
不, 你们不明白
当你们还在其它星球的时候
No, you don't understand.
While you were offworld,

594
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,766
一艘幽灵的飞船飞到我们城市的上空
a Wraith Dart flew over our city.

595
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:44,310
抱歉?
I'm sorry?

596
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,603
我们失去了一艘飞船
同时还有Markham和Smith
We lost a Jumper,
along with Markham and Smith.

597
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:48,647
什么?
We what?

598
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,149
而且它还扫描了我们
And it scanned us.

599
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:54,069
我们刚刚失去了两个在飞船中的人
为什么不早点告诉我
We just lost two of my men in a Jumper
and this is the first time I'm hearing about it?

600
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:57,698
我试图通过无线电联系你
不过十二小时以来一直联系不上
I tried to reach you, but you've been out
of radio contact for twelve hours.

601
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:59,992
幽灵的飞船已经向
深空传送了一些信息
Now the Dart sent a transmission
deep into space

602
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,619
并且在我们可以抓住它之前自毁了
and then it self destructed
before we could get to it.

603
00:42:02,745 --> 00:42:05,247
我们用我们的深空探测器
扫描了那片区域...
We scanned the area with our
deep space sensors and...

604
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:06,623
我们有深空探测器?
We have deep space sensors?

605
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:08,500
是的, 说来话长
Yeah. It's a long story.

606
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,628
我们还发现了一些更为不安的东西
We found something else rather unsettling.

607
00:42:11,754 --> 00:42:14,465
我已经很不安了
给我看吧
I'm already unsettled. Show me.

608
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,934
那些是什么?
What are those?

609
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,273
幽灵的母船, 一共有三个
系统刚刚分析完....
Wraith Hive ships. 3 of them.
The system analysis just got back....

610
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:33,442
很好, 他们的目的地是哪里?
Great. Where are they headed?

611
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:36,653
如果它们保持现有的航向和速度
If they maintain direction and speed,

612
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:40,657
在两个星期之内就会达到我们的星球


they'll be over our planet
within two weeks.
