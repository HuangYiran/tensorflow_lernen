第一季  第三集

29
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,220
这是2048年
The year is 2048.

30
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,580
不断发展的科技渐渐不受管束
Evolving technologies can no longer be regulated.

31
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,830
危险的高新技术永久地改变了犯罪的领域
Dangerous advancements forever alter the criminal landscape.

32
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,060
警察措手不及
Police are not prepared.

33
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,200
为与这种罪恶抗争 执法机关采用了新型防御武器
Law enforcement combats this corruption with a new line of defense.

34
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,610
但这些武器并不全然相同
But not all are created equal.

35
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,750
DRN的设计初衷是让其尽可能的和人类接近
The idea behind the DRNs was to be as human as possible.

36
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,900
他们是基于一个叫人造灵魂的项目而开发
They were based on a program called Synthetic Soul.

37
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,190
这是疯了的那款吧
That's one of the crazy ones.

38
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,860
- 我带你去 - 我们走
- I'll lead you in? - Let's go.

39
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,680
现在所有的警察
Now all cops...

40
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,500
人类联手人造人一起战斗 保护人民
human and manmade together... take on the battle to watch over us all.

41
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,840
充电已完成
Charge at capacity.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,900
嘿
Hey.

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,110

- Morning, Mr. Navarro. - How you doing?

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,890
米勒小姐
Miss Miller.

46
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,140
哦 詹姆斯
Oh. James.

47
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,630
你又忘记把钥匙从锁上取下来了
Left your key in the lock again.

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,810
谢谢你
Thank you.

49
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,290
我发誓我的记忆力一天比一天糟
I swear my memory gets worse every day.

50
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,740
我告诉过你 如果你想的话
I told you, I can have maintenance come in

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,260
我可以让维修工过来 把它们都换成生物锁
and switch those out for bio locks if you'd like.

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,690
没关系啦 我还是喜欢传统方式
That's all right, I prefer the old-fashioned way.

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,560
- 我一定很可笑吧 - 没 我挺喜欢的
- I'm funny, I guess. - No, no, no, I like that.

54
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,200
这个送到了安检台 是给你的
Uh, this came to the security desk for you.

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,470
哦 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

56
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,200
我得回到岗位上去了
I got to get back to the desk.

57
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,270
再见
See you.

58
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,240
你好 需要帮忙吗
Hi, can I help you?

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,810
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

60
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,580
詹姆斯
James.

61
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,880
我们走
Let's go.

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,520
服务器机房

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,180
你知道我最喜欢你的哪方面吗
You know what I love best about you?

64
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,340
你的守时
Your punctuality.

65
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,120
你这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,230
你迟到了 
You're late

67
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,150
而且这车一股橄榄油味儿
and the car smells like olive oil.

68
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,710
拿着这个 
Hold this...

69
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,010
还有这个
and this.

70
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,990
我在做些什么
What am I doing here?

71
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,670
帮我热咖啡
You're heating my coffee.

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,300
嘿
Hey!

73
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
我喜欢喝热的
I like it hot.

74
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,020
咖啡的最佳饮用温度在68到80摄氏度
It's best between 155 and 175 degrees.

75
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,080
大多数人喜欢喝80度的
Most people prefer it at 175.

76
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,390
你喜欢74度的 它现在就是这个温度
You like it at 165, and that's what it is.

77
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,690
你连我喜欢喝怎样的咖啡都知道
You know how I like my coffee?

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,090
对 我不像你 我注意细节
Yes, I, unlike you, pay attention to details,

79
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,550
比如现在几点了
like what time it is

80
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,800
还有你几点该接你的搭档一起去换班
and what time you're supposed to pick up your partner for shift.

81
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,170
我也注意细节的
Oh, I pay attention to details,

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,710
比如你刚刚把手指伸进了我的咖啡
like you just put your finger in my coffee.

83
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,270
如果你喜欢的话 我可以把它伸到别的地方去
If you'd like, I could put it somewhere else.

84
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,440
等等等等 回去
Wa-Wa-Wait, go back.

85
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,280
- 回到哪去 - 回到我没有搭档的时候
- To where? - To when I didn't have a partner

86
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,080
我可以安静地开车去上班
and I could drive to work in peace.

87
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,750
我知道你听从我的建议
I know you took my advice

88
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,680
在你的腿上涂了橄榄油 约翰
and used olive oil on your leg, John,

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,020
确实有效
and it works.

90
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,850
你只是太固执了
You're just too stubborn

91
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,290
不会说谢谢 但是不用客气
to say thank you, but you're welcome.

92
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,590
我吃了份沙拉 一份希腊沙拉
I ate a salad... a Greek salad.

93
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,590
希腊沙拉中会添加橄榄油

94
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,730
早上八点就吃
At 10:00 a.m.?

95
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,900
天啊 你可真是当侦探的料
Boy, you're some detective.

96
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,040
真不容易 这才对嘛
Finally. Now you're talking.

97
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,770
接到报案 凶杀案
13 RAY. Possible 31.

98
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,770
似乎还在进行中
Homicide.

99
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,940
在新月街4500号发现尸体
Body discovered at 4500 Crescent Av.

100
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,080
离这三个街区
That's three blocks away.

101
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,310
好啦 我们去工作吧
All right, let's go to work.

102
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,030
你们在这里多久了
How long you been here?

103
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,530
我们也刚到
We just got here.

104
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,630
枪击时没有目击者
There were no witnesses to the shooting.

105
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,270
案件发生在过去的二十分钟内
The incident happened within the last 20 minutes.

106
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,630
谁发现的他
Who found him?

107
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,420
这两个人 
These two,

108
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,080
我们已经封锁了这片区域
and we've cordoned off the area.

109
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
他们毁掉了摄像头
They killed the cameras.

110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,900
我想我应该可以读取到已存档的录像
I think I can still access the archived footage.

111
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,330
约翰
John...

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,370
他们去了二十五层
They went up to the 25th floor.

113
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,110
他们关闭了电梯
They shut down the elevator.

114
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,320
把安保录像传送给马尔多纳多
Transmit that security footage to Maldonado,

115
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,770
我们也许能查到这些家伙的身份
so we can try and I.D. these guys.

116
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,300
哈里森警官 去请求支援
Officer Harrison, call for backup

117
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,070
并执行疏散方案
and begin evacuation protocols.

118
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,950
遵命
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,300
注意安全 嫌疑犯仍在这所建筑物中
And be careful. Perps are still in the building.

120
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,870
没问题
You got it.

121
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,880
计划是什么
What's the plan?

122
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,250
我也不知道
I got no idea...

123
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,880
但是我们有二十五层楼的时间想出来
but we got 25 floors to figure it out.

124
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,350
交出手机
Hand over the phone.

125
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,740
闭嘴
Shut your mouth.

126
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,030
交出来
Hand it over.

127
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,800
不要说话
Stop talking.

128
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,780
让我看见它 嘿
Let me see it... hey, hey.

129
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,740
我说了
I told you,

130
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,880
坐下
you sit down.

131
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,010
你好
Hello.

132
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,560
你叫什么
What's your name?

133
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,850
你不知道该怎么回答 是吗
Oh, you, you don't know how to answer that, do you?

134
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,950
你担心如果你回答了 你会受伤 是吧
You're afraid if you answer, you'll get hurt, huh?

135
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,640
可是唯一能避免受伤的方法
Well... the only way around that is...

136
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,270
就是你如实回答
that you answer honestly.

137
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,670
这总是最佳对策
It's always the best policy.

138
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,590
詹娜
Jenna.

139
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,220
你为何不来加入我呢 詹娜
Why don't you come and join me, Jenna?

140
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,590
喂
Yo.

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,400
我们可以开始了
We can start now.

142
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,310
警察还在大厅里
Cops are still in the lobby.

143
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,740
那就是他们的错了
Well, that's their fault.

144
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,240
是时候让他们注意到我们了
It's time to get their attention.

145
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,060
闪开 闪开
Out of the way, out of the way.

146
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,960
蹲下
Stay down.

147
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,480

148
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,380
这不是演习
This is not a drill.

149
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,500
- 怎么回事 - 先生 请您继续走
- What's going on? - Sir, we need you to keep moving,

150
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,910
直到走出大楼

151
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
- 下楼梯 - 外面怎么了

152
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,880
- 请出去 - 今天不用上班了
- Out of the building, please. - Take the rest of the day off.

153
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,080
去楼梯那里 从大楼后门出去
Move to the stairs, exit the back of the building.

154
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
现在什么情况 斯特尔

155
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,160
市中心的桑德森大楼出事了

156
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,290
约翰正在爬楼梯 目前在第二层

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,760
约翰
John!

159
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,860
你那什么情况
What's your status?

160
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,470
多利安说大楼结构还是安全的

161
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,600
第三和第四层的紧急出口被破坏了

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,600
紧急救援人员正在把人们从第二层撤离
Emergency personnel are getting people out by the second story.

164
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,670
约翰 别爬楼梯了

165
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,670
我不允许

166
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,870
继续把员工引导至二层 然后你也待在那儿
Continue to direct the employees to the second floor and go there yourself

167
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,370
直到我们弄清对手是谁
until we know what we're dealing with here.

168
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,650
我知道对手是谁
I know what we're dealing with.

169
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,740
攻击者还在楼内
The assailants are still in the building.

170
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,910
我们去追他
We're going after them.

171
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,880
给我点时间
Buy me some time.

172
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,080
你应该启动装置

173
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,840
阻断所有进出大楼的信号

174

175
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,850
再给我找些后援

176
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,450
约翰 如果我们阻断信号 通讯信号就传不出大楼
John, if we jam the signal, comms won't make it out of the building.

177
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,560
我们就无法联系了
We won't be able to communicate.

178
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,490
请你立刻离开大楼
Leave the building now.

179
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,800
这... 我不...
There's... I can't...

180
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,970
啥... 做...
What... do...

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,540
是否...
Do you...

182
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,370
圣诞
Christmas.

183
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
你竟然挂断了马尔多纳多队长的电话
Did you just hang up on Captain Maldonado?

184
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,040
反正她总说那些无聊的话
Yeah, boring conversation anyway.

185
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,580
我就喜欢你这态度 不服从命令 还理直气壮
I just love that you wear your insubordination like it's a virtue.

186
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,850
人们都撤出区域了吗
Did we evacuate the perimeter?

187
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,350
按照疏散方案 三个街区都已清空
Per protocol, three-block radius.

188
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,920
我是保罗
Yeah, this is Paul.

189
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,790
截断一切通讯

190
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,390
启动通讯封堵

191
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,370
启动序列

192
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,740
好的 信号已激活
Okay, signal active.

193
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,200
转换至内部通讯
Switching to internal comms.

194
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,640
他们堵了通信
They jammed us.

195
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,410
所有外部通信通道都断了
All external communications are blocked.

196
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,520
预测执法者的举动真是容易
Law enforcement is nothing if not predictable.

197
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,150
A队 盯住南边

198
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,020
B队 盯住屋顶
Bravo team, take the rooftop.

199
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,010
没有命令不要开枪
Hold your fire until instructed.

200
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,260
安全
Clear.

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,610
那个计划有什么进展没
Any more thoughts on that plan?

202
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,440
我们都快到了 约翰
We're running out of floors, John.

203
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,770
我以为这会儿后援就到了
Well, I thought backup would be here by now.

204
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,140
看来只能继续往上了
Guess we just keep moving up.

205
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,610
也许还有别的方法
Maybe there's another option.

206
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,440
这里的通风系统是相通的
The entire air system is interconnected.

207
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
我们只需要到二十三层
We just have to make it to the 23rd floor.

208
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,790
二十三层有个通风口 能把我们带到那帮人那儿
There's an access door to the air system there that'll take us up to where these guys are.

209
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,520
看吧 都说了我们会想到办法的
See? Told you we'd come up with a plan.

210
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,460
嘿
Hey.

211
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,860
你脸上怎么有迪斯科花纹
What's with the disco face?

212
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,660
你想说什么
Got something to tell me?

213
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
因为通讯被堵住了
Since the signals are now being jammed,

214
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,450
这栋楼里所有的紧急电话都打出不去 
every emergency call being placed in this building is bouncing back to me

215
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,870
所以都转给了我
because they can't get out.

216
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,110
接电话 也许我们能知道一些信息
Answer the calls. We might get some information.

217
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,860
你好
Hello?

218
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,760
谢天谢地 我需要警察帮助 我在办公室里 刚才发生了爆炸

219
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,580
别着急女士 我知道了 警察正在赶来的路上

220
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,490
请您先移步至二楼

221
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,550
你这是搞什么
What are you doing?

222
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,950
在葡萄牙文化中
In the Portuguese culture,

223
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,660
已经证明女性的声音在危机时刻
it is proven that people find a woman's voice more soothing

224
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,430
更能舒缓情绪
in moments of crisis.

225
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,760
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello? - Hello.

229
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,970
请保持冷静
Please remain calm.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
我...我这里有一个枪手

231

请帮帮我

232
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,470

237

我不知道
I don't know.

238
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,830
我妹妹在他们手上
They have my sister...

263

我可以告诉你 不过我不想让你的努力白白浪费
Well, I'd tell you, but I don't want to nullify your efforts.

273
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,980
既然我们已经引起了你的注意
Now that we have your attention...

274

Paige, can you hold the phone up so I can hear what's going on?

00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,200
我真的不想再把人质扔出去了
I really hate to throw out any more hostages.

277
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,610
我们就有话直说吧 如何
Let's get down to brass tacks, huh?

278
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,950
你想怎么样
What do you want?

279
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,140
第一
First,

280
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,210
让你的狙击手从屋顶撤离 
get your snipers off the roof,

281
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,120
然后告诉那些集合在楼下待命的人
and tell those men you have assembled out front to stand down,

282
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,250
让他们远离这座大厦
and keep them away from the building,

283
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,990
否则还会有人质从天而降
or hostages will continue to fall from the sky.

284
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,500
告诉保罗探员让他的人撤离

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,050
好了
Done.

288
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,520
还有什么
What else?

289
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,210
我们要三架垂直起降飞机在屋顶待命 
We'd like three v-tols on the roof standing by,

290
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,150
确保我们安全到达边境
clear airspace from here to the border,

291
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,610
最后 我要一个裂变触发器
and finally, I'd like one fission igniter delivered to me, please.

292
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,830
那是军用武器
That's military-grade technology.

293
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,530
我无权支配
I don't have that authority.

294
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,130
那我建议你联系有这个权限的人
Well, then I suggest you contact someone who does.

295
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,970
面部识别成功

296
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,580
你现在听我说 卢卡斯
Now, you listen to me, Lucas,

297
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,920
如果你想让我跟你合作

298
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,020
那么你也要配合我
I need you to cooperate with me.

299
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,590
你手上有多少人质
How many hostages do you have?

300
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,450
多到如果他们死了 你的饭碗就保不住了
More than enough to end your career if they die.

301
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,600
你还有四十三分钟
You have 43 minutes.

302
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,280
定时器设为四十三分钟 让鲁迪・洛姆来见我
Set the timer for 43 minutes, and get me Rudy Lom.

303
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,750

你还在吗
Are you there?

305
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,720
我在 佩吉
Right here, Paige.

306
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,360
有人来救我们吗
Is anyone coming?

307
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,420
你要撑住
You just hang tight.

308
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,360
我们马上就去救你
We're gonna be with you real soon.

309
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,230
你听到他们的对话了吗
Did you hear the phone call?

310
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,070
是的 我听到了 谢谢你
Yeah, I did. Thank you.

311
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,240
不要挂断 我马上回来
Just hold on a second. I'll be right back.

312
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,880
裂变触发器真有我想的那么危险吗
Is a fission igniter as bad as I think it is?

313
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,620
这是一个大型爆炸装置的触发系统
It's a trigger mechanism for a large explosive device.

314
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,220
百万吨级别
Megaton level.

315
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,580
百万吨
Megaton.

316
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,220
佩吉 你在吗
Paige, you there?

317
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,550
你能告诉我他们手上有多少人质吗
Can you tell me how many hostages they've got up there?

318
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,290
二十五个左右
25 or so.

319
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,260
至少在这个房间是这样
At least in this room.

320
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,260
我看不太清楚
It's hard for me to see.

321
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,860
你做得很好 佩吉
You're doing great, Paige.

322
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,130
你妹妹怎么样
How's your sister?

323
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,400
都是我的错
This is all my fault.

324
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,460
要不是我她就不会在这
She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

325
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,700
她从镇子上来
She's visiting from out of town.

326
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,370
只是路过这里 想和我吃午饭
She just stopped by to have lunch...

327
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,900
可现在她却要独自面对这些
and now she's all alone.

328
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,740
佩吉 你能告诉我有多少持枪的人吗
Paige, can you tell me how many gunmen there are?

329
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,680
他们一直走来走去 我不知道
People keep coming and going; I don't know.

330
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,850
至少...五六个
Five... six, at least.

331
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,450
但应该更多
But there were more.

332
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,090
对不起 我做不到
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

333
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,930
我太害怕了
I'm so scared.

334
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,830
佩吉 你以前冰钓过么
Paige, you ever been ice fishing?

335
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,940
没
No.

336
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,710
我十一岁的时候
When I was 11 years old,

337
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,510
我爸带我去麦克法兰湖冰钓
my dad took me ice fishing to Lake McFarland.

338
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,720
准备回家的时候 突然间
We were coming back, and all of a sudden

339
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,550
冰面裂开了 我正好掉进去
the ice cracked, and I went right under.

340
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,290
我看不见 也无法呼吸
I couldn't see, I couldn't breathe.

341
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,430
我以为我就要死了
I thought I was gonna die.

342
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:17,340
湖水非常冷 像无数根针在扎我的全身一样
The water was so cold, it was like thousands of needles stinging every part of my body.

343
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,940
就在那时我爸跳了下来
And then my dad jumped in,

344
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,040
他抓住我 把我往岸上拖
and he grabbed me and started dragging me back to shore.

345
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,810
你想让她睡着么
Are you trying to put her to sleep?

346
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,540
即使我们还没脱离危险
And even though we were still in a lot of danger,

347
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,190
我却感觉很安全
I felt safe.

348
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,620
我觉得
I felt like...

349
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,990
一切都会好的
everything was gonna be okay,

350
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,120
因为我不是一个人
because I wasn't alone.

351
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,390
佩吉
Paige...

352
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,120
你不是孤身一人
you're not alone.

353
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,390
我会陪着你
I'm with you.

354
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,560
一切都会没事的
Everything is gonna be okay.

355
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,430
你相信我么
Do you believe me?

356
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,800
我相信
Yeah, I do.

357
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,880
很好 好姑娘
All right, good girl.

358
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,010
你要坚持下去
You just hang in there.

359
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,720
保罗
Yeah. Paul.

360
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,750
肯尼思和多利安有什么消息么
Any sign of Kennex and Dorian?

361
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,950
目前还没有
Uh, nothing so far.

362
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,110
让你的人留在原地 
Keep your men back,

363
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,990
在每扇窗户和每个出口 布置好遥控飞机和侧位仪
but I want drones and spotters on every window and exit.

364
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,890
我要知道我的人现在怎么样了
I want to know what's happening with my men.

365
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,230
好的 没问题 长官
Yeah, you got it, Captain.

366
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,570
我不可能拿到裂变触发器
There's no way I can get a fission igniter.

367
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,540
如果有种方法能在给足他们要求的同时
What if there was a way to give them what they wanted

368
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,780
还能拖住他们呢
and stall them at the same time?

369
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,050
你有什么主意
What have you got?

370
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
我可以做一个假的
I could build a replica.

371
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,850
万一他们认出来了呢
What if they can spot a fake?

372
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,720
我做的可以通过扫描
I can make one that will pass a scan.

373
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,560
但如果他们检查出来了 或者直接就用了
If they test it out or try and use it immediately,

374
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,750
那我们就都完了
then we're out of luck.

375
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,790
我们可以冒这个险
That's risk we'll have to take.

376
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,930
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

377
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,800
- 长官 - 怎么了
- Captain?  - Yep?

378
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,770
卢卡斯・文森特是神圣开拓军队的高级特务
Lucas Vincent... he's a high-level operative in the Holy Reclamation Army,

379
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,250
那是一个分散式的恐怖组织
a decentralized network of terrorist cells

380
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,180
具有反西方倾向 有劫持人质的记录
with anti-Western bias and a history of hostage taking,

381
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,080
没有人质有好下场
none of them ending well.

382
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,420
去年八月他们劫持了东京附近的大使馆
Last August they took over an embassy near Tokyo.

383
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,680
使用相同的手段 强行闯入
Same MO... they enter with force,

384
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,850
引起媒体和执法机关的注意
drew the attention of the media and law enforcement

385
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,220
通过挟持人质达到他们的目的
using human hostages as collateral for their demands.

386
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,340
然后呢 
What happened?

387
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,060
他们帮助他们的人逃出了监狱
They facilitated the release of several of their comrades.

388
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,190
只要得到他们想要的 他们就会放人
Once they got what they wanted, they released the hostages.

389
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,590
但是他们不害怕杀人
But they're not afraid to take lives...

390
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,290
包括自己的命
including their own.

391
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,680
你知道么 每个人都会被楼梯绊倒
You know, everyone trips on stairs,

392
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,910
经统计大概每上2222个阶梯就发生一回
and it's calculated to occur in one in every 2,222 occasions.

393
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,680
真有趣
That's very interesting.

394
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,980
- 你知道什么才是更有趣的么 约翰 - 什么
- You know what would be interesting, John? - What?

395
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,610
就是你再给我讲一遍冰钓的故事
If you told me that ice fishing story again.

396
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,350
如果你想保持身材 我们可以每周末都去做越障训练
If you want to get in shape, we can run the O-course every weekend.

397
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,090
喔 真的能么
O-can we?

398
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,550
分头行动
Let's split up.

399
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,650
多利安 你还好么
Dorian, you okay?

400
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,290
约翰 快过来
John, get over here.

401
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,100
这层没人了
Floor's clear.

402
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,430
你还好么
You okay?

403
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,190
你脑袋破了
You took one to the head.

404
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,570
没错 被弹回来的子弹打到了
Yeah, ricochet.

405
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,620
你找到什么了
Whatcha got?

406
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,100
我也不确定
I'm not sure.

407
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,540
但是这上写了字
But there's writing on it.

408
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,510
"开始"
"Start."

409
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,210
- 开始 - 开始
- Start? - Start.

410
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,910
你查出他的身份了么
You I.D.'d him?

411
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,080
他叫迈克尔・多纳瑞
His name is Michael Demerais.

412
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,250
他是神圣开拓军队的一员
He's a member of the Holy Reclamation Army.

413
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
这就是幕后黑手
So they're behind this.

414
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,520
也许不是
Maybe not.

415
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,600
这是个变脸器
It's a facemaker.

416
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,940
所以 这人是谁
So who's this guy?

417
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,540
他叫格雷戈・斯通
His name is Gregor Stone.

418
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,380
他有持枪抢劫的案底
He has a few priors for armed robbery.

419
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,820
他们为什么要装成激进组织的成员
Why would they impersonate members of a radical organization?

420
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,380
怎么了
What's wrong?

421
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,320
我的动态电压调节被子弹摧毁了
My dynamic voltage scaling has been damaged by the bullet.

422
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,860
你能说的简单一点么
You want to say that a little less complicated?

423
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,400
五分钟后我将不能走路
I won't be able to walk in five minutes.

424
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,160
我们的飞机呢
Where are our v-tols?

425
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,760
我正在努力
I'm working on it.

426
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,000
根据它发出的信号的频率
Based on the frequency at which these transmit...

427
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,770
我测出这楼里有七个变脸人
I detect seven facemakers in the building.

428
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,200
如果想隐藏他们的身份
If they hide their identities,

429
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,070
带个面具不是更方便
why not just wear a mask?

430
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,350
为什么要伪装成别人
Why pretend to be something else?

431
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,100
这个问题问的好
That's a good question.

432
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,410
好了
All right.

433
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,770
让我来试试修修你
Let's try and fix you.

434
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,510
伤口看起来怎么样
How does it look?

435
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,650
没什么大碍
Yeah, it's, uh, totally fine.

436
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,140
几乎都看不到它
You can hardly see it.

437
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,320
好吧
Okay.

438
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,820
那我要怎么做
So, what do I do?

439
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,150
有一条品红色的肌腱
All right, there's a magenta colored tendon.

440
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,860
我需要你切掉它
I need you to cut it.

441
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,920
等下 这...这东西干净吗
All right, is... is that thing clean?

442
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,320
当然干净
Of course it is.

443
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,220
你确定吗
Are you sure?

444
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,460
确定
Positive.

445
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,460

- I said magenta. That was lavender. - The hell's magenta?

这东西不能进入我的脑袋
That's not going inside of my head.

453
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,390
- 我是你的搭档 相信我 - 如果鲁迪在这
- I'm your partner, trust me. - If Rudy were here,

454

他肯定对你有很大的意见
he'd have a really big issue with you right now.

完美是不能计时的
You can't put a clock on perfection.

Clearly someone was rushing when they designed your manners chip.

464

调更多的人去楼梯间

约翰 他们知道你在这楼里
John, they know you're in the building.

511
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,610
你怎么进的来呢

我对你很失望啊 马尔多纳多队长

我还以为我们处的很好

516
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,660
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

517
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,600
我说撤掉条子
I said no cops.

518
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,040
我已经召回了我的人
I pulled my men back.

519
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,080
我的人都在大楼外面 疏散人群
The only people I have there are conducting the evacuation, outside the building.

520
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,110
那你怎么解释我的人刚在楼下杀了两个警察
Then how do you explain the two cops my men just killed downstairs?

521
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,920
他在唬人
He's bluffing.

522
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,430
我不知道你杀了什么人
I don't know what men you killed,

523
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,230
但他们不是我的人
but they weren't mine.

524
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
我们有约在先
We made a deal.

525
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,710
我给你想要的条件 没有人会死
I get you what you want, no one else dies.

526
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,940
我什么时候能拿到我的裂变触发器
When do I get my fission ignitor?

527
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,220
已经在路上了 十分钟以内到
It's on its way, ten minutes or less.

528
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,190
很好 多一分钟你就会在人行道上多看到一具尸体
Great. Every minute longer is another body you'll be scraping off the pavement.

529
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,170
闭上你的嘴
Keep your mouth shut.

530
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,800
约翰
John?

531
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,800
我要出去
I'm going out there.

532
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,000
我不能让詹娜一个人面对
I can't leave Jenna alone.

533
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,730
佩吉 那是个不明智的做法
Paige, that's a bad idea.

534
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,670
我必须那么做
I have to. I have to.

535
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,030
我们再有几层楼就到了
We're a few floors away.

536
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,500
她需要我
She needs me.

537
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,140
我需要她
I need her.

538
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:57,180
如果我们会死...我也要和她在一起
If we're gonna die... ...I want to be with her.

539
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,250
她是我妹妹
She's my sister.

540
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,780
现在是我唯一可以混进人群里的机会
Now is my only chance to blend in

541
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,210
而他们不会发现我
without anyone seeing me.

542
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,020
佩吉 呆在那别动
Paige, just stay where you are.

543
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,320
我会开着机
I'll leave my phone open.

544
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,020
你会听到我们的对话
You'll be able to hear what's going on.

545
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,190
佩吉 太冒险了
Paige, it's too risky.

546
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,990
听着 别动
Listen to me, just stay put.

547
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,390
我必须这样做
I have to.

548
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,190
- 我必须这样做 - 佩吉 拜托了
- I have to. - Paige, please,

549
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,120
佩吉 听我的 佩吉

550
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,170
佩吉 你在听吗 佩吉

舆洗室

562
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,060

我要去下洗手间
I have to go to the bathroom.

564
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,970
你想要我尿在地上 是么

遥控飞机到了
The drone's coming.

569
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,750
通话中

570
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,190
卢卡斯 我们有约在先

等我们放了人质我会通知你的
I'll let you know how we're gonna release the hostages.

575
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,240
希望能骗过他们
Let's hope they buy it.

576
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,140
现在把这个消息发给其他人

577

是时候结束这场战争了
It's time to wind this up.

579

580
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,010
或许还有更多他们的人在这栋楼里
Maybe there are more of them in the building.

581
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,810
- 或许他们在楼外面 - 但干扰器还开着
- Maybe they're outside the building. - But the jammer's still on.

582
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,620
除非他们有人在外面 不然他们不可能和别人通话
If they have people outside, they wouldn't be able to talk to each other.

除非他们用别的通话方式
Unless they were talking some other way.

584

开始
"Start."

585
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,440
他们肯定是用它来和某人近距离的在大楼里进行
They must be using it as some sort of point-to-point communication

586
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,210
某种点对点的通讯 
with someone in proximity of the building.

587
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,450
佩吉说那个头目
Paige said the man in charge...

588
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,280
一直走到窗边
kept going to the window.

589
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,470
我没想到他们能搞来这个
I didn't think they'd come through.

590
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,330
如果这是追踪装置呢
What if there's a tracking device?

591
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,270
反正我们不带走它
We're not taking it anyway.

592
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,210
没关系
It doesn't matter.

593
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,610
他不想要那个装置 说不通啊
He doesn't want the tech. That doesn't make sense.

594
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,920
为什么挟持人质然后和我们要一个不想带走的装置
Why take hostages and negotiate for tech you don't want?

595
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,660
或许这是调虎离山
Maybe it's a diversion.

596
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,630
对啊 但为了什么
Yeah, but for what?

597
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,270
在临近建筑物里有什么
Are there any targets

598
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,370
更有价值的目标是他们想要的么
of value in the adjacent buildings?

599
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,210
唯一有价值的目标就是
The only target of any value is

600
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,380
专门研究钯的重金属称重站了
a precious metal weigh station specializing in palladium.

601
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,420
他们想抢劫
It's a heist.

602
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,390
钯 那就值得他们做这么多了
Palladium. That would make all this worthwhile.

603
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,180
包起来
Wrap it up.

604
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,680
我们只有十分钟
We're out of here in ten.

605
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,450
丹尼尔 坚持住
Hang in there, Daniel.

606
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,470
当这结束后 我们就已经在某处的海滩上了
When this is over, we'll all be on a beach somewhere,

607
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,210
你也会完好如初的
you'll be as good as new.

608
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,550
我需要医生
I need a doctor.

609
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,610
马上就有
Soon.

610
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,630
那个哔哔声是什么
What's that beeping?

611
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,860
你和其他人带上三个人质
You and the guys pick three hostages.

612
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,110
为什么
Why?

613
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,940
以防万一
We may need insurance.

614
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,750
收好东西
Let's pack it up.

615
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,410
约翰 他们激活了一个光弹
John, they've activated a light bomb.

616
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,590
他们想要灭口
They're gonna kill the hostages.

617
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,740
- 你要干嘛 - 按原计划 我们上楼
- What are you doing? - Sticking to the plan. We're going up.

618
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,870
约翰 他们知道我们在这
John, they know we're here.

619
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,380
他们也会料到我们会上楼
They're expecting us to come up the stairs.

620
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,120
我们不可能活着走到二十五楼的
We won't make it to the 25th floor alive.

621
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,490
他说的你也都听到了
You heard him.

622
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,030
我们没有其他选择
We have no choice.

623
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,230
是我没得选择
I don't have a choice.

624
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,730
人质命悬一线
People's lives are in jeopardy.

625
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,750
你中枪了 脑子里又塞了口香糖
You've been shot. Your head's full of bubble gum.

626
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,340
你不能一个人去冒险
You can't do this alone.

627
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,940
我必须去
I have to.

628
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,740
那我跟你去
Then I'm coming with you.

629
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,940
你不能去
You can't.

630
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,980
我被设计来做这些的 约翰
I'm designed to do this, John.

631
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,090
时间到了
It's time.

632
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,750
詹娜
Jenna...

633
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,420
何不能跟我一起来呢
why don't you come with me.

634
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,590
不要 不准碰她
No, no, no. Don't you touch her.

635
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,130
别碰她 把我带走吧
Don't you touch her. Take me!

636
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,900
放她走 不然我干掉你
Let her go! I will shoot you!

637
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,840
不 把我带走吧 不 放开那女孩
No, no! Take me! No, leave her!

638
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,930
把我带走吧 拜托了
Take me! Please! Me!

639
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,480
警察 快趴下
Police! Get down!

640
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,030
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

641
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,910
我从来不杀我不认识的人
I've never killed a man I didn't know.

642
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,310
但是
But then again...

643
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,470
你不是人类
you're not a man.

644
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,090
不是吗
Are you?

645
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,350
你终于出现了 格雷戈
Nice of you to show up, Gregor.

646
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,750
你到底去哪了
Where the hell have you been?

647
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,950
我们以为你挂了
We thought you were dead.

648
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,900
马尔多纳多
Maldonado?

649
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,970
- 约翰 - 人质安全了
- John? - The hostages are secure.

650
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,770
他们是来抢钯的
The whole thing is a palladium heist.

651
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,870
把它关掉 就现在
Shut it off... now!

652
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,930
他们利用我们关闭了整个警报系统
They got us to block the alarm system.

653
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,500
把干扰器关掉
Turn the jammer off!

654
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,770
保罗探员 马上把干扰器关掉
Detective Paul, turn off the jammer now!

655
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,580
关掉它
Shut it off.

656
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,690
走吧
Let's go.

657
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,440
谢啦
Thank you.

658
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,850
约翰
John?

659
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,690
你一定是佩吉
You must be Paige.

660
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,890
谢谢
Thank you.

661
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,560
没呢 谢谢你
No. Thank you.

662
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,100
你很勇敢
You were very brave.

663
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,300
你今天帮忙救了不少人
You helped save a lot of lives today.

664
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,340
你的搭档在哪呢
Where's your partner?

665
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,010
他在...
Oh, he's, uh...

666
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,150
他在进行修补
he's getting patched up.

667
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,710
约翰 这是我妹妹
John, this is my sister.

668
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,480
这是詹娜
This is Jenna.

669
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,580
詹娜 很高兴认识你
Jenna, it's a pleasure to meet you.

670
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,180
我听了很多关于你的故事
I've heard a lot about you.

671
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,380
你没事太好啦
I'm glad you're okay.

672
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,950
谢啦
Thanks.

673
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,860
我得到一些有关犯人的情报
I've got some intel on the perps.

674
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,260
这一切的幕后黑手是杰拉德・雷顿
Guy behind it all was Gerald Leighton.

675
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,890
他和他的团伙跟过去两年四起大型抢劫案都有关系
We linked him and his men to four high-value robberies in the last two years.

676
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,260
他们用警方的干扰器来抢劫钯
Using police jamming protocol to initiate a palladium heist.

677
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,770
这群贼可够聪明的
Pretty elaborate for a bunch of thieves.

678
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,470
要搞定这些文书工作可麻烦了
It's going to be a paperwork nightmare.

679
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,470
我还以为你过来是感谢我呢
And I thought you had come down here to thank me.

680
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,200
为什么 因为你履行了你的职责
For what? Doing your job?

681
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,140
申明一下
Just for the record,

682
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,640
我可是提醒过你从那栋楼里出来 对吧
I did tell you to get out of the building, right?

683
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,140
我发誓 我什么也没听到
I swear, all I heard was static.

684
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,710
我要跟你商量个事呢 警探
Oi! I've got a bone to pick with you, Detective.

685
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,490
口香糖 真的假的
Chewing gum? Really?

686
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,490
你能用口香糖修好赛车吗
Would you fix a race car with chewing gum?

687
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,550
是啊 如果它坏了而我还得赢下比赛
Uh, yeah, if it was busted, and I need to win a race.

688
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,390
他需要做个全面检查
He'll need extensive diagnostics.

689
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,920
这个不着急
Ah, that can wait.

690
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,260
来吧 我们去吃面
Come on, let's go get some noodles.

691
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,630
你应该明白我不吃东西
You are aware that I don't eat.

692
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,900
太好了 我买单 走吧
Perfect. I'm buying. Let's roll.

693
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
那我就在这等吧 怎么样
Well, I'll just wait here, shall I?

694
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,030
谢谢你回来救我
Thank you for what you did back there.

695
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,770
别客气
Don't mention it.

696
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,080
再说 没人可以动我的咖啡加热机
Besides, no one messes with my coffee warmer.

697
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,860
嘿 约翰 你还记得你跟佩吉说的那个故事
Hey, John, you know that story you told Paige,

698
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,450
你小时候掉到冰湖里去的那个
when you fell through the ice as a kid?

699
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,130
当有枪指在我头上的时候 我有相同的感觉
When that gun was pointed at my head, I felt something similar.

700
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,000
我不想死
I-I didn't want to die.

701
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,080
我知道死对于我来说不一样 但是...
I know it's not the same with me, but...

702
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,250
嘿 死了就死了
Hey, dead is dead.

703
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,720
是啊
Yeah.

704
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,430
我想也是
I suppose so.

705
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,980
为什么不放点歌听呢
Why don't you chuck some music on?

706
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,520
艾尔顿・约翰
Eldon John, hah?

707
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,360
你都听到了 对不
You heard it, didn't you?

708
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,800
本尼和乐队
Buh-buh-buh Bennie and the Jets

709
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,750
本尼和乐队
Bennie and the Jets

710
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,710
别唱了 拜托
Don't. Don't. Please, don't do that.

711
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,850
说什么都没用 雷金纳德
Whatever you say, Reginald.

712
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,090
本尼
Bennie

713
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,960
