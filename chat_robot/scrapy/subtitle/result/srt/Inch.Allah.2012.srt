我沒看到
I didn't see anything.

144
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,680
你沒有看到任何武器嗎?
You didn't see any weapons?

145
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,846
不,我沒看見任何武器
No, I didn't see any weapons.

146
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:41,223
你喜歡看到移民區被攻擊嗎?
Are you glad the settlement was attacked?

147
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,199
妳還好嗎?
You OK'?

148
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:13,882
發生什麼事?
What's going on?

149
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,159
我不能說
I can't talk.

150
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,730
今晚我再去看妳
I'll see you tonight.

151
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,915
那個人說他不要給我看他的報告
The man says he won't show me his papers.

152
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,777
不是他根本沒有報告,
Not that he doesn't have them,

153
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:48,721
只是他不要把報告給我看
just that he doesn't want to show them to me.

154
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,888
所以...
So...

155
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,033
我想辦法冷靜下來,你知道的,
I try to stay calm, you know,

156
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,761
只要跟他講我只是做好份內的事,
just explain to him that I'm only doing my job,

157
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:05,907
攻擊之後,我不能讓他繼續那樣了
that after the attack, I can't let him through like that.

158
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,207
所以然後,札克...你認識札克嗎?
So then, Zach... You know Zach?

159
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:14,610
他問我是不是有問題
He asks me if there's a problem.

160
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:20,055
我說沒有,我可以處理
I say no, I can handle it.

161
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:24,325
但他根本不聽,就開始大吼大叫
But he doesn't listen. He starts to shout.

162
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,466
他極其暴怒
He went apeshit!

163
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,072
他要贏
He wanted to win.

164
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,813
他開始聚眾
He started to round up all the men.

165
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,417
他把他們帶到那裏
He kept them there

166
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,652
圍住他...
near him...

167
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,922
赤膊
half naked.

168
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,828
我都不能說什麼
I didn't say anything.

169
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,167
我把嘴巴閉得緊緊的
I kept my mouth shut.

170
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,441
我討厭做控管邊界的工作
I hate doing border control.

171
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:22,644
我比較喜歡坐在辦公室裏,或其他地方
I'd rather be in an office, or anywhere else.

172
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,014
我討厭哨站的責任
I hate checkpoint duty.

173
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,855
辭掉呀!
Quit your job.

174
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,189
這不是我的工作,克洛伊
It's not my job, Chloé.

175
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:40,198
我沒得選
I have no choice.

176
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:47,037
你很清楚事情沒那麼簡單
You know very well it's not that simple.

177
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:27,741
如果我的手機關機,你可以到醫院找我
You can reach me at the hospital if my mobile's off.

178
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:50,438
瑪利安,不要碰那張床。移民者在那上面辦事
Leave the bed, Mariam.The settlers fucked in it.

179
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:54,232
你他媽的聾了?我叫妳走開!
Did your mother make you deaf? Leave it!

180
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:57,975
卡里姆,你作軟塑膠的分類
Karim, you separate the soft plastic.

181
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,982
快點!你們這群懶鬼!
Hurry up, you bunch of slugs!

182
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,550
大家過來看看這個!
Guys, come see this!

183
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,821
看一下!
Take a look!

184
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:00,875
不,一切都很好
No, everything's fine.

185
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,702
不,今天沒有搜查
No, no search today.

186
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:06,344
我不行,麥克,已經打包了
I can't, Michaël. It's packed.

187
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,808
不,都很平靜
No, things are quiet.

188
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:16,784
沒問題,好,我可以理解
OK, fine. I understand.

189
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,286
要多久?
For how long?

190
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,461
白癡!
Idiot.

191
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,332
-對不起,我們要關門了! -為什麼?
- Sorry, we're closing. - Why?

192
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,514
診所關了
The clinic is closed.

193
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,509
薩菲!
Safi!

194
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:46,486
烈士是上帝所愛的人
The martyr is beloved by God!

195
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:58,305
你的血不會白流的!
Your blood won't flow in vain!

196
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,987
是的,媽!
Yes, Mom.

197
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,933
我就在樓上
I'm just upstairs.

198
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,368
好,我馬上下樓
Yeah, I'll be down soon.

199
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,030
你看起來累慘了
You look worn out.

200
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:00,569
只是缺乏睡眠罷了!
Lack of sleep, that's all.

201
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:04,800
有什麼不對勁嗎?
Is anything wrong?

202
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,674
都很好,媽,沒什麼大不了的
It's OK, Mom. No big deal.

203
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,680
妳約在什麼時候?
What time's your date?

204
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:14,082
還要一陣子
A bit later.

205
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:20,417
如果看起來一切正常要告訴我,好嗎?
Tell me if these look alright, OK?

206
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:23,154
這個呢?
These ones?

207
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,828
媽...
Mom...

208
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,830
站後面一點,我看不見!
stand back, I can't see!

209
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:32,230
喜歡嗎?
Like this?

210
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,769
我不知道，你沒有...
I don't know. Don't you have...

211
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,698
你知道，漂亮的是...
You know, the pretty ones...

212
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:41,043
圓的那對，比那些大的那對
The round ones, bigger than those.

213
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,839
-圓的? -是呀!
- The round ones? - Yeah.

214
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:46,575
木製的嗎?等一下,我找找
The wooden ones? Wait, I'll get them.

215
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:24,554
這對嗎?是嗎?
These ones? Right?

216
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:33,657
我知道這個表情，怎麼了？
I know that look. What's wrong?

217
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:39,167
就是這對，你真的很漂亮，媽！
Those are the ones. You're really pretty, Mom.

218
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,301
是嗎？
Yeah?

219
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,643
看著我，克洛伊
Look at me, Chloé.

220
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:58,510
妳總是杞人憂天
You always worry for nothing.

221
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:01,123
妳不要告訴我
You don't talk to me.

222
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,026
沒什麼好說的
I've got nothing to say.

223
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,925
媽媽？
Mom?

224
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,761
我只想看看那條河
I just want to see the river.

225
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,870
等一下
Wait.

226
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,113
那裏
There.

227
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:25,771
帶上妳的泳衣和防曬乳液
Bring along your swimsuit and sunscreen.

228
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:28,104
是到海邊的好日子
It's a great day for the beach.

229
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:31,840
一小時後，我們有更多的氣象。接下來，是今天的新聞。
We'll have more weather in an hour. Up next, it's the news.

230
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,910
在貝特舒姆龍猶太移民區的那起攻擊事件
The attack on the Jewish settlement in Beit Shomron

231
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,351
仍然還沒得到證實
is still unclaimed.

232
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:42,186
武裝部隊已經在拉姆安拉附近
For several days, the army has been carrying out

233
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,191
舉行很多天的大規模演習
a vast operation around Ramallah,

234
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:49,391
主要是在恐怖份子可能躲藏的難民營裏
mainly in the refugee camps where the terrorists might be hiding.

235
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:52,224
妳還好嗎?
You OK'?

236
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:56,802
- 今天妳不要工作嗎？ - 我正在聽！
- You're not working today? - I'm listening!

237
00:36:56,928 --> 00:37:01,638
在亞實基倫，市議會同意要建
In Ashkelon, the municipal council approved construction

238
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:03,473
一間新的圖書館...
of a new library...

239
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,276
兩人受傷而且他們徹底搜查了難民營，沒人死亡！
Two wounded and they ransack the camp. Nobody died!

240
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:09,817
再想想辦法
Not for lack of trying.

241
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:23,898
另外一邊死了一個男孩，但沒人作任何評論
A boy dies on the other side, no one says anything.

242
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,762
他們在殖民地封鎖了攻擊的消息
They cover the attack on the colony.

243
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:30,971
這是他們的新聞，他們的工作
That's the news for them. That's their job.

244
00:37:32,564 --> 00:37:36,102
一個男孩被卡車撞死，對你們以色列人來說，不是那麼重要
A boy crushed by a truck isn't important enough for you Israelis.

245
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:39,640
"我們以色列人"
"Us Israelis?"

246
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,157
有兩人受重傷
Two people were seriously wounded.

247
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,456
今晚可以看到妳嗎？
See you tonight?

248
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:55,360
不，我要值兩班，回來已經晚了
No, I have a double shift.　I'll be back late.

249
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:58,660
有可能不會再回來了，如果他們要在哨站上搞點什麼的話
Or maybe never, if they try something at the checkpoint.

250
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:01,799
愛娃...
Ava...

251
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:06,667
給妳，蘭德那裏拿的
Here, from Rand.

252
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:09,634

Who?

253
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:28,827
嗨！白人女孩
Hey, white girl.

254
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,790
在這個爛地方你比我們好不到那去
You're no better than us in this shit.

255
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:37,237
妳無法改變什麼的，瞭解嗎？
You couldn't have done anything different, understand?

256
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,715
妳正在做什麼？
What are you doing?

257
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:55,180
快點，那個給我，把它給我！
Come on, give me that. Give it to me!

258
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,842
-你要去那裏？ -上車
- Where you going? - Get in.

259
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,484
這些也要

260
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:17,299
-我的朋友! -阿曼德,還好嗎?
- My friend! - lmad, what's up?

261
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:56,818
阿曼德

262
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,280
到這裏來!
Come here!

263
00:44:58,409 --> 00:44:59,683
我們走
Let's go.

264
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,313
他帶他的醫生來給我們看
He's showing off his doctor!

265
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,861
你好嗎?
How are you?

266
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:23,435
你開了整個難民營裏最好的車子
You drive the nicest car in the whole camp!

267
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:25,844
而且他還假裝不認得我們
And he pretends not to know us.

268
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,348
他現在變成導遊了！
He's become a tourist guide!

269
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,285
他的車子閃亮閃亮的，不可能再更亮了
His car's shiny, shiny. Couldn't get any shinier.

270
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:40,291
這可能對我們有用唷！
It might be useful to us.

271
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,988
可能對我們會有幫助
It could help us out.

272
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,156
可能非常有幫助
It could be very helpful.

273
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:50,670
不再多喝點茶嗎？
Have some more tea!

274
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:52,331
明天見，我的朋友！
See you tomorrow, my friend!

275
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:55,239
-別生病了! -或輪胎沒氣
- Don't get sick!　- Or have a flat!

276
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:25,453
嗨!阿曼德
Hi, lmad.

277
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,718
好呀!你可以過來
OK, you can come over.

278
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:37,527
拜!
Bye.

279
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,366
克洛伊，我要告訴妳
Chloé, I have to talk to you.

280
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:48,909
等一下
Two seconds.

281
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:03,454
怎麼了？
What's up?

282
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:05,225
這是什麼？
What's this?

283
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:09,625
我不能把它們丟掉
I couldn't throw them out.

284
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:12,825
好極了！你自己去貼海報的嗎？
Bravo! Did you paste them yourself?

285
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:16,801
-聽著，我在那... -妳正在搞什麼?
- Look, I was there... - What the hell are you doing?

286
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,339
妳不能只做份內的工作就好
You can't just do as you please here.

287
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:21,136
我是個醫生，能置身事外嗎？
I'm a doctor, stay out of it?

288
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:22,744
是呀！完全正確！
Exactly, yeah.

289
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:26,614
克洛伊正在忙！
Chloé's busy!

290
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,919
今天是薩菲的生日！
It's Safi's birthday!

291
00:50:31,008 --> 00:50:32,282
蘭德！
Rand!

292
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,954
這裏還有點規矩，妳知道的！
There are rules here. You know that.

293
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:39,022
妳不能隨心所欲，為所欲為
You can't do anything you want.

294
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:42,028
妳要冷靜一點，做好自己的工作
You have to keep a cool head, do your work.

295
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:47,029
他的血就在我的鞋子上
His blood was on my shoes.

296
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:54,869
是呀！下一次你要做什麼？
Yeah? What'll you do next time?

297
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:57,039
別擔心！
Don't worry.

298
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,612
妳還有嗎？
Do you have any more?

299
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:03,045
把那些丟到垃圾桶裏
Throw those in the garbage.

300
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,674
他叫什麼？
What was his name again?

301
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:29,371
約瑟夫
Youssef.

302
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:32,177
他是個小傻子
He was a little dork.

303
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:33,804
小什麼？
A little what?

304
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:35,474
小笨蛋！
A little punk!

305
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:41,919
嗨，小可愛！
Hi there, darling!

306
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:00,094
-你有鑰匙嗎？　-有!
- Do you have your keys? - Yes.

307
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:02,500
因為過完週末妳要自己開門
Because you open up after the weekend.

308
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,435
-我可以載妳一程？ -不，我自己用走的
- Can I give you a lift? - No, I'll walk.

309
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,133
-確定？　-是呀!
- Sure?　- Yeah.

310
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,528
克洛伊 ！
Chloé!

311
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,771
妳看見那顆星嗎？
You see that star?

312
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:48,072
最亮的那顆？
The brightest one?

313
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,937
事實上，它不是一顆星
It's not a star, in fact.

314
00:54:52,502 --> 00:54:54,778
那是以色列的控制塔
It's an Israeli control tower.

315
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:57,381
他們在每個地方監視我們
They spy on us everywhere.

316
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:22,330
他是巴基斯坦人
He's Palestinian!

317
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,299
他進了準決賽
He's in the semifinals.

318
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:43,107
-妳好嗎？ -很好！
- How are you? - Good.

319
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:50,311
-忙嗎？ -普通
- Busy day? - The usual.

320
00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:04,865
你有身份證嗎？
Do you have ID?

321
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,859
你打哪來?
Where are you from?

322
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,769
放下你的香煙！
Put out your cigarette!

323
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:53,871
就在這個村子?不再更遠?
Just to the village?  No farther?

324
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,811
對，我們會在入夜前回來
Yes. We'll be back before nightfall.

325
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:03,357
看看我能做什麼
I'll see what I can do.

326
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:12,026
我相信妳
I'm trusting you.

327
01:00:13,256 --> 01:00:14,997
晚安！
Good night.

328
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:33,581
-八個小時 -是呀！
- Eight hours. - Yes.

329
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,314
不能再多
No more.

330
01:00:36,947 --> 01:00:38,449
謝啦！
Thanks.

331
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,616
妳確定嗎？
Are you sure?

332
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:44,687
我不知道我們在哪？全都是希伯來文
I don't know where we are. It's all in Hebrew.

333
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:46,953
這裏！
Here!

334
01:01:49,185 --> 01:01:50,493
絕不！
No way.

335
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,395
-這裏！ -閉嘴!
- Here! - Shut up!

336
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,730
這裏是我們以前吃東西的地方
This is where we used to eat.

337
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:37,604
媽!爸!
Mom, Dad,

338
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:41,447
艾哈邁德、鮑娜
Ahmed, Fauna,

339
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:45,276
歐瑪和瑪利亞
Omar and Mariam.

340
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,412
和妳?
And you?

341
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:51,926
我坐在媽媽旁邊
I sat next to Mom.

342
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:01,194
浴室在這裏
The bathroom was here.

343
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:33,298
把石頭放下來
Leave the rocks alone!

344
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:36,893
你要把整個聖地都裝到你的袋子裏去嗎？你這個白癡!
You put the entire Holy Land in your bag, you nut!

345
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:38,472
別管他
Leave him be.

346
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,109
謝謝!謝謝!
Thank you, thank you!

347
01:03:53,243 --> 01:03:56,986
好了！我們走吧！
OK, let's go.

348
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:01,427
你有什麼問題？
What's your problem?

349
01:04:02,685 --> 01:04:04,824
妳認為妳很偉大嗎？
You think you're so great, huh?

350
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:10,866
為什麼妳就是要帶我們到這來？
Why did you bring us here anyway?

351
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:15,440
妳是不是有什麼不能取代的東西被偷了嗎？
Have you ever had something stolen that you can't replace?

352
01:04:19,335 --> 01:04:21,941
妳喜歡這種只能看，不能碰的東西嗎？
Would you like to see it, but not be able to touch it?

353
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:28,381
所以，妳現在感覺好一點了嗎？媽？
So, do you feel better now, Mom?

354
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:32,057
幫妳想起妳所失去的，這樣很爽嗎？是不是？
Helps you remember what you've lost. Great, huh?

355
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:35,823
妳可以告訴妳兒子，我們有多麼失敗，真棒！
You? You can tell your son what losers we are. Super!

356
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:54,380
我要留在這裏，我喜歡在這，其他人也是
I'm staying. I like being here.　The others too.

357
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:59,680
你不可能快樂的，那是你的問題
You can never be happy, that's your problem.

358
01:05:01,177 --> 01:05:02,679
看！
Look.

359
01:05:03,313 --> 01:05:07,056
我們拿到的特別許可證，得要感謝妳那個白人朋友
The special authorization we got thanks to your white friend.

360
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:11,764
看一看！
Look at it!

361
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:16,264
我們要那個東西才能回到自己的村子
We need that to visit our own village.

362
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,365
妳媽的出生的
Your mother's birthplace.

363
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:23,739
讓妳很快樂，那才是問題！
It makes you happy. That's the problem.

364
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:29,777
妳想錯了！
You thought wrong.

365
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:29,408
-一切都順利吧？ -是呀！
- Did it go alright? - Yeah.

366
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:32,810
-妳把他們都帶回來了？ -是呀！別擔心！
- You brought them all back? - Yeah, don't worry.

367
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:35,773
我和艾塔瑪談過了，他正要去特拉維夫
I spoke to ltamar. He's going to Tel Aviv.

368
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:39,278
不，不是我
No. Not me.

369
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:41,686
不是今晚
Not tonight.

370
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:20,222
我好累
I'm so tired.

371
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:24,721
什麼？
What?

372
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:27,828
這不是妳的戰爭
It's not your war.

373
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:36,334
我這裏沒有很多
We don't have much here.

374
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:40,810
但我們正在受苦
But we're suffering.

375
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:45,553
至少讓我們擁有那個
Let us have that, at least.

376
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:49,856
妳不能在這裏只出現一下子而已
You can't just turn up here

377
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,320
而是要和我們像那樣玩玩！
and play around with our shit like that.

378
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,652
它不是妳的
It's not yours.

379
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:25,169
請到阿哈亞醫院！
The Al Hayat hospital, please!

380
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:30,744
我不能再靠近了，到處都是哨站
I can get you close, but there are checkpoints everywhere.

381
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:33,251
我發誓，他們都像獵犬一樣
I swear, they're like hunting dogs.

382
01:10:33,376 --> 01:10:36,016
他們在營區裏追踪到一支運動人士的手機
They targeted an activist cell in the camp.

383
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:38,887
他們正在找任何可疑的東西
They're searching everything.

384
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:57,606
我必須在這裏停下來
I have to stop here.

385
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:00,009
妳用走的比較快
You'll be faster on foot anyway.

386
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,475
我妹要生了，我一定要到醫院裏去
My sister's in labor. We have to get to the hospital.

387
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:34,871
拜託！
Please.

388
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:37,543
我也不要在這裏
I don't want to be here either.

389
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,551
我也寧願到別的地方去
I'd rather be somewhere else too.

390
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:44,250
她不能從哨站轉送過去！
She can't deliver at the checkpoint!

391
01:11:45,381 --> 01:11:47,088
今天那一隊上場打球？
Who's playing today?

392
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:48,889
巴賽隆納
Barcelona.

393
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:51,795
巴賽隆納正在打？　你是巴賽隆納的粉絲嗎？
Barcelona's playing? Are you a Barcelona fan?

394
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:54,629
我也是！
Me too!

395
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:03,437
米卡要出來了！
Mika's coming!

396
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:10,117
八公分了！
Eight centimeters.

397
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:12,076
流太多血了！
Too much blood.

398
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:19,125
你最喜歡那個球員？
Who's your favorite player?

399
01:12:19,248 --> 01:12:20,921
我最喜歡普悠兒
Me, it's Puyol.

400
01:12:22,752 --> 01:12:24,857
世上最好的防守球員
Best defender in the world.

401
01:12:26,088 --> 01:12:28,864
他從未失分
He never scores.

402
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:33,466
他防守到自己倒地，拜託，老兄！
He defends till he drops. Please, man!

403
01:12:33,996 --> 01:12:36,374
我妹妹不能在這裏生孩子
My sister can't give birth here.

404
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:40,207
拜託！
Please.

405
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:27,889
那是妳家的屁事！
What's your fucking problem?

406
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:54,179
-克洛伊，待在我身邊　-我不會離開妳的
- Chloé, stay with me! - I won't leave you.

407
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:58,354
走
Go.

408
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:02,452
-妳可以嗎？　-可以，你走吧！
- Will you be OK? - Yeah, you go.

409
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,346
好，他準備好了！
OK, he's ready.

410
01:15:13,656 --> 01:15:15,602
就是這樣，繼續！
That's it, keep going!

411
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:16,999
就是這樣
That's it!

412
01:15:23,532 --> 01:15:25,307
用力！用力！用力！
Push, push, push!

413
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:33,040
讓出通路！
Clear the way!

414
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:37,444
讓她過！
Let her through!

415
01:18:56,879 --> 01:18:58,654
你現在可以走了
You can leave now.

416
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:31,220
沒時間了
There's no time.

417
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:34,759
如果他們還有人在另外一邊，我可以讓它過來
If they have someone on the other side, I can get it through.

418
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:37,292
為什麼？我要這樣！
Why? I want to do it!

419
01:21:18,053 --> 01:21:19,327
嗨！
Hi.

420
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:20,866
門關起來
Shut the door.

421
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,546
我有消息要給蘭德
I have news for Rand.

422
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:09,379
我從法院那裏接到一通電話
I got a call from the court.

423
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:13,078
柴德被求處二十五年徒刑
Ziad was sentenced to 25 years.

424
01:22:49,444 --> 01:22:53,586
小老鼠，小老鼠，妳失去了妳的寶貝
Little rat, little rat, you've lost your babies

425
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:57,528
妳在這裏已經一無所有了，小老鼠，小老鼠！
There's nothing for you here, little rat, little rat!

426
01:22:57,653 --> 01:23:01,260
-找妳的寶貝,蘭德? -或是妳丈夫呢?
- Looking for your baby, Rand? - Or your husband?

427
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:39,032
那裏
There.

428
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:41,397
好了！
We're done.

429
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:57,848
妳今天很忙嗎？
Do you have a big day today?

430
01:23:59,014 --> 01:24:00,652
會做到很晚嗎？
Do you finish late?

431
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:11,600
如果妳快點回來，他就不會死了！
If you'd come sooner, he wouldn't be dead.

432
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:19,507
我就不會是隻老鼠了，只要妳快一點回來
I wouldn't be a rat if you'd come sooner.

433
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,411
小蕩婦！
Little slut!

434
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:31,888
一下子和阿拉伯人，一下子和猶太人
Now with the Arabs, now with the Jews!

435
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,966
妳對他們怎麼說我們的？
What will you tell them about us?

436
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:50,199
那一種人比較好？猶太人還是阿拉伯人？
Who tastes better, the Jews or the Arabs?

437
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:55,882
喂，克洛伊？那一種人呢？
Huh, Chloé? Who?

438
01:25:13,422 --> 01:25:15,902
回家吧！妳這隻骯髒的母狗！
Go back home, you dirty bitch!

439
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:15,657
他很快就回來
He'll be back soon.

440
01:27:24,519 --> 01:27:26,362
你還好吧？
You OK?

441
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,132
你確定？
You sure?

442
01:30:14,923 --> 01:30:16,561
小心！
Watch it!

443
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:22,772
-要點咖啡嗎？ -好呀！
- Like some coffee? - Yes.

444
01:30:41,516 --> 01:30:43,996
這是妳點的，糖！
Here you are. Sugar.

445
01:32:05,967 --> 01:32:08,243
是的，媽，我還活著
Yes, mom, I'm alive.

446
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:20,183
請待在直線裏！
Stay in a straight line, please!

447
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:25,247
我，蘭德-薩巴哈，
I, Rand Sabbah,

448
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:28,953
寧願以死亡之姿而存在，而不願意活著卻看不見
prefer to exist in death than to live unseen.

449
01:33:32,253 --> 01:33:35,393
將不再有人可以奪走我存在的權利
No one will ever again take away my right to exist.

450
01:33:38,126 --> 01:33:41,437
我不是石牆，我不是岩石
I am not a wall. I am not a rock.

451
01:33:43,998 --> 01:33:47,912
當我和我的寶貝團聚時，我會高高的抬起頭來
I hold my head high as I go to join my baby.

452
01:33:50,004 --> 01:33:52,143
我的血，泣訴著我的故事
My blood, tell my story.

453
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:56,185
給所有我愛的人，我問候你們
To all those I love, I greet you.

454
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:00,423
我希望能在天堂中再看到你們
I hope to meet you again in heaven.

455
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:03,788
求主垂憐
Inch'Allah.

456
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:33,386
一棵很大的樹...
A very big tree...

457
01:34:54,068 --> 01:34:56,412
和另一棵，小一點的...
and another, smaller one...

458
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:02,316
在它的旁邊長大
that's growing next to it.

459
01:40:59,867 --> 01:41:02,507
獻給我的兒子
TO MY SONS
