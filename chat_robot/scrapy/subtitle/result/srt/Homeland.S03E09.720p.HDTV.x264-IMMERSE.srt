00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,938
前面这段每集都有，我就不翻译了
相信大家可能就直接跳过去了

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,075
PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,044
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

4
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,946
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,381
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,050
<i>in Africa, Europe</i>
<i>and the Middle East.</i>

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,753
PRESIDENT GEORGE HW BUSH: <i>This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,455
REAGAN: <i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,056
PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

10
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,658
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,892
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

12
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,794
This was an act of terrorism.

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,330
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

14
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,766
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
is one of the good old
favorites.

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,403
...until something stops him.

17
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,239
CARRIE: <i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

18
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,907
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

19
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,977
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

20

<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

21
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:51,484
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

22
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,252
(speaking Arabic)

23
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,525
SAUL: <i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,694
<i>I've ever known.</i>

25
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,329
CARRIE: <i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

26
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,464
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

27
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,203
SAUL:
<i>Take 'em.</i>

28
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,972
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

29
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:23,016
Homeland - 3x09
"Horse And Wagon"

30
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,652
前情提要也不翻译了，直接正文开始
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

31
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:27,853
I got plans for you.

32
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,021
What plans?

33
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,823
I'm gonna play you back
into Iran.

34
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,859
From now on, you work for us.

35
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,327
The Senator's made
some serious allegations.

36
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,697
That you had Majid Javadi
in a safe house

37
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,299
on American soil
and let him go.

38
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,401
We debriefed him, turned him.

39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,270
He's ours.

40
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,074
I've made a decision to give
the marriage another chance.

41
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,727
_

42
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,645
(car door shuts) _

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,219
So I told him something

44
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,788
before you left...
about the Langley bomber.

45
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,989
You mean Brody.

46
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,558
No, that's just it.
It's not him.

47
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,027
The bomber's the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

48
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,929
Carrie, what the fuck
are you doing?

49
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,864
ADAL:
Carrie, turn around now.

50
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,567
This is your last warning.

51
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,570
(shouts)

52
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,905
Got a gunshot wound
to the upper left bicep.

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,807
significant bleeding.
Might have clipped an artery.

54
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,376
Where the fuck is Saul?

55
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,510
你醒了
You're awake.

56
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,081
我在哪？
Where am I?

57
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,182
海军医院
The Naval hospital.

58
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,184
在你中枪后，他们把你带到这里来的
They brought you here
after you were shot.

59
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,253
(呻吟)
(groans)

60
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,888
小心点，你不想把刚缝好的伤口撕裂吧
Careful, you don't want
to rip the sutures.

61
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,989
Quite a few of them.

62
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,593
恰好穿过，没伤着骨头
It was a through and through.
Missed the bone.

63
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,830
有一些肌肉和组织的损伤，神经无碍
Some muscle and tissue damage
but no nerve involvement.

64
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,164
你很幸运啊
You're lucky.

65
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,967
不，他是一个好的射手
No, he's just a great shot.

66
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,004
我在这里还得待多久？
How long will I be in here?

67
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,740
只要你还需要待在这里
As long as you need to be.

68
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,109
等我痊愈了呢
For me to heal

69
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,611
还是等CIA来处置我？
or for the CIA to figure out
what to do with me?

70
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,713
你得跟他们谈谈
You'd have to talk to them.

71
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,286
你知不知道你已经怀孕13周了？
Are you aware
you're 13 weeks pregnant?

72
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,722
是的，我知道
Yes.

73
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,362
孩子应该没事
The baby should be fine.

74
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,997
如果你想知道的话
In case you're wondering.

75
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,401
(开门，关门)
(door opens, closes)

76

太他妈低了
Too fucking low.

79
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,727
(虚弱地呻吟)
(groans weakly)

80
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,339
- 躺下
- Lay down.
- (嘴里咕哝着)
- (grunting)

81
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,338
他在飞机上开始戒毒
He started going
cold turkey on the flight,

82
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,364
所以，他们用半针管的
so they knocked him out

83
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,280
-伏特加控制住他
- with a half pint of vodka.
- 傻瓜们
- Idiots.

84
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,248
(groans)

85

MODARRES:
脉搏微弱
Pulse is thready.

86

(groans)

87
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,926
(yells)

88
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,096
放松
Take it easy.

89
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,301
我的东西在哪里，你们这些混蛋小偷们？
Where's my stuff,
you fucking thieves?!

90
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,835
*，我的东西在哪里？
Fuck! Where is my stuff?!

91
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,104
冷静，该死的！
Calm down, goddamn it!

92
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,214
(抽泣着)我的东西呢？
(sobs):
Where's my stuff?

93
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,482
别动
Don't move now.

94
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,488
你还有7天时间
ADAL:
You've got seven days till

95
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,489
Lockhart就要上任了
Lockhart's confirmed.

96
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,327
你觉得到那时，这个家伙会准备好吗？
You think this guy's
gonna be ready by then?

97
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,096
他不是我们想要的
He's not what we expected...

98
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,565
但是我们只有他了
but he's what we've got.

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,866
如果他答应做得话
If he agrees to do it.

100
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,236
他情况一团糟
He's a mess...

101

贫血...
anemic...

HIV没有蔓延
HIV isn't a stretch.

104
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,313
如果你是说要去医院的话，那不可能
If you're suggesting a hospital,
it's out of the question.

105
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,882
我非常确定，我能让他保持稳定
I'm pretty sure
I can keep him stable,

106
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,851
但是这个家伙是有毒瘾的，sir
but the guy's a junkie, sir.

107
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,953
他得多久能好
How far is he into withdrawal?

108
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,855
还没开始
TURANI:
Hardly started.

109
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,423
他现在的情况
What he's feeling now,

110
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,792
会变得更糟
it's gonna get
a hell of a lot worse.

111
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,928
美沙酮能够缓解一些
Methadone would make it easier.

112
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,763
必须立刻戒毒
Has to be cold turkey.

113
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,666
不管怎样，我没得让他正常起来
Where he's going,
we need him functional.

114
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,368
即使这会杀死他吗？
Even if it kills him?

115
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,602
不会的
It won't.

116
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,338
因为你会让他活下来的
'Cause you will keep him alive.

117
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,274
明白吗？
Do you understand?

118
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,010
sir.
Sir.

119
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,319
(沉重的呼吸着)
(breathing heavily)

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,129
(干呕，恶心)
(retching)

121
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,864
(咳)
(coughing)

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,567
(喘气)
(panting)

123
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,452
你还好吧？
You all right?

124
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,488
哇哇！
Whoa, whoa!

125
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,091
停下来，你在干什么？
Stop!
What are you doing?

126
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,159
我需要它！
I need it!

127
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,427
你不能在用这个了
There's nothing there for you.

128
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,896
- 不，我现在很需要它！
- No, I need it now!
- 不
- No.

129
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,930
(西班牙语)给我，给我，给我...
(In Spanish) Give it to me,
give it to me, give me...

130
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,365
嘿，拿下它！
Hey, grab him!

131
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,670
针头在哪里？
Where's the needle?

132
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,005
- 找到了
- Got it.
- (sobs)

133
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,074
给他盖起来，躺下
Cover him up.
Stay down.

134
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,942
(wheezing):
Please...

135
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,858
感觉怎样？
How are you feeling?

136
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,799
医生说你恢复的不错
The doctor says
you're progressing nicely.

137
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,268
你马上就可以起来行走
You'll be up and walking
in no time.

138
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,004
但是，不能走出这里
Though, not necessarily
out of here.

139
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,608
外面有两个武装的保卫在门外
There are two armed guards
outside your door.

140
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,982
你知道，这从来都不能停止让我吃惊
You know it never ceases
to amaze me

141
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,084
你们这些人是怎么团结在一起的
how you people close ranks.

142
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,954
Here you are,

143
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,592
一次CIA行动的意外事故大错特错
a casualty of some CIA op
gone very, very wrong,

144
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,926
基本上是一个囚犯
basically a prisoner,

145
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,898
而且，不管怎样，我还是敌人
and still, somehow,
I'm the enemy.

146
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,500
你应该明白
You are aware

147
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,935
CIA没有被允许
that the CIA charter
does not include

148
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,438
在美国本土开展行动？
operations on US soil?

149
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,708
你知道，我在用止痛药
You know, I'm on painkillers.

150
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,044
我几乎不明白你在说什么
I can barely understand anything
you're saying.

151
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,148
好吧...
Well...

152
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,985
我看过你的资料
I've been going through
your file.

153
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,090
事实是，
The fact is,

154
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,959
你需要一个可以信任的人
you need someone you can trust.

155
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,029
为什么？
And why is that?

156
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,800
你被击中，躺在哪，你需要问一问
You're lying there shot
and you need to ask?

157
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,069
对你做出这一切的那个人
The man who did this to you,

158
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,972
他现在正在出去的路上
he's on his way out.

159
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,176
但是，我需要知道
But I need to know...

160
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,344
他去做什么？
what's he up to?

161
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,514
去问他吧
Ask him.

162
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,517
他在加拉加斯(委内瑞拉首都)做什么？
What was he doing in Caracas?

163
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,058
你甚至不知道他在那里，是吧？
You didn't even know
he was there, did you?

164
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,978
我刚从Carrie那里得到一条消息
I got another message
from Carrie.

165
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,646
她已经完全冷静下来了？
Is she calming down at all?

166
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,048
不，恰恰相反
No, the opposite.

167
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,118
参议院Lockhart刚才去看她了
Senator Lockhart
just paid her a visit.

168
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,188
不知怎么，他知道加拉加斯的事
Somehow, he knows
about Caracas.

169
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,256
这不可能
It's impossible.

170
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,624
他确实知道
Well, he does.

171
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,026
你认为他怀疑？
You think he suspects?

172
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,962
我确定他不知道一点线索
I'm sure he doesn't
have a clue.

173
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,432
但是她现在知道了
She does now.

174
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,300
那么，我们怎么办？
So what do we do about that?

175
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,369
和以前一样
Same as before;

176
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,439
让她在医院待着，继续看守
keep her under guard
at the hospital.

177
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,674
远离Brody
Away from Brody.

178
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,042
和Lockhart？
And Lockhart?

179
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:16,047
我不知道他到底怎么发现的
I don't know how
the hell he found out.

180
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:20,051
除了我们俩个，没有人知道
No one knew besides us.

181
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,554
我们的房子和办公室清扫了吗？
Have our houses
and offices swept.

182
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,724
每一个房间，从上到下
Every room, top to bottom.

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,166
发生了什么？
TURANI:
What happened?

184
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,201
拉到裤子上了
Shat himself.

185
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,736
天哪
Jesus Christ.

186
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,116
你是谁？
Who are you?

187
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,184
别说话
Don't talk.

188
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,153
你是军人，是吧？
You're soldiers, aren't you?

189
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,221
别说话
Don't talk.

190
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,557
烫死了，烫死了！
It's burning!
It's burning.

191
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,592
这不烫
It's not hot.

192
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,028
烫死了
It's burning!

193
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,764
(抽泣)
(sobs)

194
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,034
现在这种糟糕的情况，也许会更糟，可能还会持续3天，
TURANI: It'll continue as bad as
this, or worse, another three days.

195
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,402
而且至少一周后，
And at least a week after that

196
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,770
那些东西才能从体内排出来
before the stuff's out
of his system.

197
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,738
所以，你说的就是10天
So you're saying ten days.

198
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,839
我们只有6天
We have six.

199
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,441
而且，这一切结束后
Plus, at the end of all this,

200
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,643
他将变成一只虚弱的小猫
he's gonna be weak
as a fuckin' kitten.

201
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,281
还有一个选择
There is another option.

202
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,817
什么？
What?

203
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,319
(一种致幻剂，可以戒毒)
Ibogaine.

204
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,888
是从一种尼日利亚植物中提取的毒品
It's a drug based
on a Nigerian plant.

205
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,057
它能很快的加速恢复的过程
It dramatically accelerates
the withdrawal process

206
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,725
而且戒绝毒瘾
and kills the addiction.

207
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,760
副作用是残忍的
The side effects are brutal,

208
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,228
这就是为什么我们现在法律不允许使用
which is why
it's outlawed here.

209
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,165
恶心，呕吐，幻觉
Nausea, vomiting,
some hallucinations.

210
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,166
暴力的，
TURANI:
Violent,

211
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,169
离奇古怪的幻觉
mind-bending hallucinations.

212
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,370
有效吗？
Does it work?

213
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,406
有
ADAL:
It does.

214
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,376
听我的
Take my word.

215
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,770
(轻轻的哔哔声)
(beeping softly)

216
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,408
(哔哔声加快)
(beeping rapidly)

217
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,113
(哔哔声停止)
(beeping stops)

218
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,151
(歌声)

219
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:10,388

说点什么，****
Say something, you motherfucker.

223
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,507
别老站在那
Don't just stand there.

224
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,880
说点什么
Say something...

225
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,882
(轻轻抽泣)
(sobbing quietly)

226

00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,471

231
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,940
(抽泣)
(sobs)

232
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:02,941
(呻吟)
(moans)

233
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,310
哦...
Oh...

234
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,779
上帝...
God...

235
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,781
(moaning)

236
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,821
出去
Get out.

237
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,523
出去
Get out!

238
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,260
(sobs)

239
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,030
你们给了我什么？！
What the fuck did you give me?!

240
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,967
(Brody sobs)

241
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,239
不...
No...

242
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,176
(咕哝声)
(grunts)

243
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,560
(grunts)

244
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,595
(both grunting)

245
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,998
给我那个！
Give me that!

246
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,065
滚开！
- (shouts in Arabic)
BRODY: - Get off me!

247
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,434
滚！
- Get off!
- (men shouting in Arabic)

248
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,238
滚开！
Get off of me!

249
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,741
滚！
Get off!

250
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,742
(speaking Arabic)

251
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,277
滚,不！
Get off me, no!

252
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,778
(speaking Arabic)

253
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,870
他马上睡着了
He'll sleep now.

254
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,140
得一会儿
For a while.

255
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,047
(叹息)
(sighs)

256
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,019
也许我们应该马上给Saul打电话
MAX: Maybe we should just
call Saul's landline,

257
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,554
打开化控开关
trigger the voice activation,

258
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,956
复查一遍我们的追踪程序
double-check our
tracking program.

259
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,357
我们可以
We could.

260
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,392
但是...？
MAX:
But...?

261
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,861
这个房子专线连接至
This house is leased to

262
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,362
一个特拉维夫市(以色列港市)运输集团
a shipping consortium
out of Tel Aviv.

263
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,598
- 这会让摩萨德(以色列情报机关)大篇幅报道的
- It's got Mossad written all over it.
MAX：- 是的
MAX: - Yeah,

264
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,966
但是如果这只是一个监视站呢
but what if it's just
a monitoring station,

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,133
或者一个秘密情报传送点？
or a dead drop?

266
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,135
那我们就浪费时间了
Then we're wasting
our fucking time.

267
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,806
(叹息)
(sighs)

268
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,244
看见这个了吗？
Are you gettin' this?

269
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,335
你还活着
You're alive.

270
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,575
那不是恩赐给你的
That wasn't a given.

271
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,563
想喝点水吗？
Want some water?

272
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,700
你为什么不把握丢在那里，让我死去？
Why couldn't you have just
left me there to die?

273
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,972
我认为你知道那根本就不是一个选择
I think you know that
wasn't really an option.

274
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,642
所以...
So...

275
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,678
(吞咽)
(swallows)

276
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,581
现在怎样？
what now?

277
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,418
那取决于你
That'll be up to you.

278
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,420
审判我？
A trial?

279
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,791
我没有做
'Cause I didn't do it.

280
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,494
你是说CIA爆炸的事？
You talking about
bombing the CIA?

281
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,797
我倾向于同意
I'm inclined to agree.

282
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,769
但你犯下的罪行不是从这个开始，也不是从这个结束(指：你犯的罪不只这些)
But your transgressions
don't begin or end there.

283
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,140
我会参与进一个来来回回
And I'm not about to engage
in a back and forth

284
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,509
最终不知怎么你成为受害者的事中
where you somehow
end up the victim.

285
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,180
我们俩个都知道你做了什么
We both know what you've done.

286
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,583
我们俩个都知道你是怎样的
We both know what you are.

287
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,520
一个挖了一个深坑把自己埋进去的人
A man who's dug himself
into a hole so deep,

288
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,522
常识都会告诉你，你没有出路了
common sense'd tell you
there's no way out.

289
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,363
我正在告诉你的是，可能还有出路
I am telling you, though,
that there might be.

290
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,799
如何？
How?

291
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,305
我给你一个机会
I'm offering you a chance

292
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,974
重新成为海军陆战队成员
to be a Marine again.

293
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,713
那个曾经的你
The man you were...

294
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,983
在你被摧残之前
before they broke you.

295
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,589
请别
Please.

296
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,624
(叹息)
(sighs)

297
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,698
不会了
No more.

298
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,033
我已经完了
I'm done.

299
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,702
你没有
SAUL (quietly):
You are not.

300
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,807
这将是你最的最后一件事
You will do
this one last thing.

301
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,108
不
BRODY:
No.

302
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,111
那么杀了我吧
So kill me.

303
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,846
现在就杀了我
Kill me now.

304
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,881
(咳)
(coughing)

305
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,056
你想死，是吧？
You want to die, huh?

306
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,092
(叹息)
(sighs)

307
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,929
我们走着瞧
We'll see about that.

308
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,977
(引擎转动)
(engine idles)

309
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,013
(引擎停止)
(engine stops)

310
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,584
把他扔下船去
AZIZI:
Put him overboard.

311
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,387
(grunts)

312
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,076
***，我马上下去
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in.

313
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,878
别，他会上来的
Don't. He'll come up.

314
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,249
我不相信
(whispering):
I don't believe this.

315
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,436
*！走
Fuck it.
Let's go.

316
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,189
(sputters)

317
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,762
拉他一下
Pull him...

318
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,837
(咳)
(coughs)

319
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,441
(coughing)

320
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,510
他像一块石头一样下去了
He went down like a stone.

321
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,379
完全没有尝试自救啊
No attempt to save
himself whatsoever.

322
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,314
现在他拒绝吃饭
Now he's refusing to eat.

323
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,715
强迫他吃
Make him.

324
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,217
你让我们怎么做
How do you expect us
to do that?

325
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,853
这叫做强行喂食
It's called
force-feeding.

326
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:29,987
恕我直言,sir
AZIZI:
All due respect, sir,

327
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,489
这家伙在这就是浪费空间
the guy's a waste of space.

328
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,591
现在，我建议不管你对他有什么想法
Now, I suggest whatever
you've got in mind for him,

329
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,759
还是放在6个月后吧
just push it six months.

330
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,993
让我们来处理好这件事吧
Let us do this thing right.

331
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,729
你让我照你想的做？
You done letting us in
on your thought process?

332
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,898
是的，sir
Yes, sir.

333
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,034
让他吃
Get him to eat.

334
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,275
他是对的，你知道
He's right, you know.

335
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,311
我们的窗户关得太快了
Our window's closing fast.

336
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,713
现在做不了就没有机会了，Saul
It's now or never, Saul.

337
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,352
(门关了)
(door opens)

338
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,654
(电梯铃声轻轻的响了)
(elevator bell dings faintly)

339
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,100
现在感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

340
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,135
好像你真的在乎一样
As if you actually cared.

341
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,174
你知道，我在这里有时间思考
You know, I've had
time to think here.

342
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,444
我回忆这件事
And I keep coming
back to the fact

343
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,945
如果没有你的同意，我肩膀上
that this bullet in my shoulder

344
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,947
就不会有这颗子弹
would never have happened
without your okay.

345
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,083
你当时就快危害到整个行动了
You were about
to compromise the mission.

346
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,619
我就要为Brody洗白了
I was about to clear Brody.

347
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,254
你说你在后面
You said you were behind that.

348
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,288
“洗白Brody”
"Clear Brody."

349
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,456
这意味着什么？
What does that even mean?

350
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,525
所以你骗了我
So you lied to me.

351
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,095
我认为你不想来讨论
I don't think you
want to go there--

352
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,931
是谁骗了谁
who lied to whom.

353
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,833
Brody逃出这个国家
Brody slipping out
of the country

354
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,135
而你却昏迷14小时
while you were unconscious
for 14 hours.

355
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,106
你认为我曾经相信过这个吗，哪怕一秒？
You think I believed
that for a second?

356
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:10,554
你知道我在加拉加斯，你给我留了个消息
You know I was in Caracas,
you left me a message.

357
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,227
难道你不想知道他现在怎么样吗？
Don't you want
to know how he is?

358
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,401
他现在怎么样？
How is he?

359
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,708
他不太好
He's not well.

360
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,614
你们队他做了什么？
What did you do to him?

361
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,051
你知道，隐藏在这个问题背后的假设是
You know, the assumptions
behind that question

362
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,988
多么的令人误解，这让我害怕
are so misguided,
it frightens me.

363
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,359
我发现他非常不好
I found him in a bad way.

364
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,596
相信我
Believe me.

365
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,165
这不是我想要的
It wasn't something I wanted.

366
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,639
他在哪里？
Where is he?

367
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,042
在弗吉尼亚
In Virginia.

368
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,945
Dam Neck
At Dam Neck.

369
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,814
一个特殊行动小组正在让他恢复
Got a special ops team
trying to get him in shape.

370
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,182
恢复去做什么？
In shape for what?

371
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,718
这就是我想要谈一谈的
That's what I wanted
to talk about.

372
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:20,024
我有一个局
I have a play.

373
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,192
这关系到Brody
It involves Brody.

374
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,896
而且，我希望你能说服他
And I'm hoping
you'll convince him

375
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,865
这关系到每一个人的利益
it's in everyone's interest.

376
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,141
你跟我说Javadi是个局
You told me
Javadi was the play.

377
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,142
他是的
He is.

378
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,745
Brody是下一个阶段
Brody's the next phase.

379
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,315
你为什么需要我？
And you need me why?

380
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,550
我猜他已经拒绝你了
I'm assuming he already
turned you down.

381
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,551
我们还没有到那一步
We didn't get that far.

382
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,053
就像我说的那样，你情况不太好
Like I said, he's not well.

383
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,258
那么，你的想法是什么？
So, what is it?
What's your big idea?

384
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,427
Darnish Akbari 
Darnish Akbari.

385
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,564
伊朗革命军的领袖
Head of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard.

386
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,600
是的
Right.

387
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,335
Javadi的上司
Javadi's boss.

388
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:08,005
同乡和平的唯一一个而且是最大的障碍
And the single greatest
impediment to peace.

389
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,407
我想让他消失
I want him gone.

390
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,409
(轻轻的笑)
(quiet laugh)

391
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,514
好吧，那祝你好运
Well, good luck with that.

392
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,384
Brody能够接近他
Brody can get to him.

393
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,752
怎样？
How?

394
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,387
作为兰利爆炸的作案者
As the Langley bomber.

395
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,557
Brody可以在那里寻求政治避难
Brody seeks political
asylum there.

396
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,959
得到Akbari的借鉴，把他带出来
Gets an audience with Akbari,
takes him out.

397
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,063
Javadi是他的继承人
Javadi's the heir apparent.

398
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,066
他走上王位，他就会从
He ascends the throne,
and he goes from being

399
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,335
伊朗最终要的20个人之一变成
one of the 20
most important people in Iran

400
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,337
最重要的3个人之一
to one of three.

401
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,907
只要他为我们工作
Only he's working for us.

402
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,244
Brody把他引出来？
Brody takes him out?

403
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,179
是的
Yes.

404
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,914
得了吧，Saul，你想的太多了
Come on, Saul, you're reaching.

405
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,050
Akbari的保护要比Ayatollah好得多
Akbari's better protected
than the Ayatollah.

406
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,722
Brody已经有非常娴熟的技巧能够进入一个严密的地方
Brody's got a knack for
getting into tight places.

407
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,724
他以前就这样做过
He's done it before.

408
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,593
这是一个自杀行动
At best it's a suicide mission.

409
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,363
不，他会有一个小队支援
No, he'll have a
team on the ground.

410
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,465
你想让我去说服他？
And you expect me
to convince him of this?

411
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,268
我希望你仔细考虑
I expect you to consider
deeply the upside

412
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:13,971
将美国的利益放在伊朗这条食物链的最高端
of placing a US asset
at the very top

413
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,473
of the Iranian food chain.

414
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,609
这才是我想要的
That's what I expect.

415
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,381
Javadi不能只是一个情报源
Javadi won't be just
an intelligence source.

416
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,683
他将掌管
He'll be in control

417
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,053
整个伊朗的安保
of the entire Iranian
security apparatus.

418
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,289
那不意味着他将违反之前的约定而装死
That doesn't mean
he'll roll over and play dead.

419
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:34,091
我知道
I know.

420
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,895
但是他可以做点什么的
But he can do something.

421
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,155
一些能打破这条长线的事
Something to break
the long jump.

422
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:45,035
一些战争之外的事
Something besides another war.

423
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,074
一些能够改变现实的事
Something that'll change
the facts on the ground...

424
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,110
这就够了...
just enough...

425
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,379
所以两个30年都没有能够交流的国家

been able to communicate

除了恐怖袭击和威胁

428
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,656
可以坐下来谈一谈

00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,307
(呼气)
(exhales)

436
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,856
嘿
Hey.

437
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,159
(叹息)
(sighs)

438
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,067
Brody，我想让你知道
Brody, I want you to know

439
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,035
知道今天我才知道你在这里
that I didn't know
you were here until today.

440
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,037
我一听说就来的
I came as soon as I heard.

441
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,515
告诉我，有没有什么我可以帮你的
Tell me if there's anything
I can do for you.

442
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,419
任何事
Anything.

443
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,779
(门开了)
(door opens)

444
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,982
(门关了)
(door closes)

445
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,601
你什么时候需要他？
When do you need him ready by?

446
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,938
这个月27号
27th of this month.

447
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,506
为什么这么早？
Why so soon?

448
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,974
那天是参议员Lockhart
It's the day Senator Lockhart's

449
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,310
上任听证会的日子
confirmation hearings begin.

450
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,415
好的
Right.

451
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,287
告诉我在加拉加斯发生了什么
Tell me what happened
to him in Caracas.

452
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,323
据我所知就是一团翔
A world of shit
as far as we know.

453
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,125
他在哥伦比亚的边境被枪击了
He was gut-shot
at the Colombian border.

454
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,460
差点死去
Nearly died.

455
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,430
我猜可能止疼药上瘾了
Got hooked on the painkillers,
I guess.

456
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,268
而且在清真寺还发生了意外
There was also
an incident at a mosque.

457
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,870
伊玛目和他的妻子被杀了
An imam and his wife
were murdered.

458
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,006
因为他？
Because of him?

459
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,175
是的，因为他
Because of him.

460
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,785
我需要一辆车
I need a vehicle.

461
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,494
你胳膊怎么了？
What happened to your arm?

462
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,329
滑翔运动时出现了意外
Hang gliding accident.

463
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,897
真的？
For real?

464
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,099
去你的CIA
Fucking CIA, Baraz.

465
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,467
你问她问题干什么？
What are you asking
her questions for?

466
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,969
就是说说话呗
Just making conversation.

467
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,742
下面左转
It's the next left.

468
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,655
现在怎么办？
What now?

469
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,825
等
Now we wait.

470
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,566
我们在房子旁待了24小时
We sat on the house
for 24 hours.

471
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,369
这是唯一一个出入的人
And this is the only person
who ever came in or out.

472
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,272
哦，天啊
Oh, Christ.

473
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,542
你认识他？
QUINN:
You know him?

474
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,411
是的，恐怕是
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

475
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,712
他是谁？
Who is he?

476
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:32,115
我妻子的一个朋友
A friend of my wife's.

477
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,055
他叫Alain Bernard
His name is Alain Bernard.

478
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,390
我妻子在孟买认识他
She met him in Mumbai.

479
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,726
他们在那里保持了一段时间的关系
They struck up
a relationship there,

480
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,295
现在可能还有，或者没有关系了
which may or may not
be ongoing.

481
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:46,963
我讨厌这样问，Saul
ADAL:
I hate to ask this, Saul,

482
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,466
但是你觉得Mira知道吗？
but do you think Mira's aware?

483
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,101
他是一个以色列的情报官
That he's an Israeli
intelligence officer?

484
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,570
不
No.

485
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,706
爱上这个家伙事她唯一的罪行
Falling for the guy is
her only crime.

486
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,875
你想让给我做些什么？
What do you want me to do?

487
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,877
现在？
For the time being?

488
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,145
把他抓起来
Pick him up.

489
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,981
放在一个黑洞里
Put him in a dark fucking hole.

490
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,416
那Lockhart怎么办？
ADAL:
What about Lockhart?

491
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,286
他怎么跟这些有关？
How does he fit
into the equation?

492
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,720
我想我发现了一个线索
I think I buried a lead.

493
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,788
什么？
Meaning what?

494
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,024
当我们这个家伙从安全屋离开的时候
After our guy left
the safe house,

495
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,492
我跟踪他去了Pete's Diner
I followed him to Pete's Diner,

496
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,260
国会山
Capitol Hill.

497
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,968
(wry laugh)

498
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,881
Dana？
Dana?

499
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,666
Dana?
Dana?

500
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,667
Dan...
Dan...

501
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,568
嘿嘿嘿！
Hey, hey, hey!

502
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,070
嘿，***，让我出去！
Hey, assholes, let me out!

503
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:00,904
Brody...
Brody...

504
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,938
放开我
Get off me!

505
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,073
哦，天哪
(grunting, muttering):
Oh... God...

506
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,374
- 让我出去！
- Let me the hell out!
- 放松
- Relax!

507
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:05,475
(grunts)

508
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,143
Brody!
Brody!

509
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,144
***
Motherfucker!

510
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,578
Dana，是我！
Dana, it's me!

511
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,713
Dana!
Dana!

512
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,214
- 回去...
- Get back...
- 放开我...
(growling): - Get off of me...

513
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,849
Dana!
Dana!

514
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,351
*，Dana！
Fuck. Dana!

515
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,819
她听不见你的，Brody.
She can't hear you, Brody.

516
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,922
(喘气)：你...你个婊子
(panting):
You... you bitch.

517
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,525
你个***婊子
You fucking bitch.

518
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,463
(panting)

519
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,241
他在里面吗？
Is he in?
你预约和他见面了吗？
Is he expecting you?

520
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,876
Sir，你不能进去
Sir, you can't go in there.

521
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,412
那天晚上我要举办一个捐款活动
LOCKHART: I'm hosting a
fund-raiser that night anyway.

522
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:43,547
听着，我得挂了
Listen, I got to go.

523
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,748
怎么回事，Saul？
What the hell, Saul?

524
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,017
这是什么？
What is this?

525
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,018
打开
Open it.

526
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,006
有必要解释一下吗？
Care to explain?

527
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,176
Alain Bernard在帮我写一些简历
Alain Bernard is writing
a profile on me for <i>Le Monde.</i>

528
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,178
20分钟前
20 minutes ago,

529
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,513
Alain Bernard成人自己是
Alain Bernard admitted to being

530
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,915
以色列情报的线人
an asset
of Israeli intelligence.

531
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,920
那，我又为什么要关心这个呢？
And I should be concerned
about this... why?

532
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,923
因为，他声称他给了你一些信息
Because he claims he passed you
information obtained

533
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,594
这些信息是来自装在我家的窃听设备
from a listening device
planted in my home.

534
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,266
这简直荒谬！
That's preposterous.

535
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,934
是吗？
Is it?

536
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,904
一个电话给Benayoun大使，
One call to
Ambassador Benayoun,

537
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,673
这将是一个国际事件
it would be
an international incident.

538
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,675
再打一个电话给<i>The Post</i>
A second call to <i>The Post,</i>

539
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,612
然后你的照片将会是
and your picture'd be
on the front page

540
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,681
这个国家每一份报纸的头条
of every newspaper
in the country.

541
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,257
你想要什么？
What do you want?

542
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,059
时间
Time.

543
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,195
时间？
Time?

544
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,396
推迟你的让人？
Postpone your confirmation

545
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,498
直到下个月的中期
until the middle of next month,

546
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:10,900
然后这些将永远不会出现
and these'll never
see the light of day.

547
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,003
我不理解
I don't understand.

548
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,538
这是个非常简单的请求
It's a simple request.

549
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,606
再给我几周时间
Give me a few more weeks.

550
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,174
这不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

551
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,378
你可以用这些击垮我
You could destroy me with this.

552
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,547
你可以保证你作为CIA头的任期
You could guarantee
your own tenure as director.

553
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,516
你为什么要让我摆脱这样的境地？
Why are you letting me
off the hook?

554
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,319
因为这将对我的妻子造成羞辱，参议员
Because it would humiliate
my wife, Senator.

555
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,624
而且会对局里造成伤害
And because it would
damage the Agency.

556
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,660
非常严重地
Badly.

557
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,235
那么我们达成协议了？
We have a deal?

558
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,406
是的
We do.

559
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,635
我希望你已经足够冷静来和我说话了
I was hoping you've calmed
down enough to talk.

560
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,737
Dana在一个前不着村后不着店的汽车旅馆做什么？
What's Dana doing
cleaning motel rooms

561
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,706
- in the middle of nowhere?
- 为什么？
- Why?

562
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,773
有什么不对的吗？
Is something wrong with that?

563
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,275
- 作为一个服务员？
- Being a maid?
- There's nothing

564
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,243
没有什么不对的，该死的，我就是想知道
wrong with that, goddamn it--
I just want to know

565
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,346
我女儿发生了什么！
what's going on
with my daughter!

566
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,085
喝吧，喝完我跟你讲Dana
Drink it, and I'll tell you
about Dana.

567
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,162
慢点，别犯恶心
Slowly, or you'll be sick.

568
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,637
好了
There.

569
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,708
怎么回事？
Now, what's going on?

570
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,911
Brody，她以前一阵子过得很不好
Well, she's had
a rough time, Brody.

571
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,280
她退学了
She dropped out of school.

572
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,317
从你们家搬出来了
She moved out of the house.

573
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,087
她改了她的姓
She changed her last name.

574
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,929
带我去那个汽车旅馆
Take me back to the motel.

575
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,930
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

576
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,931
看在上帝的份上，Carrie
For Christ's sake, Carrie.

577
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,266
我告诉过你了
I told you.

578
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,402
如果你还想再见着她，你就得...
if you want to see her again
you have to...

579
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,836
退出你的游戏吧，Carrie！
Quit your fucking games, Carrie!

580
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,405
我得亲眼看见她
I need to look her in the eye.

581
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,006
我想让她知道我是清白的
I want her to know
I'm innocent!

582
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,342
如果你继续喊的话，谈话就此结束
If you keep yelling,
this conversation is over.

583
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,512
仙子我想要让这两个人离开，
Now I would like

584
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,814
to tell these two men to leave,
可以吗？
can I do that?

585
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,995
(开门)
(door opens)

586
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,063
(huffs)

587
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,999
(关门)
(door closes)

588
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:04,674
你想要什么？
What do you want?

589
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:08,044
我猜和Saul说的一样吧
The same thing as Saul
Berenson, I'm guessing.

590
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,446
一些关于我再次成为海军陆战队成员的狗屎话？
Some bullshit about me
being a Marine again?

591
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,715
你想要什么，Brody？
What do you want, Brody?

592
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,285
一直以来，你想要什么?
What have you always wanted?

593
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,621
一个赎罪的机会
A chance at redemption.

594
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,559
最后一次告诉你，Carrie，炸弹不关我的事
For the last time, Carrie.
I didn't do the bombing.

595
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,194
你们都应该知道的
You of all people
should know that.

596
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,696
我不是说炸弹的事
I'm not talking
about the bombing.

597
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,533
我是说自杀背心的事
I'm talking
about the suicide vest.

598
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:35,472
我是说Elizabeth Gaines的死
I'm talking about the death
of Elizabeth Gaines

599
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,040
和那两个秘密特工的死
and those
two Secret Service agents

600
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,542
outside the State Department.

601
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,679
我在说在加拉加斯发生在伊玛目和
I'm talking about what happened

602
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,982
他妻子身上的事
to that imam and his wife
in Caracas.

603
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,824
做Saul让你做得事吧
Do what Saul is asking.

604
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,799
你让我做的？
- What you're asking?
是的，是我让你做得
- All right, what I'm asking.

605
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,136
不看在你的份上，看在Dana的份上
If not for your sake,
then for Dana's.

606
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,276
要不然的话，告诉她你是清白的只是
Otherwise, telling her
you're innocent is just...

607
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,515
另外一个谎言罢了
is just one more lie.

608
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,485
看着我，Carrie
Look at me, Carrie.

609
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,458
你现在不能派我出去为了一包香烟
You couldn't send me out for a
pack of cigarettes right now.

610
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,730
我们会帮你准备好的
We'll get you ready.

611
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,101
你需要做得就是愿意就好
You just have to be willing.

612
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:47,476
- (喘气)
- (panting)
- (indistinct chatter)

613
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,120
看呐，谁出来玩了
Well, look who's come
out to play.

614
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,388
BARAZ:
About fucking time.

615
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,823
得到妈妈的同意了吗？
Did you get Mommy's permission?

616
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,925
闭嘴，你们
Hey, shut the fuck up,
everybody.

617
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,661
我们要从这边走了
We're going this way.

618
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:06,696
你准备好了吗
You ready?

619
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,749
起来
Come on.

620
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:27,783
自己站起来
On your feet.

621
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,591
不，他得自己来
No.
He needs to do it by himself.

622
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:57,213
告诉我你什么时候能继续跑了
Tell me when you're
good to go again.

623
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,014
现在
Now.

624
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,049
走
Go.

625
00:42:08,032 --> 00:42:10,522
16天后

626
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,043
找到马普托，莫桑比克
Find Maputo, Mozambique.

627
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,312
频率是多少？
What's the frequency?

628
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,580
KHZ 3265
KHZ 3265.

629
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,487
他们讲的是什么语言？
AZIZI: <i>What language</i>
<i>are they speaking?</i>

630
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,488
葡萄牙语
Portuguese.

631
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:47,496
底下的三张牌？
Bottom three cards?

632
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,764
梅花8
Eight of clubs.

633
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,399
(gunshot)

634
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,267
红桃10
Ten of hearts.

635
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:52,802
(gunshot)

636
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,871
黑桃J
Jack of spades?

637
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,109
拼出她的姓
Spell her last name.

638
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:02,611
Uh, B-A-C-Z-

639
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,513
<i>E-W-S-K-I. Baczewski.</i>

640
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,682
这里说她比谁更火辣？
BARAZ: <i>It says here</i>
<i>she's hotter than what?</i>

641
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,684
BRODY: <i>- Georgia asphalt?</i>
谁说的？
BARAZ: <i>- And who said that?</i>

642
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,619
Lula Fortune对Sailor Ripley说的
Lula Fortune to Sailor Ripley

643
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:11,954
in <i>Wild at Heart.</i>

644
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,223
对了！
Fucking-A right.

645
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:16,058
Yeah！
Yeah.

646
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,239
你们两个之间有什么吧？
So, you guys got
something going on?

647
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:32,575
没有
No.

648
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,577
得了吧
Come on, man,

649
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,579
我看见她在外面看你的样子
I've seen the way
she's checking you out

650
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,913
当你没有看见的时候
when you're not looking.

651
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,282
什么都没有
There's nothing.

652
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,884
真的？
Seriously?

653
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,553
真的
Seriously.

654
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,088
你不介意的话...
So, you don't mind if I...

655
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,323

if I hit that shit then, right?

656
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,794
看？是有什么的吧
(laughing): See?
There is something.

657
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:53,062
我知道的
I knew it.

658
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:54,764
没有的，继续吧，真的
No, go ahead. Really.

659
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,166
哦，我就是和你瞎说的
Nah, man,
I'm just fucking with you.

660
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,435
我结婚了
I'm married.

661
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,204
我们的第一个孩子刚出生
And, uh, we just had
our first kid.

662
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,472
是个男孩
It's a boy.

663
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,042
叫Devon
Name's Devon.

664
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,743
我怎么不知道？
How come I didn't know that?

665
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,679
只是...
Just...

666
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,182
我不喜欢谈论我的家庭
I don't like
talking about my family.

667
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:14,650
(敲)
(knocks)

668
00:44:14,684 --> 00:44:16,185
迷信
Superstitious.

669
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,425
(筛子在桌子上滚)
(dice roll on table)

670
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,793
我们要开始了
Hey, we're on in five.

671
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,294
在指挥室
In the briefing room.

672
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,530
(sighs)

673
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:31,967
伊朗巡逻队在这个地区是断断续续的
Iranian patrols
in the area are intermittent.

674
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,970
但是他们训练有素，而且装备精良
But they are well-trained
and equipped.

675
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,639
而且，这里还有个空军基地
Also, there is also
an IRIAF base

676
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:38,674
70英里外
in Bijar, 70 miles away,

677
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,643
也就是说他们可以请求空军支援
which means they can call
in air support.

678
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:42,611
我们要谈论的计划是怎么样的？
AZIZI: What kind of
planes are we talking?

679
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,680
第一次海湾战争之后被留在伊朗的法国造的F-1
Uh, some French-built
F-1 Mirages impounded

680
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:46,115
from Iraq
after the First Gulf War

681
00:44:46,149 --> 00:44:48,317
和6个中国的SU-24
and six Chinese SU-24s.

682
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,219
抱歉，我们能倒退一分钟吗？
Excuse me, can we back up
a minute?

683
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:51,454
当然
Sure.

684
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,255
这些人把握带到边境
The guys gets me
to the border...

685
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,557
然后我投降
where I surrender myself?

686
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,292
是的
Correct.

687
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,727
我们之所以选择Marivan是因为一些基地组织的指挥官
We chose Marivan because
several Al-Qaeda commanders

688
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,696
也是在那里请求政治避难的
also asked
for political asylum there.

689
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,466
我飞到Tehran之后呢？
What happens then?
I get flown to Tehran?

690
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,836
在一段时期的审查之后，我们是这么预想的
After a period of vetting,
yeah, that's our expectation.

691
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,939
好的，你是怎么觉得我能够距离
Okay, but what makes you think
I'll ever get close enough

692
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,041
Akbari足够的近并把他引出来？
to General Akbari
to take him out?

693
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:15,077
你将会得到像革命英雄一样的待遇
SAUL: You'll be treated as
a hero of the Revolution.

694
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,179
一些政坛的高层，像将军这样的，
The senior members of the
regime, like the general,

695
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,249
就会想利用你的宣传作用
want to take advantage
of your propaganda value.

696
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:22,084
加上Javadi会促成你和Akbari的会谈
Plus Javadi's on the ground

697
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,353
to facilitate a meeting
between the two of you.

698
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:25,855
但是如果我们不知道什么时候或者什么地点
But if we don't know
where or when

699
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,022
发生暗杀呢...？
the assassination goes down...?

700
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,858
你在考虑我们已经想好的计划了
You're concerned about
our extraction plan.

701
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,493
一旦行动完成，我们怎么把你弄出来？
How we're gonna get you
out of there once it's done?

702
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,861
是的
Yeah.

703
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,530
我马上就要说到了
I was just getting to that.

704
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,465
一旦你进入边境
Once you're inserted
at the border,

705
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,533
你队里的四个成员
four members of your team

706
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,702
将继续从南去Nodesheh
will continue south to Nodesheh,

707
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,304
在那里他们会穿过一座山，然后
where they cross the mountains
and make their way overland

708
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,841
到达Lavasan，这是Tehran外面的一个小城
to Lavasan, a small city
just outside Tehran.

709
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,277
反对派在那里会给我们提供一个
Opposition groups there
have provided us

710
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:49,912
安全屋
with a safe house.

711
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,547
我们已经先行动，
We've already gone ahead

712
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,216
做好了安全通信卫星的事情
and put in secure Satcom.

713
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,219
我们的暗号是...
Our code there is...
(speaking Persian)

714
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,974
你从什么时候开始抽烟的？
Since when do you smoke?

715
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,776
我没有
I don't.

716
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,278
我没有
I'm not.

717
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,717
只是看起来像我在抽烟
It just looks like I'm smoking.

718
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,753
(chuckles)

719
00:46:32,088 --> 00:46:33,722
从没发生过
There.
It never happened.

720
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,924
你什么都没看见
You saw nothing.

721
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,259
什么都没有
Nothing.

722
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,362
看着...
Look...

723
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,797
我做了你让我做的
I did what you asked.

724
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:44,099
我正在做你想要我做的
I'm doing what you want.

725
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,069
你告诉过我要带我再去见一次Dana
Now you told me you'd
take me to see Dana again.

726
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:49,805
我的意思是等你回来
I meant after you get back.

727
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,407
得了吧，Carrie
Come on, Carrie.

728
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,376
我们都知道这次任务得很长时间
We both know
that's a long shot.

729
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,681
我们让它这么远
We made it this far.

730
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,916
是的
That's true.

731
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,323
我承认，我有我的疑问
I admit, I had my doubts.

732
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,924
什么？
Oh?

733
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,260
这就是你保持距离的原因吗？
Is that why you've
kept your distance?

734
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,830
嘿，没事
Hey, it's fine.

735
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:16,098
你配得上
You're entitled.

736
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,571
(sighs)

737
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,674
你6个小时候就要出发了
You're loading out
in six hours.

738
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,676
我不确定能不能带你离开基地又按时回来
I'm not sure I can get you off
the base and back in time.

739
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,579
看不见Dana我不不会离开
Well, I'm not leaving
until I see Dana again.

740
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:50,199
在那里，119
It's there. 119.

741
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:58,841
Brody，有一些事情你得知道
Brody, there's something
you need to know.

742
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,177
在她改名字之前
Before she changed her name,

743
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,646
在她离开家里之前
before she left home...

744
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,550
Dana在医院接受治疗
Dana was hospitalized.

745
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,656
爆炸发生两周后
About two weeks
after the bombing...

746
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,592
她曾试图自杀
she tried to kill herself.

747
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,689
谁？
DANA:
Who is it?

748
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,492
Dana，是我
Dana, it's me.

749
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,595
你爸爸
It's your dad.

750
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:57,966
(百叶窗沙沙响)
(blinds rustle)

751
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,390
(门栓打开)
(latch clicks)

752
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,010
Hi
Hi.

753
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,917
你是怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

754
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,859
Carrie
Carrie.

755
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,031
我能进来吗？
Can I come in?

756
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:09,838
Dana，求你了?
Dana, please?

757
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,656
谢谢你
Thank you.

758
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:32,494
我必须见你
I had to see you.

759
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:36,598
好的
Okay.

760
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,066
你已经见了
You have.

761
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,240
噢，我的宝贝，对不起
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

762
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:48,977
别这样
Don't be.

763
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,319
你现在怎样？
How are you now?

764
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,861
你为什么会在这里？
Why are you here?

765
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,800
我只是想告诉你，那些人说我做过的事情
I just wanted to tell you
that all those things

766
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,802
我没有做
those people said I did,
I didn't do.

767
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:14,903
好的
Fine.

768
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:15,938
好的，好的
Fine, good.

769
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:19,575
我没有杀那些人
I didn't kill all those people.

770
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,076
不是我
It wasn't me.

771
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,579
我没有
I didn't do it.

772
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,483
(sighs)

773
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:32,821
我马上就要离开了
And I have to leave soon.

774
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,823
几个小时后
In a few hours.

775
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:43,265
但是在离开之前我得来看看你
But I just wanted
to see you before I go.

776
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,436
你看到了
You did.

777
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,306
你有没有考虑过
Did you ever,

778
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,642
for one second,

779
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:56,278
我是不是想见你？
think about if
I wanted to see you?

780
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,383
你想听我说什么？
What... what do you
want to hear?

781
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:03,452
你是个好父亲吗？
That you were a good dad?

782
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,489
啊？
(sobbing):
Huh?

783
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,759
不管怎样，一切都OK吗？
That despite everything,
it's all okay?

784
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:13,295
你想让我说什么？
What do you want me to say?

785
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,334
看着
Look...

786
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,502
看着
look, here...

787
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,837
就写在这里
here, just write it down.

788
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:25,641
真的，就写在这里，我会说给你听
Really, just write it down
and I will say it to you...

789
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:28,477
只要你保证
as long as you promise

790
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:30,479
我再也不会见到你
I will never have
to see you again.

791
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,022
你们两个
Either of you.

792
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:45,861
(sobs)

793
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,760
我会从Tehran回来的
I will come back from Tehran.

794
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,364
我知道你会的
I know you will.

795
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,569
不仅仅是为了她
And not just for her.

796
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,684
(car approaching)

797
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:06,074
你们去哪了？
Where the fuck were you?

798
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,242
他像谈一谈
He wanted to talk.

799
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:09,277
45分钟后就要出发了
He's got 45 minutes
to load out.

800
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,746
他准备就绪
He's all set.

801
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,121
你把他带离了基地
You took him off base.

802
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,589
他威胁要出去，Saul
He threatened
to pull out, Saul.

803
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:21,723
在外面任何事都可能发生
Anything could've
happened out there.

804
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,925
但是没有发生啊
But it didn't.

805
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,294
我真的对你失望
I am truly at
a fuckin' loss with you.

806
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,632
有点信心，Saul
Have a little faith, Saul.

807

两周前，没有行动
Two weeks ago,
there was no operation.

808

现在有了，都是因为我
Now there is, because of me.

809
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:38,073
我正想让你知道这点
I really need you to get that.

810
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,142
因为为了我们能够拿下这次行动，
Because in order for us
to pull this thing off,

811
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,576
我们得找个方式重新信任彼此
we're gonna have to find a way

812
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,779
to trust each other again.

813
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,682
或者至少相处一个不错的方法来假装
Or at least come up with a
really great plan for faking it.
