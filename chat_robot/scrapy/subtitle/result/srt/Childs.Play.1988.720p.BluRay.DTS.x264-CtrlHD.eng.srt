1
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,912
MIKE: I got the Strangler.

2
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,789
Wabash and Van Buren.

3
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,320
Oh, shit.

4
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,077
Oh, shit!

5
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,870
MIKE: Jack, get the van.

6
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,122
Eddie, help me!

7
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,167
Eddie, Eddie, don't leave me! God, no!

8
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,895
Give it up, Ray. It's over.

9
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,770
Oh, God, I'm dying.

10
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,277
(SHOUTING) You hear this, you son of a bitch?

11
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,198
I'm gonna get you for it!

12
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,410
I'm gonna get you,

13
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,662
and I'm gonna get Eddie,

14
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,915
no matter what!

15
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:47,643
I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,858
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.

17
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,487
Gotta find somebody.

18
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,072
CHARLES: Give me the power, I beg of you!

19
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,803
BOY 1 ON TV: I have no friends. No one will play with me.

20
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,055
BOY 2 ON TV: Uh-oh.

21
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,140
There's a friend in need.

22
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,393
Hey, cheer up.

23
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,061
Who are you?

24
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,479
I'm a Good Guy.

25
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,981
I've just come from the Good Guy Clubhouse,

26
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,442
and I'll be your friend to the end.

27
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,821
You will? You mean you'll be my friend now?

28
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,365
Sure, I will.

29
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,741
Hidey-ho.

30
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,328
I saw this one.

31
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,434
MAN ON TV: All right, good guys,

32
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,352
that's our Good Guys show for today,

33
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,812
but don't go away,

34
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:23,400
because we've got a very important Good Guy message just for you.

35
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,322
MASCOT ON TV: Hi, Good Guys. Boy, have I got news for you.

36
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,909
Now you can have your very own Good Guy doll.

37
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,327
That's right.

38
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,999
You can have all the adventures we have on TV in your very own home.

39
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,377
Good Guys say three different sentences.

40
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,256
We even turn our heads and blink our eyes when you talk to us.

41
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,841
Right, Oscar?

42
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,262
Hi, I'm Oscar, and I'm your friend to the end. Hidey-ho.

43
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,849
Wow!

44
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,269
MASCOT: Every Good Guy has a name all his own,

45
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,980
so he can be your very own best friend.

46
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,901
So remember to tell Mom and Dad you want a Good Guy.

47
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,779
Perfect for birthdays or just any old time.

48
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:15,785
And remember, you can buy all of our Good Guy accessories, too.

49
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,038
- Right, Oscar?
- Right.

50
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,792
MAN ON TV: Brought to you exclusively by Play Pals,

51
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,545
makers of Good Guys and other fine toys.

52
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,174
Found in toy stores throughout the greater Chicago area.

53
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,596
Mommy, wake up.

54
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,892
Mommy.

55
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:50,612
Mommy, wake up.

56
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,823
- Wake up, Mommy. Wake up.
- Andy.

57
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,120
What time is it, Andy?

58
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,205
Wake up.

59
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,041
6:30. It's only 6:30 in the morning.

60
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,340
But it's a beautiful day outside. See?

61
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,969
lt certainly is.

62
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,012
How long you been up, birthday boy?

63
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,681
Since forever.

64
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,268
I made you breakfast in bed.

65
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,019
You did? Oh, God.

66
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,814
Well, thanks.

67
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,109
Well, this looks just excellent.

68
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,030
Oh, I'll tell you what.

69
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,366
Why don't I eat this just a little later, okay?

70
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,701
Mmm-hmm.

71
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,747
But first, I gotta give you your super-duper ，birthday tummy-gummy.
首先，我先给你一个超级生日礼物

72
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,417
Come here. Come here. Come here.

73
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,964
- That's one. How many years old are you today?
- Two.

74
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,383
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

75
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,470
Thanks. Can we open my presents now, Mommy?

76
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,972
Yes, we can.

77
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,348
Terrific!

78
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,769
FEMALE ANNOUNCER ON TV: Good morning, Chicago. Leading off at this hour,

79
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,648
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lake Shore Strangler was shot and killed

80
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,068
shortly before 3:00 a.m. this morning on Wabash Avenue.

81
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,405
Can I open this first, Mommy? Can I, can I?

82
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,992
Andy, don't you want to start with the smaller one first?

83
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,703
Okay, go ahead.

84
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,838
Well, what do you think? You need these clothes so badly.

85
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,340
Hey, I think they're gonna be okay.

86
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,384
We'll just have to take them up just a couple of inches.

87
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,388
What's the matter?

88
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,723
Nothing.

89
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,143
Oh, I know. You want some toys, don't you?

90
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,145
Not boring old clothes.

91
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,357
Try the other one.

92
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,446
Well, what do you think?

93
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,907
I want a Good Guy to go with it.

94
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,450
I know you do, Andy.

95
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,620
But I didn't know about it in time this month to save up for it.

96
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,547
- Karen.
- Hi.

97
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,341
You know that doll that you wanted for Andy?

98
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,176
- The one that costs 100 bucks?
- Yeah, the Good Guy doll.

99
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,178
There is a peddler in the alley behind the store,

100
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,513
and I think he's got one.

101
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,931
What? What would a peddler be doing with a doll?

102
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,517
Who cares? Would you grab your purse and come on? We can get a deal on it.

103
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,601
But I can't just leave my counter.

104
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,019
Do you want the damn doll or don't you?

105
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,105
- Of course I do.
- Well, then, come on.

106
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,398
- Come on.
- All right.

107
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,319
There he is.

108
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,950
Okay, show her.

109
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,455
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?

110
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,708
lt is. lt is.

111
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,084
Yeah, well, I told you.

112
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,335
How much do you want for it?

113
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,378
50 bucks.

114
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,921
- 10 and not a penny more.
- 30.

115
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,132
What, are you kidding? That thing is not worth $30.

116
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,426
Enough. Take it or leave it. Somebody else will buy it.

117
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,553
- I'll take it.
- Karen, it's too much money.

118
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,888
No, it isn't. You have no idea how much Andy wants this doll.

119
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,724
But we don't even know if the damn thing works.

120
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,727
Here you go, lady. May it bring you and your kid a lot of joy.

121
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,936
KAREN: Thank you.

122
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,688
Hey, hold on, you!

123
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,482
How do we know the damn thing isn't stolen?

124
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,900
Steal this.

125
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,318
MAGGIE: Steal this yourself.

126
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,570
(LAUGHING) Maggie.

127
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,904
I think I dated him.

128
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,032
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

129
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,205
Andy's gonna love it!

130
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,417
Mrs. Barclay, so nice of you to drop by. Have a nice break?

131
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Criswell. I was only gone for a minute.

132
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,086
Have a heart, Criswell.

133
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,630
We were just downstairs buying her little boy a birthday present.

134
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,092
We have specified break times for activities like that, Miss Peterson.

135
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,636
Mrs. Howe has taken sick, and we're shorthanded tonight.

136
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,305
You'll have to fill in for her.

137
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,849
I can't. I have to pick up my son at the day care center in an hour.

138
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,434
I'm sorry, this is an emergency.

139
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,019
Wait a second. I'll take over for her.

140
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,773
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes, not in jewelry.

141
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,399
You'll just simply have to do it.

142
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,776
Now, you can take off at 5:00,

143
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,861
but you'll have to be back at 7:00.

144
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,321
It's my son's birthday.

145
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,324
Mrs. Barclay, are you happy with your job here?

146
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,408
Yes, of course I am.

147
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,285
- Then I suggest that...
- Hey.

148
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,537
Chill out, would you, Walter?

149
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,831
I'll take care of Andy for you.

150
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,999
Maggie, you can't do it again.

151
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,252
Don't be silly. It'll be the hottest date I've had in months.

152
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,087
I can't imagine why.

153
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,973
Hey, where are you going?

154
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,975
Good Guys are on TV.

155
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,770
Well, I may have something better for you.

156
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,146
What?

157
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,025
This isn't groceries.

158
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,124
A Good Guy! I knew it!

159
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,460
I knew you'd get me one.

160
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,587
Show me how he works, okay?

161
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,842
Hi, I'm Andy. What's your name?

162
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:09,389
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend to the end. Hidey-ho.

163
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,810
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

164
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,604
Oh, Mom, thanks.

165
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,608
You're welcome, honey.

166
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,754
See, that's how you build things.

167
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,090

More details to follow on the news at 9:00 next.

171
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,856
Hey, Chucky, you're not watching me.

172
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,402
Hey, wanna play?

173
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,154
Hey, it's time for bed, Andy.

174
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,157
MAN ON TV: No, sir. Never saw the little swab before.

175
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,952
Come on, Chucky. We have to get ready to go to bed.

176
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,956
BOY ON TV: I'm not a stowaway. Mr. Ghoo brought me here.

MAN: And who might Mr. Apple be?

178
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:28,509
Aunt Maggie, Chucky wants to watch the 9:00 news.

179
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,553
Sure he does.

180
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,308
Okay, kid, off we go.

181
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,226
Come on. There we go.

182
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,772
Chucky.

183
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,607
Oh, yes, Chucky.

184
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,319
You, too. Off we go.

185
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,076
Now, it's brush your teeth and under the covers with you.

186
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,205
Okay? Agreed?

187
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,832
Good. Okay.

188
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,044
You yell when you're ready for me to tuck you in.

189
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,216
Hey, Chucky, want to see my room?

190
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,484
Andy, are you brushing your teeth?

191
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,403
Yes, Aunt Maggie.

192
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,405
Good.

193
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,956
ANNOUNCER ON TV: And now, Action News at 9:00.

194
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,043
TERRY: ln Washington today,

195
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,169
the mayor replied

196
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,339
that he would study the congressional findings carefully

197
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,760
and have the commission on gang-related violence issue recommendations to him.

198
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,595
Back to you, Steve.

199
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,597
STEVE: Thank you, Terry.

200
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,017
In other news, police have now clarified the information

201
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,102
regarding the escape of Eddie Caputo.

202
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,479
Authorities say that Caputo managed to elude his captors

203
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,442
while being transferred onto a prison bus on his way to court. Of course...

204
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,619
Okay, mister, what do you have to say about this?

205
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,704
About what?

206
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,247
Come on. Come on.

207
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,211
You know, you have to learn that when I say something, I mean it.

208
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,172
But what did I do?

209
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,965
You know what I'm talking about.

210
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,551
Turning the TV on and putting Chucky in front of it

211
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,054
when I told you it was time to go to bed.

212
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,180
I didn't do that.

213
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,681
Oh, no? What did Chucky do?

214
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,934
Walk into the living room and turn it on all by himself?

215
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,811
Did you do that, Chucky?

216
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,231
Andy, stop it. Now, come on, under the covers. Hurry.

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,150
But, Auntie...

218
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,986
Under the covers and not another word.

219
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,531
But I didn't put Chucky in front of the TV.

220
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,867
Enough. Okay?

221
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,536
Give me a kiss.

222
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,748
Good night, baby, and happy birthday.

223
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,833
Good night, Aunt Maggie.

224
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,687
I told you she'd be mad at you if you watched the news.

225
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,755
MAN ON TV: I missed you, my dear.

226
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,091
I was afraid you weren't going to show up.

227
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,552
Too bad about the accident.

228
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,847
WOMAN ON TV: Yes. Papa told us they just found it.

229
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,181
How did you know?

230
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,641
MAN: I must have heard it somewhere.

231
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,518
WOMAN: I haven't seen you in so long, darling.

232
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,854
I mean, couldn't we take a little walk, or something?

233
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,314
lt looks as though you haven't had a breath of fresh air in days.

234
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,732
MAN: A walk?
WOMAN: Of course.

235
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,317
The air outside will do you good.

236
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,153
Besides, you'll work up an appetite.

237
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,237
Please.

238
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,905
MAN: But, Janice, surely it's going to rain.

239
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,973
Andy?

240
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,517
MAN: Depends on whether there's an indictment.

241
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,769
WOMAN: Well, they don't always...

242
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,637
Andy, is that you?

243
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,775
How did that happen?

244
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,903
Uh... Hello?

245
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,239
Hi. How's it going? How's Andy?

246
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,158
MAGGIE: Karen?

247
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,744
Yeah. Who else would it be? ls something wrong?

248
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,287
Uh...

249
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,413
No.

250
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,083
Everything's fine.

251
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,670
Are you sure? You don't sound like everything's fine.

252
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:24,383
No, I just had a bit of the alone-at-night willies. You know?

253
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,261
Now, would you stop worrying

254
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,014
and give Criswell a kick in the pants for me?

255
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,516
You got it.

256
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,852
Hey, listen, Maggie. Thank you for everything.

257
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,520
You're a real pal.

258
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,022
Oh, yeah?

259
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,858
Yeah, yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me, will you?

260
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,318
See you soon. Bye.

261
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,942
What is wrong with me?

262
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,945
I'm scaring myself half to death.

263
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,935
POLICEMAN 1: Step away from this barricade.

264
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,855
Come on, move it back. There's nothing to see.

265
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,940
POLICEMAN 2: Now, let's move this police line back here.

266
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,025
Go on home, folks, please.

267
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,289
DETECTIVE: She was on the sixth floor.

268
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,385
Miss, what do you think you're doing?

269
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,887
I live here.

270
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,519
Andy?

271
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,315
Oh, no. Andy?

272
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,026
Andy?

273
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,236
Andy!

274
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,488
Mommy!

275
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,781
Oh, thank God.

276
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,618
Are you all right?

277
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,370
Oh, I'm so glad. I got so scared when I...

278
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,706
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

279
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,417
She had an accident.

280
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,169
Accident? What kind of an accident?

281
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,380
Mrs. Barclay, I'm Detective Mike Norris, Homicide.

282
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,549
Could I talk to you out in the hall?

283
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,009
Why? What's happened to Maggie?

284
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,385
Please?

285
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,431
I'll be right back.

286
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,483
Look, Mrs. Barclay...

287
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,908
What?

288
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,118
Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.

289
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,370
What?

290
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,499
How?

291
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,292
She fell from your kitchen window.

292
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,294
Oh, no.

293
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,423
You all right?

294
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,842
Yes. All right.

295
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,386
Come on.

296
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,392
Oh, Maggie.

297
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,394
Did you check over here?

298
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,315
Oh, Maggie.

299
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,489
You got any idea what these are?

300
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,662
No.

301
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,916
MIKE: They look like footprints, don't they? Very small footprints.

302
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,669
What are you implying?

303
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,629
I don't know.

304
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,590
What would Andy be doing up on the counter, right?

305
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,632
- What?
- Besides,

306
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,303
I already checked his closet. None of his shoes matched these prints.

307
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,306
Mommy? Mommy?

308
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,350
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

309
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,476
Andy, I want you to go to bed.

310
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,103
The detective and I are very busy.

311
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,229
But, Mom...

312
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,731
Right now, please.

313
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,026
MIKE: Andy.

314
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,528
What do you got on your feet?

315
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,282
Good Guy PJ sneakers.

316
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,284
Wow. Come here.

317
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,455
Can I see the bottoms of them?

318
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,706
Sure.

319
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,960
Look at this. There's a gun. Is that a cowboy hat?

320
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,213
Andy, get into bed. I'll be in in a minute to tuck you in.

321
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,215
- But, Mom...
- Right now.

322
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,640
Why are you treating Andy like this?

323
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,268
If he says he doesn't know how those footprints got there, then he doesn't.

324
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,312
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those footprints.

325
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,396
If not Andy, then who?

326
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,440
I don't know, and I don't care.

327
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,360
All I know is that I've just lost my best friend tonight to a horrible accident

328
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,944
and I would like some time alone with my son,

329
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,113
who I'm sure is just as upset about this as I am.

330
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,824
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

331
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,078
I'll clear everybody out of here right away. Okay?

332
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,997
Hey, guys, you done? Let's go. Chop-chop.

333
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,208
Let's go, everybody. Out of here.

334
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,168
POLICEMAN 1: Let's clear this up over here. Come on.

335
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,336
POLICEMAN 2: Okay.

336
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,088
POLICEMAN 3: Let's go, Sid.

337
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:04,473
What do you think was so important about my sneakers, Chucky?

338
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,893
You don't know either, do you?

339
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,041
Well, let me know if you find out anything about those footprints.

340
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,626
Mommy, Mommy.

341
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,337
Mommy, I know who was on the kitchen counter. I know, I know.

342
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,631
- Andy, I thought I...
- Who, Andy? Who?

343
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,966
Chucky!

344
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,801
Your doll?

345
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,137
KAREN: Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.

346
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,098
Now, come on, back to bed. Now I mean it.

347
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,558
But, Mom...

348
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,731
Good night, Detective.

349
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,610
- What?
- Are you gonna call me?

350
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,112
You don't give up, do you?

351
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,656
I just...I hate loose ends.

352
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,200
And I hate people who don't know when to stop.

353
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,578
Ouch.

354
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,871
A spirited lady.

355
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,330
No kidding.

356
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,040
I want that autopsy report on my desk

357
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,459
- first thing tomorrow.
- Yeah.

358
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,253
And anything you can find out about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

359
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,006
You got it. Anything else I can do for you, sir?

360
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,843
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

361
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,511
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

362
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,596
What is this?

363
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,055
Possible murder weapon.

364
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
No.

365
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,351
Come on. You're kidding me.

366
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,606
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

367
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,447
ANDY: 'Cause she saw you walking and talking?

368
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,880
I guess there was no hiding from her.

369
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,011
Andy, who are you talking to?

370
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,304
Chucky.

371
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,609
Chucky, huh?

372
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,736
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

373
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,072
He's sitting right over there.

374
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,411
Chucky's been talking to you, too, hasn't he?

375
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,663
What's he been saying?

376
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,290
All kinds of things.

377
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,794
His real name is Charles Lee Ray,

378
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:43,966
and he's been sent down from heaven by Daddy to play with me.

379
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,682
He has, has he? Anything else?

380
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,769
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie was a real bitch

381
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,896
and got what she deserved.

382
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,859
Andy, how can you say something so horrible?

383
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,611
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

384
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,321
Andy, stop it.

385
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,782
You know perfectly well that you're making this up.

386
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,661
But I'm not. Chucky's alive. Really, he is.

387
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,747
Andy, Chucky... Chucky's a doll.

388
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,375
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

389
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,002
Look at him. Look at him.

390
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,045
Now, does he look like anything else to you?

391
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,755
Don't, you'll hurt him.

392
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,257
Andy, look!

393
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,511
Now you don't really think that Chucky is alive, do you?

394
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,013
But he is.

395
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,640
Andy, stop it. Please.

396
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:39,438
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie you're yelling at me, isn't it?

397
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,777
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

398
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,821
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,699
I'll stop making up stories.

400
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,539
Thanks, champ.

401
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,335
Do you wanna sleep in with me tonight?

402
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,378
No, it's all right.

403
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,672
I've got Chucky.

404
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,094
Come on, into bed.

405
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,393
Good night, sweetheart.

406
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,855
I love you.

407
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,029
Good night.

408
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,751
You're right, Chucky. She didn't believe me.

409
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,635
Hi. I like to be hugged.

410
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,973
Good. I'd love to hug you, too.

411
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,530
Hey.

412
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,533
You sure you're all right about last night?

413
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,994
No bad dreams about Aunt Maggie?

414
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,997
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

415
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,835
All right, off to school with you, then. I love you tons.

416
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,371
MAN ON PA: 43rd street. Next stop, 47th.

417
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,342
Is that Eddie's?

418
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,642
Look, you stay here. I have to go tinkle.

419
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,114
I'll be right there, Chucky.

420
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,651
Chucky?

421
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:23,550
Chucky?

422
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:44,446
Chucky?

423
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,512
Mrs. Barclay.

424
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,474
Detective Norris, I came as soon as I got your message.

425
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,059
You haven't been to the school to pick up your son yet?

426
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,853
No. No, I came directly from work. Why?

427
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,104
Let's go into my office.

428
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,857
Is something wrong with Andy?

429
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,317
Please.

430
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,945
I...

431
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,285
I don't know how to tell you this, Mrs. Barclay.

432
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,828
Tell me what?

433
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,290
Do you have any idea why your Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

434
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,541
Yes.

435
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,502
Could you tell me why?

436
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:46,007
'Cause she saw Chucky, and it scared her so much, she fell out.

437
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,717
Oh, she did, huh?

438
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,137
(DOOR OPENING) So why did Chucky go to see Eddie Caputo?

439
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,472
Mommy!

440
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,182
Oh, Andy.

441
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,438
All right, sweetheart. Come on.

442
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,609
Now listen to me, okay?

443
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,321
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

444
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,200
Unless you start telling the truth right now,

445
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,371
They're going to take you away from me.

446
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,625
You hear that, Chucky?

447
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,837
They're taking me away unless you say something.

448
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,508
Please, say something.

449
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,846
Come on, Chucky. Say something.

450
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,433
Tell me why you lied to me about everything.

451
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,769
Come on, Chucky. Say something.

452
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,688
Tell me.

453
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:46,276
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend to the end. Hidey-ho.

454
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,573
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose.

455
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:56,035
He told me never to tell about him or he'd kill me.

456
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,873
Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore. I'm from County General.

457
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,125
I've seen more than enough.

458
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,587
Maybe Andy should spend a couple of days with us.

459
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,504
Well, say something, you little bastard.

460
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,299
Say something, damn it!

461
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,677
Hi. I like to be hugged.

462
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,888
"He wants you for a best friend."

463
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,598
Yeah, sure.

464
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,784
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

465
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,974
Talk to me.

466
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,936
Come on, talk.

467
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,399
I said, talk to me, damn it. All right.

468
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,235
Then I'm gonna make you talk!

469
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,710
I said talk to me, damn it, or else I am gonna throw you in the fire!

470
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,462
You stupid bitch! You filthy slut!

471
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,089
I'll teach you to fuck with me!

472
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,382
No! No!

473
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,297
Stop!

474
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:37,960
No.

475
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,465
No!

476
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,310
Oh, Detective Norris!

477
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,103
Mrs. Barclay, what are you doing back here?

478
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,647
Andy was telling the truth.

479
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,107
Chucky is alive and he killed Eddie Caputo.

480
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,235
- What?
- I took him home to my apartment.

481
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,197
I was about to throw away the box that he came in when the batteries fell out.

482
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,365
Don't you see?

483
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,743
He's been moving and talking for days without any batteries in him.

484
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,036
What are you talking about?

485
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,830
How I found out the doll was alive.

486
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,290
See, I threatened to throw him into the fireplace,

487
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,960
when all of a sudden, he came alive in my hand.

488
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,129
I dropped him, and he got up and ran out of the apartment.

489
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,590
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

490
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,760
Wait a minute. I am telling you the truth.

491
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,512
He killed Maggie. He killed Eddie Caputo.

492
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,013
Look, Mrs. Barclay.

493
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,932
I sympathize with you. I really do.

494
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,851
I hated what happened in there today.

495
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,644
But lying is not gonna help your son.

496
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,855
Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?

497
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,691
How did you get those?

498
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,942
Chucky bit me.

499
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,778
Oh, for God's sake.

500
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,030
All right, don't believe me.

501
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,533
Where you going?

502
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,951
To find Chucky.

503
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,244
How you gonna do that?

504
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,663
I bought him from a peddler where I work. I'll start there.

505
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,291
That isn't a good part of town to be in at this time of night.

506
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,209
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?

507
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,212
You don't want to go down there at this time of night.

508
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,719
God damn it.

509
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,237
Uh-huh.

510
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,545
What's she doing here?

511
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,635
Hey, excuse me.

512
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,974
Mister.

513
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,810
I'm not gonna hurt you. Do you remember me?

514
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,852
No, no.

515
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,062
I'm sorry. I bought a doll from you

516
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,314
in back of Carson's department store with my friend yesterday.

517
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,274
- Doll?
- Yes, a Good Guy doll.

518
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,151
You sold it to me. Do you remember?

519
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,987
Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

520
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,613
Where did you get it?

521
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,865
What will you give me if I tell you?

522
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,829
I don't have much, but you're welcome to whatever I have.

523
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,917
It's not enough. What else you got?

524
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,003
That's all I've got.

525
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,337
All you got?

526
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,839
What are you... Yes.

527
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,507
That's not all you got.

528
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,050
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

529
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,302
No. No, no.

530
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,472
(SCREAMING) No. Wait. No, no!

531
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,598
Pig!

532
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,642
Christ, he's a cop!

533
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,686
All right. What about the rest of you?

534
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,521
You wanna party, too?

535
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,488
All right. Now, you want to answer the lady's question now?

536
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,490
Where did you get the doll from?

537
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,242
I don't know nothing about no doll.

538
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,077
You're not gonna know nothing about nothing in a minute,

539
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,537
unless you talk to me. Now talk!

540
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:45,166
A burned-out toy store on Wabash. That's where I got it.

541
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,919
Get out of here.

542
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,465
What's wrong?

543
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,967
Nothing.

544
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,388
Well, wait a minute. Something the peddler said upset you. What was it?

545
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,474
I just told you, nothing.

546
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,978
God damn it. My son's life is at stake. Now, what was it?

547
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:11,233
The place where he said he got the doll, Charles Lee Ray died there.

548
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,401
Who?

549
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,655
The Lake Shore Strangler. The man who's partners with Eddie Caputo.

550
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,033
Hey. Where are you going now?

551
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,159
Wabash and Van Buren.

552
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,661
There's nothing there. It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

553
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,788
Why don't you believe me?

554
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:27,166
It was struck by lightning the night that Charles Lee Ray died.

555
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,252
How do you know that?

556
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,547
Because I was there. I was the man who killed him.

557
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,181
Why didn't you tell me?

558
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,352
It's not exactly the kind of thing you tell someone.

559
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,147
Come on, let me take you home. You need some sleep.

560
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,941
Did he say anything? Anything at all?

561
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,192
- Who?
- Charles Lee Ray.

562
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,362
Yeah. He threatened to kill me and Eddie Caputo.

563
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,962
I'm sorry you couldn't find anything to help Andy.

564
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,630
I really am.

565
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,840
But I did.

566
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,134
I found out that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

567
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,887
The only thing I don't know is how he got inside the doll.

568
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,431
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

569
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,392
Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

570
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,520
Look, please, will you just get out of the car?

571
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,397
Hey, just tell me where he lived.

572
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,608
Don't you understand? Andy's life depends on it.

573
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,444
730 Stoney Island, the south side.

574
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,029
But I've already checked the place out.

575
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,407
There's nothing there. Now, good night.

576
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,160
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

577
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,620
- Home, to get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that.

578
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,165
Don't you see? You just said it.

579
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,667
Chucky killed Caputo. That leaves you.

580
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,710
That does it.

581
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,253
Oh, please listen to me.

582
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,592
Out.

583
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,010
I am telling you the truth.

584
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,178
Why won't you believe me?

585
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,222
Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay. Sane and rational.

586
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,185
All right. All right.

587
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,311
Do you remember what you said

588
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,604
the first night you met me in my apartment?

589
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,522
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.

590
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,607
Well, I'm a loose end.

591
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,484
You can't just let go what I said tonight without checking it out.

592
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,820
For the last time, Mrs. Barclay, good night.

593
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,609

MAN: Jeez, look out!

601
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,865
Hi, Mikey.

602
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,960
Won't do you any good, Mikey. You can't hurt me.

603
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,771
(SCREAMS) Karen.

604
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,486
What are you doing here?

605
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,697
After I talked to you last night,

606
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,326
I decided to go back to the station and pull Ray's file.

607
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,286
I learned a couple of things.

608
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,121
His nickname was Chucky,

609
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,459
and he spent a lot of time with this man.

610
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,635
Now, all we have to do is find him before Chucky does.

611
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,895
CHUCKY: Hello, John.

612
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,440
Over here.

613
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,484
Hi.

614
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,028
It's me. Chucky.

615
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,991
What do you think? The grigri work?

616
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,788
You know, when I came here learning all that stuff about how to beat death,

617
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,457
I thought maybe you were pulling my chain.

618
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,793
But not now. Not now.

619
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,462
Only one problem.

620
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,672
What?

621
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,384
This. I didn't think anybody could hurt me.

622
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,886
But last night, I got shot.

623
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,764
You know something? It hurt.

624
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,767
It hurt like a son of a bitch. It even bled.

625
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,020
Now why's that, John?

626
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,938
You're turning human.

627
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,189
What?

628
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,693
The more time you spend in that body,

629
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,196
the more human you'll become.

630
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,826
You mean I have to live out the rest of my life in this body?

631
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,997
No fucking way. You got me into this, you get me out.

632
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,375
I can't do that, Chucky.

633
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,752
Why not?

634
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,379
Because you're an abomination,

635
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,799
an outrage against nature.

636
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,888
You perverted everything I've taught you and used it for evil.

637
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,765
And you have to be stopped.

638
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,480
You know, I thought something like this might happen.

639
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,231
That's why I prepared for it.

640
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,816
What are you talking about?

641
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,527
Your own personal mojo, doc.

642
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,946
Give me that.

643
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,240
Sure. How do you want it? Broken leg?

644
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,873
Shouldn't tell your customers where you hide things like this, John.

645
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,334
Gets you in trouble every time.

646
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,961
Now how do I get out of this body?

647
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,005
No, I won't tell you.

648
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,090
Yeah?

649
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,221
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.

650
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,473
No, I'll tell you.

651
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,229
You have to transfer your soul out of the doll

652
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:36,400
into that of the first human being you revealed your true self to.

653
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:41,154
You mean the first person I let in on the fact that I was really alive?

654
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,493
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

655
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:50,706
The first person I let in on my little secret was a six-year-old kid.

656
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,208
I'm gonna be six years old again.

657
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:57,045
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.

658
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,298
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.

659
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,344
And you have a date with death.

660
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,766
So long, John.

661
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,793
Hold it. Wait, wait.

662
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,969
Oh, my God.

663
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,057
- Too late.
- What?

664
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,436
Must save the boy. Must...

665
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,232
Must get his soul

666
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,069
into him like he got into doll.

667
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,571
What?

668
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:08,575
You must stop him before he can say the chant.

669
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,037
Kill him before he can say it.

670
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,872
But how? How?

671
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:18,919
The heart. His heart is almost human.

672
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,591
It's the only way. Through the heart.

673
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:46,404
Help me! Help me! Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

674
01:03:56,582 --> 01:04:01,002
Help me! He's coming to kill me! He's here. Chucky's here.

675
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,963
I don't see anybody.

676
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,050
But, Doctor, Chucky's here,

677
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,302
and he's going to kill me.

678
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:16,768
But Chucky is here, and he's going to kill me!

679
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,691
He's going to kill me.

680
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,861
Please don't leave me. Please.

681
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:19,915
No!

682
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,586
ARDMORE: Andy, stop.

683
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,754
ATTENDANT: Hey, wait a minute.

684
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,130
Stop him!

685
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,187
MAN: Check the north corridor.

686
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,193
Easy. Easy, it's all right, Andy. It's all right.

687
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:33,071
You're not gonna need this anymore, all right?

688
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,325
But I do. Chucky's in the room, and he's trying to kill me.

689
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,828
No, Andy. It's gonna be all right. I'm here now.

690
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,579
And I'm gonna protect you.

691
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,708
Andy. Easy, boy. Easy.

692
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,835
Come on, nobody's here.

693
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,503
No, please. He'll kill you, too.

694
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,671
Andy, now...

695
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,841
No, please. Listen to me. Please.

696
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,302
Andy, now this is just gonna sting you for one second.

697
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:15,113
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

698
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,036
Stop.

699
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:39,721
What happened?

700
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,057
Look, miss, could you just excuse us for a minute here, all right?

701
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,224
What?

702
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,520
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

703
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:50,857
Fried him to a crisp with the electric shock machine and then he escaped.

704
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,567
Escaped? Where?

705
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,820
We don't know, but I bet she does.

706
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,578
Chucky. You seen Chucky anywhere?

707
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,206
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

708
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,665
The same one that was at the station house.

709
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,375
Have you seen him anywhere?

710
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,253
What am I gonna know about a doll? Where are you going?

711
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:16,925
They think Andy did it.

712
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,676
I know, the girl said that Chucky was here,

713
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,386
and that he was looking for Andy.

714
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,222
- But where would Andy go?
- He'd go home.

715
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,932
I always told him to go there if he was in trouble.

716
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,892
- Does he have a key?
- It's under the mat.

717
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,060
Come on. Come on. We don't have much time.

718
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,587
Look, George.

719
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,589
Some child left their doll in the elevator.

720
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:57,674
Leave it alone.

721
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,552
Whoever left it there will come back looking for it.

722
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,267
Ugly doll.

723
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,562
CHUCKY: Fuck you.

724
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,167
(SHOUTS) Surprise!

725
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,783
Batter up!

726
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,580
Give me the power, I beg of you.

727
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:40,688
KAREN: Andy!

728
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,482
MIKE: Andy!
KAREN: Andy!

729
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,317
MIKE: Andy, can you hear me?

730
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,657
KAREN: Andy!

731
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:53,993
Andy!

732
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,042
Stop! Ow!

733
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:02,960
KAREN: Andy.

734
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,797
MIKE: Karen, Karen, are you all right?

735
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:10,968
Oh, Mike.

736
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,054
Just take care of Andy.

737
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,726
Karen, Karen.

738
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,561
Take this. Take it.

739
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,729
Mike!

740
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,316
Mommy.

741
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,545
CHUCKY: What's wrong? Gun jammed?

742
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:07,210
Andy!

743
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,712
Andy, help me. The matches.

744
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,672
Andy!

745
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,174
Please! Now!

746
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,021
Andy, no, please.

747
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,691
We're friends to the end. Remember?

748
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:34,237
This is the end, friend.

749
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,283
Oh, my baby.

750
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,159
MIKE: Karen? Andy?

751
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,203
You all right?

752
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,129
Andy, go get me the first-aid kit

753
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,256
under the kitchen sink really fast. Okay?

754
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,424
What happened?

755
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,843
Oh, God. Chucky's dead.

756
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,899
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

757
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,777
KAREN: Andy, hurry up.

758
01:16:58,196 --> 01:16:59,280
Andy.

759
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,087
Hello, Andy.

760
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:21,469
Mommy.

761
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,221
Mommy!

762
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,311
Give me the boy, and I'll let you live.

763
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,855
Do you hear me? Give me the boy.

764
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:57,755
Mommy!

765
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,540
CHUCKY: Give me the boy.

766
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:43,569
JOHN: What the hell's going on here?

767
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:45,237
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

768
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:46,238
MIKE: Karen.

769
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,490
God！

770
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:55,915
Oh, Jesus.

771
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,796
JOHN: Yeah, I got a cop down here. Multiple stab wounds.

772
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,673
The Brewster Apartments on North Grand Street. Make it fast.

773
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:08,135
All right, they're gonna be here in 10 minutes. Now, tell me what happened.

774
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,763
The kid was right. The doll's alive.

775
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,681
He almost got the three of us.

776
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,100
Come on, what are you talking about?

777
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,854
You don't believe me? All right, well, go on. Check it out in the hall.

778
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,523
It's scattered all over the place.

779
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,983
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?

780
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,443
Don't you touch one part of it!

781
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,362
All right, look. Take it easy, okay?

782
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:29,031
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.

783
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:10,072
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look at this thing, okay?

784
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,616
Because there's no way this thing's alive.

785
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,578
I thought I told you not to touch it.

786
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,371
Mike, will you be sensible?

787
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:19,665
Come on, look. It's as dead as they come. It's dead.

788
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,711
CHUCKY: Choke him! Kill him!

789
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,380
I'll rip his throat out.

790
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,966
Kill him!

791
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,303
Kill him.

792
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:41,312
Kill him now! Strangle him! Don't let go!

793
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:47,776
JOHN: God.

794
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:59,163
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

795
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,957
The heart. Shoot him in the heart.

796
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,193
Hi, I'm Chucky.

797
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:34,031
Wanna play?

798
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,292
You believe me now?

799
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,543
Yeah.

800
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,048
But who's gonna believe me?

801
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:57,388
Come on.

802
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,725
All right. Ready? Here we go.

803
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:08,857
Come on.

804
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,205
Andy.

805
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:26,667
Come on. We're gonna go to the hospital with Mike.

806
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,168
Let's go.
