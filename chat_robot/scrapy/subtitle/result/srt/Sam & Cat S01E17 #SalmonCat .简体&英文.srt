All right, now, let me just get my jump rope ready.

2
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,510
你真想让我们冲你打网球吗
You sure you want us to hit tennis balls at you?

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,780
是哒
Oh yeah.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,980
为啥

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,520
因为如果你们往我身上打球
Because if I'm really good at

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,250
那我该是有多厉害啊
Imagine how great I'll be when you're not.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,780
你们真是俩奇葩保姆
You guys are weird babysitters.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,320
等你看我们喂你啥就知道了
Wait'll you see what we feed you.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,040

嘿  馊主意 馊主意啊
Hey, bad idea! Bad idea!

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,260

It was a bad idea!

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,890
-叮咚  -你去开门
- Ding dong. - You'll get it.

我是马丁・马洛伊
My name is Martin Malloy.

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,840
-哦  -我是个律师
- Ooh! - I'm a lawyer.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,060
律师
A lawyer?

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,100
是有关我妈的吧  她进监狱了没
Is this about my Mom? Is she in jail?

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,150
她又去教堂裸奔啦
Did she go to church naked again?

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,210
-我不认识你妈  -呃 那就好
- I don't know your Mother. - Ugh, must be nice.

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,750
进来吧马丁・马洛伊先生
Why don't you come in, Mr. Marty Malloy?

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,450
非常感谢
Thank you.

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,150
到底什么事
What's this about?

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,510
你俩是不是经营一个叫...
Do you two run a business called...

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,490
莎姆和小猫的超级炫酷轻松愉快宝贝看护服务的
Sam and Cat's super rockin' fun-time Babysitting Service?

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,890
那又怎样
Why?

33
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,190
看这张纸
Take these papers.

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,560
唔 装订好的
Ooh, stapled.

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,410
-这是份制止令 -嘿
- That's a cease and desist order. - Hey!

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,960
麻烦讲英语
Talk English, man.

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,870
好吧  我再说清楚点
Fine, I'll be more clear.

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,750
把你们的宝贝看护服务名称改掉
Change the name of your Babysitting Service.

39
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,170
你们无权使用“莎姆和小猫”这个名称
You're not allowed to use the names Sam and Cat.

40
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,720
-啥  -可这是我们的名字啊
- What? - But those are our names.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,150
这也是1970年起就超受欢迎的儿童剧名字
It's also the name of a popular kids' TV show from the 1970s.

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,210
什么儿童剧
What TV show?

43
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,550
鲑鱼猫
Salmon Cat.

44
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,770
-什么鲑鱼猫  -这个鲑鱼猫
- Salmon Cat? - Salmon Cat.

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,760
这是布偶
That's a puppet.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,120
叫鲑鱼猫的布偶
A puppet named Salmon Cat.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,080
看见没  它是半猫半鱼的
Look, he's half cat, half salmon.

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,710
但它是条鱼
That's a fish.

49
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,350
噢  这么个鲑鱼猫
Oh. Salmon Cat.

50
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,000
可我们是莎姆和小猫  不是什么诡异的鱼猫布偶
But we're Sam and Cat, not some weirdo mutant fish puppet.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,580
鲑鱼猫是儿童剧
Salmon Cat was a show for children.

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,510
你们两个经营保姆业务
You two run a Babysitting Service for children.

53
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,910
鲑鱼猫  莎姆和小猫
Salmon Cat. Sam and Cat.

54
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,400
很明显会搞混的
Obviously, that's confusing.

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,370
真的会搞混耶
It is confusing.

56
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,640
你都能把吐司搞混
You think toast is confusing.

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,120
才不是呢  我原来是会搞混
No. I used to think it was confusing,

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,110
但自从我读了那本吐司书之后就豁然开朗了
but then I read that book about toast and now I get it.

59
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,970
你们的宝贝看护服务
You girls must stop using Sam

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,050
必须停止使用莎姆和小猫这个名词
and Cat in the name of your Babysitting Service.

61
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,370
但这名字已经注册网站了
But it's already on our website

62
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,320
名片上也是  我还定做了T恤衫
and on our business cards. I ordered T-shirts.

63
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,940
小猫
Cat!

64
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,980
我来搞定
I got this.

65
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,590
她拿着个网球拍做什么
Why is she holding a tennis racket?

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,520
我猜她要冲你打球
I think she's going to hit you with balls.

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,290
慢着  我可是个律师...
Wait, I am a lawyer and I...

68
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,640
瞄准嘴巴发射
Ball in the hole!

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,660
噢 
Oh!

70
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,760
唔..唔唔
Mm! Mm!

71
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,330
现在我要来个吐司
Now I want toast.

72
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,800
我去拿那本书
I'll get my book.

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,280
一二三四五六七八
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,970
各就各位  预备  走着
Schlemeel! Schlemazel! Hasenfeffer Incorporated.

75
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,310
好吧  等一下  你们是说
Okay, wait a minute, you're saying

76
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,360
昨天一个律师突然来你们公寓了
a lawyer just showed up at your apartment yesterday?

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,760
是啊  而且他说我们不能用
Yeah. And he said we're not allowed to use the names,

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,170
莎姆和小猫这个名字了
Sam and Cat anymore for our Babysitting Service.

79
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,730
可是为什么啊
But why?

80
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,350
因为原来有个
Because there used to be

81
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,570
愚蠢的儿童布偶剧叫鲑鱼猫的
some stupid puppet show on TV called Salmon Cat.

82
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,110
哎呀  谁想听我讲
Say, who wants to hear about

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,810
我当年看鲑鱼猫的快乐时光
the time I was having a salmon dinner at Chasens?

84
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,150
-没人想  -我不听
- Nobody. - Not I.

85
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,680
-好吧  -你好  食物还满意吗
- Well! - Hello. Are you enjoying your foods?

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,190
-嗯 很棒 -是的 谢谢你
- Mm, great. - Yes, thank you.

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
我的薯条还没来啊
Except I didn't get my curly fries.

88
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,360
噢不是吧
Oh no!

89
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,220
对不起我忘记了
I'm sorry, I forgot.

90
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,530
噢 他忘了你的薯条
Oh, he forgot your fries?

91
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,300
就像他忘了我的生日一样
Like he forgot my birthday?

92
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,230
在人类面前能不能收敛点
Can we please not do this in front of the humans?

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,840
呃 你俩在一起了吗
Uh, are you two dating?

94
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,570

No. No. No.

95
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,140
她不是我喜欢的类型
She's not my type.

96
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,510
圣诞派对上我还是你喜欢的类型呢
I was your type at the Christmas party.

97
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,330
就那么一次
That was one time.

Hey kids, it's time for the wet and wacky world of Salmon Cat.

101

Today's episode is about...

102
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060

Sharing.

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,730
呃...这真是..
Ugh, this is...

104
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,830

Torture.

105
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,240
嘘  我喜欢看
Shh, I like it.

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,770
喵喵喵
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

107
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,560
我有一大袋子糖果耶
I got a whole bag of candy.

108
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,130
哼哼哼
Oink, oink, oink.

109
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,660

Hi there, Salmon Cat.

110
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,670
你好啊八爪猪
Hi there, Octopiggy.

111
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,410
-能给我些糖吗  -不行
- Can I have some candy? - No.

112
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,400
可我希望你能给我分享些糖果
But I was hoping you would share some of your candy with me.

113
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,780
好了 这垃圾老娘再也看不下去了
Okay, I can't watch any more of this trash.

114
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,910
而且这节目完全
And that show has absolutely

115
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,650
和咱们的宝贝服务挂不上钩
nothing to do with our Babysitting Service.

116
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,050
是啊  这些布偶住在水里面
Yeah. Those puppets live underwater.

117
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,480
咱们可都在水上面看孩子呢
And we always babysit above water.

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
你觉得我们
Do you think we really have

119
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,820
真的有必要去把名称改掉吗
to change the name of our Babysitting Service?

120
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,230
不  要是我就不担心这张愚蠢的通告
No. I wouldn't worry about these dumb papers.

121
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,620
律师总是整这些繁文缛节
Lawyers are full of mumbo and jumbo.

122
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,980
你确定
You sure?

123
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,780
不确定
No.

124
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,300
噢  我得赶去机场了
Oh, I have to get to the airport.

125
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,800
-你要去哪里  -墨西哥
- Oh, where ya going? - Mexico!

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,510
去墨西哥做啊
Mexico? Why?

127
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,770
这个嘛  就是有着
Well, let's just say it involves bikinis,

128
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,410
比基尼  指绘和辣椒的地方啦
finger painting, and hot peppers.

129
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,350
瓜达拉哈拉
Guadalajara.

130
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,620
她在那充满比基尼  指绘和辣椒
What could she be doing that involves bikinis,

131
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,080
的地方能做什么
finger painting, and hot peppers?

132
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,290
噢我的天啊
Oh my God!

133
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,590
她说什么
What'd she say?

134
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,030
没说什么  她向我耳朵里伸舌头
Nothing. She stuck her tongue in my ear.

135
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,840
可我以为马是用来骑的
But I thought horses were only meant for riding.

136
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,050
通常是这样  可我妈当时非常饿  然后就..
Yeah, usually, but when my Mom gets super hungry, it's...

137
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,910
真恶心
Ewe.

138
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,110
嘿 门这是怎么了
Hey, what's up with the Po-Po?

139
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,960
嘿
Hey!

140
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,490
这是怎么回事
What's the situation?

我喜欢看杂技

150
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,490
那么  这个黄封条和大锁是怎么回事
So, what's with the yellow tape and the big lock?

Well, I'm sorry, but some

拿着法官的书面通知要封掉你的公寓

158
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,070
用莎姆和小猫这个名称

167
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
如果我还是闯进去了呢
What if I just break in anyway?

168
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,880
那我就只能用我的泰瑟枪..

No. I mean, why did you call and ask to meet with me?

205
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,840
噢对了  是这样的  我的好盆友和我经营一个
Oh, right. See, my friend and I have this business called

Sam and Cat's super rockin' fun-time Babysitting Service.

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,830

-就是啊  -是吧
- I know! - Yeah!

209
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,830
但是有个法官不让我们进我们的公寓了
Except a Judge locked us out of our apartment.

210
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,630
哦
Oh.

211
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,590
因为我们生意的名字
Because our business name

212
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,530
太像你过去的节目  鲑鱼猫
sounds too much like your old TV show, Salmon Cat.

213
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,120
你知道我收集运动球吗
Do you know I collect sports balls?

214
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,220
说啥
Say what?

215
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,350
看  这些墙上
See, these walls are filled

216
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,120
挂满了世界上存在的每一种
with sports balls from every sport in the world.

217
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,340
在运动里使用的球
That uses a ball.

218
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,370
嗯
Hmm.

219
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,740
而且每个球上都有运动明星签的名
And every ball is autographed by a famous sports ball player.

220
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,230
哇哦  我们能谈谈别的吗
Wow, can we talk about something else?

221
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,630
你随便说个运动  我都有那个球
I'll bet I have a ball for any sport you can name.

222
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,310
我不想说来着
I don't wanna name a sport.

223
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,380
-说一个  -网球
- Name a sport. - Tennis.

224

就在这儿
Right here.

227
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,820
曲棍球
Hockey?

228
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,360
曲棍球用的是饼状的冰球  不算运动球
Hockey is played with a puck, not a sports ball.

229
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,460
抱歉啦
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,650
问我垒球吧
Now, ask me about softballs.

231
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,960
嗯
Um...

232
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,440
-你有垒球吗  -九个
- Do you have any softballs? - Nine.

233
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,670
-再多一个就十个了  -哦

234
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,160
-来个饼干球  -好的  
- Cookie ball? - All right.

235
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,050
哦
Ooh.

236
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,150
好吃
Mm.

237
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,390
嗯
Mm.

238
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,470
然后我就把那条内裤套到那个警察的脑袋上了
So then, I put the underwear right on top of the cop's head.

239
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,940
-你这孩子真有意思  -我还行吧
- You're a funny kid. - Ah, I'm all right.

240
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
说回这件鲑鱼猫的事
So, anyway, back to this whole Salmon Cat thing.

241
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,210
哦  什么
Oh, yeah what?

242
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,060
那个律师真的是在难为我和我朋友
That lawyer is really giving me and my friend a hard time.

243
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,030
抱歉  是我邻居的狗
Excuse me. My neighbor's dog.

244
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,970
真好听啊  是吧
Pleasant, isn't it?

245
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,950
如果你们不让那只狗闭嘴
If you don't shut that barking dog up,

246
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,980
我就亲自过去把你的脸撕碎
I'm gonna come up and rip your face off.

247
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,430
喝点苏打水吗
Would you like a soda?

248
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,010
不  谢了
No, thank you.

249
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,010
我在想  你能不能
So I was thinking, if you could just,

250
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,470
额  签张合同什么的
like, sign a piece of paper.

251
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,020
一点儿闲着的时候都没有
All day long.

252
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,410
好吧  如果你们不让它闭嘴
Okay. If you don't shut that dog up,

253
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,250
我就过去
I'm gonna come up with a garden hose...

254
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,930
把浇花的水管缠到你妈的肥脖子上
And wrap it around your Mother's fat neck!

255
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,820
来点奶酪和饼怎么样
How about some cheese and crackers?

256
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,560
这是个棒球
Now, this is a baseball.

257
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,500
是啊
Uh-huh.

258
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,280
你看  是棒球明星泰・柯布签名的
You see, it's signed by the famous baseball player, Ty Cobb.

259
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,640
哦哇哦  我喜欢他的玉米
Oh wow, I love his corn.

260
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,850
那个  关于你原来的节目  鲑鱼猫
Look, about your old TV puppet show, Salmon Cat.

261
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,120
我不想谈鲑鱼猫  它已经是我的过去了
I don't want to talk about Salmon Cat. Salmon Cat is in my past.

262
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,170
我现在的生活主题是运动球
My life now is about sports balls.

263
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,230
但我只需要
But I just need you to...

264
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,590
而且  我不是一个人做出的鲑鱼猫
And besides, I didn't create Salmon Cat by myself, you know.

265
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,670
我知道  你和另一位女士合作  
I know. You created it with another lady...

266
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,620
啊啊啊  别说了
Ah, ah, ah. Don't.

267
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,200
别说她的名字  别在我的球面前说
Don't speak her name, not in front of my sports balls.

268
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,470
现在我的室友就在
See, right now, my roommate

269
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,580
和你的老搭档珍妮丝・多布谈话
is talking to your old partner, Janice Dobb...

270
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,380
别说她的名字
Don't say her name.

271
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,010
你没必要大声说出来
You don't have to say it out loud.

272
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,520
-怎么  你不喜欢她  -我恨她
- Why, you don't like her? - I hate her!

273
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,050
我已经30年没和她说过话了
You know I haven't spoken to her in 30 years?

274
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,820
我们只需要你们俩在一块儿
So, all we need you guys to do is get together for, like,

275
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,790
5分钟  同意我们使用我们这个名字就行
five minutes and agree to let us use our names.

276
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,110
我很愿意帮你们  真的  但是
Look, I'd like to help you out, I really would, but...

277
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,780
我的人生啊
That's my life.

278
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,870
那只狗再叫一声  我就上去
If that dog barks one more time today, I'm gonna go up...

279
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,740
噎到饼干了
Cracker stuck in throat!

280
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,950
噎到饼干了
Cracker stuck in throat.

281
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,770
我来吧
Let me...

282
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,290
非常好
Very good.

283
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,290
都让他鸣咽了
You made it whimper.

284
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,900
那你为什么这么讨厌西尔维娅
So, why do you hate Sylvia so much?

285
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,140
因为我们的木偶节目鲑鱼猫  得了一个木偶奖
Because our puppet show, Salmon Cat, won a Pupper.

286
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,470
哇哦  从来没听过哎
Wow. I don't know what a Pupper is.

287
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,670
木偶奖  
A Pupper is an award...

288
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,330
是为了奖励儿童电视木偶节目领域
For outstanding achievement

289
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,210
杰出节目的
in the field of children's television puppetry.

290
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,550
人们很看中这个奖吗
And people care about that?

291
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,220
当然
Oh, yes.

292
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,320
非常风光的时刻
And it was a great moment.

293
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,780
我们终于赢了芝麻街那群混蛋了
We finally beat out those jerks over at Sesame Street.

294
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,700
后来怎么了
Well, then what happened?

295
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
我告诉你后来怎么了
Oh, I'll tell you what happened.

296
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,800
啊哈
Uh-huh.

297
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,540
她决定要把奖拿回她家
She decides that she wants to take it home to her house.

298
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,620
哦
Ooh.

299
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,480
哦
Ooh.

300
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,200
然后斯尔威亚说  这是你的节目也是我的节目
And then Sylvia says, it was my show as much as it was yours.

301
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,520
所以奖杯要拿到我家
So I'm keeping the statue at my house.

302
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,990
啊  真是个婊子
Ugh, what a bichon.

303
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,920
然后她就夺走了奖杯
And so then she grabs the statue,

304
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,380
然后我又夺了回来  她又夺了过去
and I grab it back, and she grabs it back,

305
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,090
我夺回来  她夺回去  最后把奖杯抢成了两半
I grab it back, she grabs it back and breaks that statue in half.

306
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,350
哦
Oh!

307
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,030
所以你才这么恨西尔维娅
So that's why you hate Sylvia.

308
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,910
我想把这个拳头
I'd like to take this

309
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,940
塞进她脖子最软的那块儿
fist and jam it in the soft part of her neck.

310
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,440
好的  谢谢珍妮丝
Okay, thanks, Janice.

311
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,940
再见  亲爱的
Bye, darling.

312
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,340
所以你才这么狠珍妮丝
And that's why you hate Janice?

313
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,390
是  我想把这个话筒
Yeah, I'd like to take this

314
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,250
塞进她的大鼻孔
microphone and stick it right up her big nose hole.

315
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,120
-好的  谢谢你的奶酪  -随时欢迎你来
- Okay, thanks for the cheese. - You're welcome anytime.

316
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,580
可真吃了不少奶酪
She ate a lot of cheese.

317
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,440
-嗨  所以  -嘿
- Hi. So... - Hey.

318
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,670
你好  问我新出的猪肉饼
Hello, ask me about our new pork puffs!

319
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,470
没兴趣
No.

320
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,170
我那就在这等到你们感兴趣
Then I'll wait here until you're curious.

321
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,840
我们怎么要西尔维娅和珍妮丝来帮我们
So, how do we get Sylvia and Janice to help us?

322
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,740
不知道
I don't know. All they

323
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,580
她们现在就是想把对方打出翔
wanna do is beat the fudge out of each other.

324
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,440
啊
Ugh!

325
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,180
-嘿  -嗨
- Hey! - Hi.

326
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,360
你去找珍妮丝
I want you to go get Janice

327
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,620
带她4点去搏击馆
and bring her to Punchy's gym at four o'clock.

328
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,560
哈
Huh?

329
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,360
告诉她西尔维娅想和她打架
Tell her that Sylvia wants to fight her.

330
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
-打架  -没错
- Fight her? - Mm hm.

331
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,090
我去找西尔维娅
And I'll go get Sylvia

332
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,530
告诉她珍妮丝想和她打架
and tell her that Janice wants to fight her.

333
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,900
我们不能改个名字搬个家吗
Can't we just change our names and move into a new apartment?

334
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,830
-找珍妮丝  带她到搏击馆  -啊
- Go get Janice and take her to Punchy's. - Ah!

335
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,580
你卖出猪肉饼了吗
Did you sell them any pork puffs?

336
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,380
没
No.

337
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,450
很好  现在你知道被拒绝是什么滋味了
Good. Now you know how it feels to be rejected.

338
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,530
我从来没爱过你
I never loved you.

339
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,860
我有点紧张
Oh, I'm pretty nervous about this.

340
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,730
相信我没错
Just trust me.

341
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,670
上周我就相信了你  给了你奶奶的信用卡
Last week I trusted you with my Nona's credit card,

342
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,910
我一不注意  你就买了10磅的蟹腿
and when I wasn't looking, you bought ten pounds of crab legs.

343
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,820
得了吧  如果有人切了你的腿
Come on. If someone cut off your legs,

344
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,540
然后放在沸水里煮
then cooked them in boiling water,

345
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,020
你不希望他们
wouldn't you want somebody

346
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,410
吃的时候蘸点儿黄油吗
to enjoy them with a little melted butter?

347
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,580
珍妮丝和西尔维娅这个年纪根本不能打架
Janice and Sylvia are too old to be fighting.

348
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,450
她们不会真的打架的
They're not really gonna fight.

349
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,040
但我们告诉
But we told them they...

350
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,560
那只是要她们来这儿的借口罢了
That was just to get them to come here.

351
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,420
哈
Huh?

352
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,030
你看着吧
You watch.

353
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,770
她们一看见对方
As soon as they see each other,

354
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,630
就会记起她们过去是多好的朋友
they're gonna remember how they used to be friends.

355
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,210
哦  好吧
Oh, all right.

356
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,970
那个碧池在哪
Where is that bichon?

357
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,340
开打  开打吧
Let's do this thing. Let's do this thing.

358
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,570
好嘞  你想干点什么吗
Okay. You wanna do something?

359
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,730
开始吧  来吧
Let's do it. Come on, let's do it.

360
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,280
我听说你闺女再婚了
I hear your daughter got re-married.

361
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,880
嗯  嫁给了足部医生
Yeah. To a foot doctor.

362
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,490
手足病医生  不错嘛
A chiropodist. Nice.

363
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,490
记得我那个脚趾总是感染吗
Remember that infected toe I had forever?

364
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,030
-臭的那个  -臭的那个  他给治好了
- Ooh. Stinky toe. - Stinky toe. He cured it.

365
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,360
-臭脚趾再见了  -那真不错啊
- No more stinky toe. - That's so nice.

366
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,170
她们很友好啊
Oh, they're being friendly.

367
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,230
嘘  闭嘴下
Shh. Try to shut up.

368
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,740
哦
Oh!

369
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,410
哦
Oh!

370
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,950
疼疼疼疼
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

371
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,330
哦
Oi.

372
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,870
起开
Get off me!

373
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,870
起来
Get up!

374
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,800
别人打架是不都开始得比这个快多了
Don't most fights happen faster than this?

375
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
是啊
Yeah.

376
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,170
这个真是慢
This one's really slow.

377
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,870
啊
Ah!

378
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,070
我好像听到腿断了
I think I just heard her leg break.

379
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,060
不  她的胯而已
Nah. That was her hip.

380
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,470
哈哈
Ha ha!

381
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,730

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,390
-哦哦  -你觉得什么时候会结束
- Oh! Oh! - When do you think this'll be over?

383
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,410
不知道  她们这么老了
I don't know. They're pretty old.

384
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,700
我们该干点什么吗
Should we do something?

385
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,760
我可以叫个比萨
I can order a pizza.

386
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,970
我不应该相信你
I shouldn't have trusted you.

387
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,330
对  你犯错了
Yeah, you made a mistake.

388
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,840

Oh, and wait, we got you a little

398
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,180
我们想送你们点小礼物
something to thank you for being so nice to us.

399
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,260
-哦  -好贴心
- Aw. - Sweet.

400
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,710
小猫在网上某个拍卖网站发现了这个
Uh, Cat went online to some auction site and she found...

401
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,050
1974年的玩具

I haven't seen one of them in 30 years.

405
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,030
我好多年都没碰过了
I haven't held a Salmon Cat in years.

406
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,370
我要把你带回家  放在我家
I am going to take you home and I am going to put you up on my...

407

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,400
谁说你可以带回家了
Who says you get to take her home?

409
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,830
我才要带她回家
I do get to take her home.

410
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,650
你的都是运动球  和这个不搭
You got sports balls. It doesn't match.

411
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,150
不  我要把她带回家  给我
No. I'm gonna take her home. Give her to me.
