你应该去问警察

5
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:10,973
欧洲隧道里发生了什么
what is happening in the Eurotunnel.

00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:18,925
现在是英法联合调查 我们别无选择

9
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:20,678
他不靠谱

10

11
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,596
他们想杀了我

12
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:25,077
谁想杀了你

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,570
等等 你们不能把我留在这儿

求求你 回来
You can't! Please, come back.

15
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:30,756

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,959
我们会离真相越来越近的
We shall all be getting closer to the truth.

17

18
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,280

我不收小额的"款项"
I don't take tiny instalments.

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,534
你兄弟怎么样
How's your brother?

21

你告诉他我们要结婚了吗
You told him we're getting married yet?

22
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,000
你别管我兄弟
You leave my brother alone.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,432
他如果再花这么多时间
Tell him if he keeps spending so much time

24
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:19,785
在我的人身边转...

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,523
就要付出代价了
he's gonna have to start paying.

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,840
知道了 图帕克
Get you, Tupac.

27

这是南肯特 亲爱的 不是南洛杉矶
This is South Kent, my darling, not South LA.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,400
其他人敢这样跟我说话 我会灭了他们
Anybody else spoke to me like that, I'd smash them up.

根本没有炸弹

去年七月 我在布拉格
July last year I was in Prague.

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,400
我不需要花钱找女人 就算如此
Besides, if I did pay for gash, which I don't have to,

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,750
我想我绝对不会看上
I think I'd aim a little bit higher

49

英国海港街道上的
than some crack-addled tart

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,720
那些残花败柳
off the streets of an English seaport.

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,520
怎么会有别人用你的车呢 还两次
How would anyone have access to your car? Twice?

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,940
我没有史酷比啊 亲爱的

我们可以到外面谈谈吗
Can we have a word outside?

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,480
你一定很高兴有个法国人帮忙

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,080
她就像马其诺防线一样有用
She's about as useful as the Maginot Line, that one.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,080
{\an8}一战后为防德军入侵构筑的防线

我要回法国了
I'm going back to France.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,864
如果我不在那儿
Maybe he will calm down and stop showing off

61
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:39,840
他或许会冷静下来 不再炫耀
if I am not there.

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
好吧
All right.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,881
我们会监听他的手机
We'll tap his phone

64
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,351
并远程监控他的电脑 以防...

65
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,582
总探长在哪里 凶手上传了一个视频
Where's the DCI? The killer's put a video up.

66

已经有几千点击率了

68
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:09,596
我们确定服务器的位置了吗

69
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
正在查找

70
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,340
我在欧洲隧道留了两具尸体

71
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:23,290
一个大名鼎鼎的法国政客

72
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:28,292
和一个默默无闻的英国妓女

73
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,800
我把她们放在一起是要说明一个简单的道理
I brought them together to show a simple truth...

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,154
法律面前人人并不平等
There is no equality before the law.

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,640
这是我的第一条真理

还有四条即将揭晓
There are four still to come.

77
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,920
我肯定警察会竭尽全力地抓到我

78
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:55,997
这是他们在犯罪现场认真工作的画面

79
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:01,500
去隧道 找到这些摄像头

80
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,640
那里没有监控摄像头
There's no CCTV there.

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
他绝对有针孔相机
He must have hidden cameras.

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
- 头儿 - 什么
- Boss! - What?

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,776
他在这里
It's here.

你什么意思
What do you mean, it's here?

85
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:17,036
他入侵了英国警局 正在使用他们的服务器

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
关掉它 马上
Shut it down! Now!

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,120
弄清楚他是怎么做到的
Find out how he is doing it.

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,311
天哪
Christ!

89
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,840
给你们最后一个影像
One last image for you...

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,040
看 她像欧元区一样分崩离析了
Look, she comes apart like the Eurozone.

91
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,480
你注意到他的话了吗 "我留下第一条真理"
You notice what he said. "I left. My first truth."

92
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
圣经体
Biblical.

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,580
像某些旧约中的上帝
Like some Old Testament God.

94
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,560
带着四个即将揭晓的真相

96
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,050
# 到我的怀抱里 #

# 抛开一切恐惧 #
Set aside all fear

100
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,740
# 红线一根 缠绕永远 #

101
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:20,774
# 是的 你是我的 #

102
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,473
# 直到时间的尽头 #

"Assuredly it was one of Constance's bad days,

105
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,640
在那些日子里 她察觉到
one of those days on which she felt that the tide of life

106
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,600
生命的潮汐已毫无顾忌地将她搁浅
had left her stranded in utter neglect.

107
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,024
唯有伯斯利镇
The sound of the Bursley Town

108
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:44,640
银奖乐队的歌声
Silver Prize Band aroused her

109
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
- 能把她从苦痛中唤醒" - 我要吃药
- from her suffering..." - I need my medicine now.

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,320
还没到时间
It's not really time.

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080

谢谢
Thank you.

114
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:41,132
死者是玛丽・维伦纽夫吗

115
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,441
凶手是法国人还是英国人

116
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,203
什么时候开新闻发布会

117
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,556
那五条真理还有什么隐情吗

118
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,041
今晚有空吗 队长

119
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:54,718
服务器关闭了 但视频已在网上蹿红

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,517
司法部大发雷霆

121
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,396
不像是有组织犯罪

122
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:01,562
这安抚不了他们 我们得抓住罪犯

123
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,110
我知道

124
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,843
跟我们英国同仁怎么样

125
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:10,717
他话太多

126
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,435
好的 除此之外呢

127
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,196
他的车闻起来像条湿狗

128
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:24,200
三个摄像头 被安在了隧道管线里

129
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,436
- 调查员呢 - 没问题 在回来的路上

在网上看到你了 爸爸
Saw you on the web, Dad.

141
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,880
尸体分成两半的时候真酷
It's pretty awesome when the bodies just come apart.

142
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,200
是啊 他们说网络使人变得麻木
Yeah... and they say the internet de-sensitises people.

143
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,240
和你讲话的可人是谁
So who's the babe you're chatting with?

144
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,720
查克斯 他来过新年派对 记得吗
Chuks. Remember he came to the New Year's Party?

145
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
一个法国同事
A French colleague.

146
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
她叫什么
What's her name?

147
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
羊角面包
Fifi Croissant.

148
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
{\an8}法国传统早餐

149
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,720
我也会选这个
Yeah? Well, I would.

150
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,560
你想太多了
There's a fairly large assumption behind that statement.

151
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,105
今晚想几点睡觉
What time would you like turndown this evening?

152
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:32,905
什么
What?

153
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,997
喜欢什么样的枕边巧克力
What sort of chocolate would you like on your pillow?

154
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,645
真好笑
Yeah, funny.

155
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:41,484
在维伦纽夫尸体伤口周围

156
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:44,077
我们发现了少量吉玛的血迹

157
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,196
吉玛身上却没有

158
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,171
他先把吉玛分尸 然后才是维伦纽夫

159
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:50,238
是的

160
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,476
同一时间 同一把锯

161
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:54,648
什么样的锯

162
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,517
屠宰牲畜的手锯

163
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,876
他在屠宰场干的

164
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:04,394
一手抬一具尸体很难办到

165
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,920
屠宰场可不是容易进去的地方

166
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,483
欧洲隧道也是

167
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,085
没错

168
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,517
照顾好自己 爱丽丝

169
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:21,159
吃点东西 注意休息 身体需要这些 

170
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,102
我知道了

171
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,520
你睡得很沉
You sleep very deeply.

172
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,160
你来这做什么
What are you doing here?

173
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,960
工作
Working.

174
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,600
你不能 就这么走进来
You can't just... walk in here.

175
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,320
这栋公寓是我给你弄到的 记得吗
I got you this flat, remember?

176
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,280
是啊 通过勒索出租屋管理员
Yeah, by blackmailing the lettings officer.

177
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
他不该拿公寓做性交易
He shouldn't trade council flats for sex.

178
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,640
你想怎么样
What do you want?

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
确保你没事
To make sure you're okay.

180
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
- 你有钱吗 - 有
- Do you have money? - Mm-hmm.

181
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,640
我找了份兼职
I've even got a part-time job.

182
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,920
如果那男人...
If that man...

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,080
拜托
Oh, please.

184
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,880
你还记得在特雷斯科岛度假的日子吗
Do you remember those holidays on Tresco?

185
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
他带我去钓鲭鱼
He took me spinning for mackerel.

186
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,223
它们从海中飞越而出
The colour of them in the air, green and silver,

187
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,837
在空中闪着银绿色的光
the sea flying off them.

188
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,180
它们翻腾起伏着
They were thrashing around...

189
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
头敲击着船底
their heads smacking against the bottom of the boat.

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
眼睛撞出了血
Bloody eyes.

191
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,252
我在船的一侧吐了
I was sick over the side of the boat.

192
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,760
他笑了
He laughed.

193
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
告诉我
Tell me.

194
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
我已经告诉你了
I've already told you.

195
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,240
跟我说说他眼中的神情
Tell me about the expression in his eyes.

196
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,320
我得走了
I have to go.

197
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
我会给你找个工作
I'll find a job for you.

198
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,080
你来这做什么
What are you doing here?

199
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,880
离我的宿舍远点 离我姐妹远点
Stay away from my hostel... and stay away from my sister.

200
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,400
你的宿舍 你的姐妹
Oh, your hostel. Your sister.

201
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
听好了 慈善家先生
Check out Mr. Charity

202
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,620
你为什么不滚到非洲
Why don't you fuck off to Africa

203
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,680
给狮子普及艾滋病知识
and teach HIV awareness to the lions?

204
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,080
你以为能吓到我吗
Do you think you frighten me?

205
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,946
我是你能随便扇耳光的
Do you think I am one of the girls

206
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:08,840
那些姑娘吗
you can just slap about?

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
没错
Yeah.

208
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,240
你犯了个错误
That was a mistake.

209
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,680
我喜欢你的姐妹
You know, I like your sister.

210
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,317
她有独创性 有灵魂
She's original, she's got spirit...

211
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,920
而且她床上功夫不错
and she wriggles in bed.

212
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,013
正因为她在
And it's only because of her

213
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,981
你在码头才没被打倒
that you're not face-down in the harbour.

214
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,504
为什么这么敌对
So why all the hostility?

215
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,040
因为你得不到她吧
Is it 'cos you can't have her?

216
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,559
这就是我见到维伦纽夫女士的地方

217
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,396
会议过后她去公园走了走 清醒头脑

218
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:37,316
我们彻底搜过那个公园 没有证据和目击证人

219
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:40,036
你为什么会在马赛

220
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:41,396
我母亲病了

221
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:44,525
谢谢

222
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:49,956
女士 您还是什么都不要吗

223
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:51,923
不了 谢谢

224
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:54,476
玛丽・维伦纽夫收到过威胁吗

225
00:17:58,516 --> 00:17:59,676
疯子的档案

226
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,076
什么样的疯子

227
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,756
极左极右的阴谋论者

228
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,524
"接种疫苗是犹太复国主义者政府的武器"

229
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,477
从他们对接种疫苗的态度能看出来谁是傻子

230
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,277
知道是谁炸了双子大楼吗

231
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:18,515
摩萨德 外星人 齐丹 齐达内 全在这里

232
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:22,435
我想可能是极右派 她想从他们那里获取选票

233
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:23,606
种族主义者的选票

234
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:25,957
我并不想这么称呼

235
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,282
- 为什么 - 因为这要比之复杂得多

236
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:31,916
通常人们越想逃避真相 事情就会变得越复杂

237
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,240
这个座位有人了
That seat's taken.

238
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
挺有洞察力啊
Very observant.

239
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
是你的吧
One of yours?

240
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,440
我的什么
One of my what?

241
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,525
我想在这地方
I'm guessing it easier

242
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:33,200
搞到一点可卡因应该比
to get a gram of stepped-on cocaine

243
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,600
搞到三明治要容易得多吧
in this place than a sandwich,

244
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,543
可是快午餐时间了
but it's nearly lunchtime,

245
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:38,200
我很饿 老二又疼
I'm very hungry and my balls are aching.

246
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,480
这是谁
Try again.

247
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,240
- 吉玛 - 不错
- Gemma. - Good.

248
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,120
吉玛・柯万
Gemma Kirwan.

249
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,400
- 不错 还有呢 - 还有什么
- Good. And? - And what?

250
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,940
她死了 你还有什么要跟我说的吗
And she's dead, so what else can you tell me?

251
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
跟 坦妮娅谈吧
Talk to Tania.

252
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,400
通常在多弗路能找到她
You'll usually find her up on the Dover Road.

253
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,729
她们经常吵架
They were spars.

254
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,364
我只知道这些
That really is all I can tell you.

255
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,560
我要找坦妮娅
I'm looking for Tania.

256
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,160
是坦妮娅吗
Tania?

257
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,560
我至今还没有坐过警车的
I haven't had a close encounter with the passenger seat

258
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
副驾驶呢 长官
of your Mondeo yet, officer.

259
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,480
坦妮娅 我可比别人要略胜一筹哦
I am a cut above the rest, Tania.

260
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,213
我们能谈谈吗 关于吉玛
Can we have a chat? About Gemma.

261
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,440
能去我的住所吗
Can we go to my place?

262
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
这是谁
Who is this?

263
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,408
我儿子 毛瑞西欧
It's my son... Mauricio.

264
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,240
你从没跟我提起过他
You didn't mention him.

265
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,440
这个重要吗
Does it make a difference?

266
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,760
刚才外面的那个男人 别再和他说话了
The man you were with outside, you must not talk to him.

267
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,600
他说会帮我找份工作
He said he would help me to find a job.

268
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,280
他是个粗暴的皮条客
He's a violent pimp.

269
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
他可能还会伤害到你的儿子的
He might hurt your son as well.

270
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,480
打包好你的东西
Pack your things.

271
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,672
你要把我们赶出去吗
Are you are throwing us out?

272
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:29,600
你只管收拾好就是
Pack your things.

273
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
那个是你男朋友吗
Is that your boyfriend?

274
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,600
斯蒂芬吗 他都没有吻过女孩子吧
Stephen? I don't think he's even kissed a girl.

275
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,960
他是上流人士 和你一样谈吐有礼
He's posh, talks nice, just like you.

276
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,940
我不是上流人士 我是有教养 差别大了去了
I'm not posh, I'm educated. Big difference.

277
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,280
我只觉得她母亲很可怜
It's the mum I feel sorry for.

278
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,160
她不停地去警局
She kept going to the Old Bill

279
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,715
说她女儿有危险
and saying how her daughter must be in danger,

280
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:12,560
你们却不采取保护措施
and you did nothing.

281
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,120
每周日同一时间 吉玛都会给她母亲打电话
Every Sunday, Gem would call her mum at the same time.

282
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,920
你们应该去查查通话记录
You could have checked the phone records,

283
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
就会知道出了问题
seen there must be something wrong.

284
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,440
她失踪之前情绪怎么样
What was her mood like before she disappeared?

285
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,000
挺好的 情绪高涨
Yeah, good. She was up.

286
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,940
她说她恋爱了
She said she'd fallen in love.

287
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,320
- 跟谁 - 她没说
- Who with? - Wouldn't say.

288
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,931
只说他头脑聪明
Only that he had a brain-shaped head

289
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,500
他们一起聊天
and they'd talk about stuff.

290
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,680
聊了什么
What sort of stuff?

291
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,440
你知道的 不公正之类的
You know, injustice and that.

292
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
政治上的东西
Political shit.

293
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,040
我们只当她开玩笑
We took the piss a bit.

294
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,068
说他根本就不存在
We said he didn't really exist,

295
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:01,800
但是她好像很认真
but she just got all serious

296
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,440
还说她不会告诉我们的
and said she couldn't tell us.

297
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,260
结果有天她就不见了
Then one day she was just gone.

298
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
你们报案了吗
Did you tell the police?

299
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
这是在她房间里找到的
It was in her room.

300
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,928
我们翻看过
We checked to see

301
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:32,160
想找到她有关去向的线索
if there was any clues about where she'd gone.

302
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
有没有提到...
Does it mention...?

303
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,240
正好写到那里就没有了
It stops at exactly that point.

304
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,597
他真的上传了一个尸体视频吗
Is it true he's put a video up and it shows the body?

305
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,465
是的
Yeah.

306
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
他还说这是想让大家知道没人会在乎
And he says this is all to show how nobody values

307
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,060
一个妓女的生命吗
the life of a prostitute?

308
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,200
是的
Yep.

309
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
我们一定赢不了 是吗
We really can't win, can we?

310
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,397
我看过一遍疯子的档案了

311
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:18,479
所有人的

312
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,996
包括极端的无政府主义宗教狂热分子

313
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:24,237
精神错乱的人

314
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:28,117
甚至还有个农场主只吃他自己种出来的东西

315
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:32,681
我已经按优先顺序排好放在USB里了

316
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:34,723
不相关的我就略过了

317
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:36,357
我要完整的

318
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,359
- 不用谢 - 你说什么

319
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:43,156
我说不用谢

320
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,396
难道你每次给我文件我都要说谢谢吗

321
00:24:47,557 --> 00:24:49,556
不 一次就足够了

322
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:52,446
谢谢

323
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:54,511
真不错

324
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:58,237
不用担心下次 这次的还作数

325
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:01,196
好的

326
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:13,196
英国快递

327
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,266
你人真好
You're really kind.

328
00:25:56,866 --> 00:26:00,066
你想听音乐吗 或者广播
Do you want some music on? The radio?

329
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:01,346
我也可以再给你读书
I could read to you again?

330
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,186
放张CD吧
Put a CD on.

331
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:30,674
# 我曾住在摩尔街 #
In Moore Street where I did dwell 

332
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:35,886
我的亚瑟过去常唱这首歌 他的声音优美低沉
My Arthur used to sing this... Lovely deep voice he had.

333
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,626
# 我深爱着 #
I loved right well 

334
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:45,706
# 他追求我 一生逝去 #
He courted me my life away 

335
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,706
# 但如今和我一起 #
But now with me... 

336
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:54,066
多傻的女孩啊 苏
Such foolish girls, eh, Suze?

337
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:57,146
满世界都是
World's full of them.

338
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:02,146
你的孩子怎么不多来看看你
Why don't your children come and visit you more?

339
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:04,866
他们有自己的生活...
They have their own lives...

340
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,266
自己的孩子...
Their children...

341
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:09,406
科林住在悉尼
Colin lives in Sydney,

342
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,906
我当然不能怪他
of course, so I can hardly blame him.

343
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:13,866
这不公平
It's not fair.

344
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:18,586
我很高兴有你陪我
Well, I'm glad I have you.

345
00:27:20,186 --> 00:27:23,706
# 在常青藤上 #
...on an ivy tree... 

346
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:47,946
我明天给你带食物来
I'll bring you food tomorrow.

347
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:52,266
我不喜欢这儿
I don't like it here.

348
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:01,386
你没有别的选择
You don't have an alternative.

349
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:05,226
那个男人让你处境危险
You're in danger from that man.

350
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:11,746
房子附近有匹马
There's a horse in the field around the house.

351
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:21,666
你喜欢马吗
Do you like horses?

352
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:45,066
谁都不能知道你在这儿
No one can know you're here.

353
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,520
孩子可以去花园玩
The boy is all right in the garden,

354
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,346
不然就别离开房子
otherwise don't leave the house.

355
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,559
当地农民并不同情
Local farmers are not exactly sympathetic

356
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,426
寻求庇护失败者
to failed asylum seekers.

357
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:33,511
晚上好

358
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,880
你还在上班啊

359
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:40,876
想喝点什么

360
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:44,236
你喜欢男人还是女人

361
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,915
- 通常是女人 - 你有女朋友吗

362
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,162
你有老公吗

363
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:57,112
没有

364
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:59,037
给我看看你的手

365
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:07,322
这证明不了什么 我可以把戒指摘掉

366
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:10,238
那你为什么那么做呢

367
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:15,516
因为我想和你上床

368
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:29,613
现在吗

369
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,626
我昨天去见丹尼・希勒了
I met Danny Hillier yesterday.

370
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:45,426
- 丹尼・希勒是谁 - 那个小报记者
- Who's Danny Hillier? - The tabloid journalist.

371
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:48,026
他写普通人的事儿 相当于他的一个标签
He writes about ordinary folk, sort of his catchphrase.

372
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:52,466
说明他讨厌移民
Ordinary for him means hating immigrants,

373
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,866
他们多用俚语 不学无术
talking in rhyming slang and not reading books.

374
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:59,026
- 听起来像统治者的工具 - 是
- Sounds like a tool of the highest order. - Yes, he is.

375
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:02,226
- 他应该见见爷爷 - 没错
- He should meet granddad. - Yes.

376
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:04,546
对那个老王八蛋来说没什么是正常的
Nothing ordinary about that old bastard, eh?

377
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:08,226
我不知道
I dunno.

378
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:10,266
你不知道什么
What don't you know?

379
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,766
他没扔下奶奶
Well, he didn't just leave grandma on her own

380
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,186
让她一个人带孩子
to bring up the kids,

381
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:15,586
所以至少他还是有正常的地方的
so there was something ordinary about him at least.

382
00:31:21,186 --> 00:31:22,986
但他有点脾气
He had a bit of a temper on him though.

383
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,266
我话多的时候他会给我反手一下
Gave me a couple of backhanders when I got too mouthy.

384
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,227
- 是吗 - 是的 不过现在不流行了
- Yeah? - Yeah. It's gone out of fashion now.

385
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:29,065
卡尔
Karl!

386
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,826
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

387
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,746
你得洗碗
You're washing up.

388
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:42,186
好的 没必要像警察一样粗暴
All right, no need for police brutality.

389
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:46,688
意面很好吃 劳拉 谢谢
It was delicious pasta, Laura, thanks.

390
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,066
很高兴你喜欢它
I'm glad you liked it.

391
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:55,266
你跟他交谈方法要适当
You are going to have to talk to him properly.

392
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,546
让他洗更多的碗是没用的
Nothing will be solved by making him wash up more.

393
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:49,526
就这样吗

394
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,036
我得睡觉

395
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:54,763
你可以睡这啊 房间是空的

396
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:56,796
我现在要走 不过待会儿会回来

397
00:32:56,956 --> 00:32:58,798
旁边有人我睡不着

398
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:01,476
但你却可以和一个人陌生人上床

399
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:04,676
你不是陌生人啊 我们之前见过

400
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
把你的戒指戴上吧

401
00:33:08,157 --> 00:33:09,395
我没戒指

402
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:13,036
我只是不能接受旁边睡着个人

403
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:14,241
为什么不能

404
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,996
呼吸声太重 会吵到我

405
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:26,677
有人说过你很古怪吗

406
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:28,957
有 人们常常这么想

407
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,115
谢谢 很舒服

408
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:38,282
随时欢迎

409
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:39,445
真的

410
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,088
当然

411
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:44,604
好的

412
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:05,706
怎么了
What is it?

413
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:37,066
该死
Bloody hell.

414
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:42,306
卡尔 告诉奥贝里克斯我想杀了她
Karl, tell Obelix that I'll bloody kill her.

415
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:42,306

你觉得在一个自产自销的有机农场
What would you expect to find

418
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:51,946
能找到什么
on a self-sufficient organic farm?

419
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:58,746
什么 便鞋吧 现在都几点了
What? Birkenstocks. What time is it?

420
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,106
有人生产并屠宰自家的猪
Somebody who produces and butchers their own meat

421
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:02,188
因为他们憎恶
because they hate

422
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:04,026
犹太复国主义的法国政府
the Zionist Occupied Government of France.

423
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:08,506
- 直说吧 - 我觉得我找到了一个屠宰场
- Just tell me. - I think I have found a slaughterhouse.

424
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,666
我要去一探究竟
I'm going to check it out.

425
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:10,416
有可能就在
It might be on the farm of a man

426
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,426
威胁玛丽・维伦纽夫那人的农场里
who threatened Marie Villeneuve.

427
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,586
他叫乔尔・摩金
His name is Joel Mougin.

428
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,466
等等...听着...那个...
Wait... Look... Just...

429
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:18,306
我不会有事的 我只是想确认是否有这么个人
I'll be fine. I just want to see if it has one.

430
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,956
别动 否则我打爆你的头

431
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,596
我是刑侦大队的瓦塞尔曼队长 我有证件

432
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:35,236
证件没用

433
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,158
你想知道里面有什么

434
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:44,319
走啊 进去看

435
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:46,156
别拘束

436
00:37:59,284 --> 00:38:00,284
谁让你来的

437
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:05,719

名字是

439
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:13,156
- 你有犹太血脉? - 我不懂那代表什么

440
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:16,445
我父亲家是犹太人 我母亲是天主教徒

441
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:18,442
对我来说这不重要

442
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:21,403
继续走

443
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:33,053
他们知道

444
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,198
知道来这儿就会死

445
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:39,638
他们恐慌了

446
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,796
闻到了死亡的味道

447
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:46,817
继续走

448
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:51,183
继续走

449
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:24,720
那是什么

450
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,356
别动

451
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:46,197
你的屠宰场怎么有半具尸体

452
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:49,396
我不知道 一周前还没有

453
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,717
你是说是别人干的

454
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:53,996
是的

455
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,880
这些是你发给玛丽・维伦纽夫的吗

456
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:00,836
不瞒你说

457
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,676
我觉得她死不足惜

458
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:06,004
- 摩金先生 - 她不是犹太人

459
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,802
她给犹太复国主义政府做事

460
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:09,559
就是那个给我们的肉下毒的人?

461
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:10,960
是 尽管笑吧

462
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:12,586
我没有笑
I am not laughing.

463
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:13,862
什么

464
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,542
这就是你所认为的法律面前的不平等?
What is your view of inequality before the law?

465
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:19,322
这婊子说什么呢

466
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:28,846
喂
Yup.

467
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:30,743
你好 丹尼
Hello, Danny.

468
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,546
我知道你是谁
I know who this is.

469
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:36,332
警方抓住的那个人
The man the police are holding

470
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,826
只是个白痴纳粹
is only guilty of being a cretinous Nazi.

471
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:42,010
我确定他甚至不知道
I'm sure he doesn't even know

472
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,506
玛丽・维伦纽夫有个小伤疤
Marie Villeneuve had a little scar

473
00:40:44,586 --> 00:40:47,066
在她左胸下
under her left breast,

474
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:49,786
或者吉玛・柯万爱她妈妈
or that Gemma Kirwan loved her mother.

475
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:51,491
你真是个变态 你知道吗
You're a sick fuck, you know that?

476
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:52,760
那辆车的小把戏...
That stunt with the car...

477
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:54,840
我选择乐呢
I have chosen you.

478
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:59,606
我要人们知道我为何如此行事
I want people to know why I am doing this.

479
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:03,756
- 那不是他 - 你甚至还没审问他

480
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:06,959
他不说英语 而且着迷于对犹太人的憎恨

481
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,277
摩金不会让法律的不平等作为他的第一条真理

482
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:13,317
凶手在利用他的屠宰场 要么就是想误导我们

483
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:16,276
凶手又给那个记者打电话了

484
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:18,517
我回去了

485
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:27,146
我选择了你
I have chosen you.

486
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,146
我要人们知道我为何如此行事
I want people to know why I'm doing this.

487
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:37,306
他在尽力教我们
He's trying to teach us.

488
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,876
他想展示暴露我们的道德弱点
He wants to demonstrate his superiority

489
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,066
给他带来的优势
by exposing our moral weakness.

490
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,525
我儿子就有一点儿这个作风
My son's a bit like that.

491
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:46,986
他决定做个素食主义者
He just decided to become a vegetarian.

492
00:41:51,346 --> 00:41:52,960
我姐姐也是
My sister, too.

493
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,626
那张照片 你说对了
You were right about the photograph.

494
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:02,986
曼侬是我的双胞胎姊妹
Manon was my twin.

495
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:06,586
她淹死了
She drowned.

496
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:12,546
你应该会喜欢她的 她很有趣
You would have liked her. She was funny.

497
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:25,106
杀手特意说他选择了你
The killer said specifically that he has chosen you.

498
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:26,346
他为什么这么做
Why would he do that?

499
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:28,746
或者他是我工作的粉丝
Maybe he's a fan of my work.

500
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:31,586
被脑残的追随者包围了是吧
Round up the mindless bigot's then, eh?

501
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,306
看到你带着如此轻蔑的态度
It's nice to see you hold the ordinary working class folk

502
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,046
去从事民间最普通的工作 真好
with such contempt.

503
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:40,506
你可以回答我的问题吗
Can you answer my question?

504
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:41,698
有什么用
What's the point?

505
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:44,146
很明显你已经拿到录音了
You've already got the tapes, obviously.

506
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:46,226
他为什么选中了你
Why did he choose you?

507
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:49,226
老实说 我不知道
Je ne sais fucking pas, honestly.

508
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:53,106
下次试着拖延时间 问他问题
Keep him talking next time, ask him questions.

509
00:42:53,186 --> 00:42:54,586
这是什么 第三帝国?
What is this, the Third Reich?

510
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,866
我是个记者 我不需要接受你们的...
I'm a journalist,I don't need to take orders from...

511
00:42:56,946 --> 00:42:59,446
我们在你车里发现了两克可卡因
We found two grams of cocaine in your car.

512
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:08,146
要问哪种问题
What sort of questions?

513
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:11,146
问他想要什么 他做这个想得到什么
Ask him what he wants. What he hopes to gain by this.

514
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:12,666
问得模糊不清 让他说话
Keep it vague. Keep him talking.

515
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,626
你好
Hello.

516
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:16,506
是的 和他在一块儿
Yeah, with him now.

517
00:43:18,466 --> 00:43:19,786
什么时候
When?

518
00:43:21,146 --> 00:43:22,186
好的
Okay.

519

你介意去查一下你的收件箱吗
Would you mind checking your inbox?

520
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:46,080
{\an8}喝下我

521
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:51,743
老人有什么用 他们不事生产
What good are old people? They do not produce.

522
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,186
他们除了消费我们的税金别无他物...
They consume nothing except our taxes...

523
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,015
所以我们让他们独自死去
so we leave them to die alone.

524
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:10,986
# 他追求我 一生逝去 #
He courted me my life away 

525
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:18,606
# 如今他不再和我一起 #
But now with me he will not stay

526
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:25,786
# 我祈祷 我徒劳地祈祷 #
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain

527
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:33,426
# 希望我能重获青春 #
I wish I were a maid again

528
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:41,106
# 但是光阴一去不复返 #
But a maid again I'll never be... 

529
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:44,066
马尔梅德养老院 人们在死去
Malmead House. People are dying.

530
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:46,146
# 直到樱桃 #
Till cherries grow 

531
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:49,626
# 长在常青藤上 #
On an ivy tree... 

532
00:44:49,706 --> 00:44:50,206
喂
Yeah?

533
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:02,806
是他 开始行动了
It's him. He's started.

534
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:10,226
# 他走上楼 撞开门 #
He went upstairs and the door he broke

535

# 发现她吊在绳子上 #

536

537
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:32,226
# 在她的口袋里 找到了这样的字条 #
And in her pocket these words he found

538
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:38,706
# 把我的坟墓建得宽敞幽深 #
Oh, make my grave large, wide and deep...

539
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:40,586

Stephen.

542
00:45:48,226 --> 00:45:50,586

你给我打了电话 你吃了什么
You called me. What have you taken?

544
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:56,826
# 其间有一个斑鸠 #
And in-between a turtle dove

545
00:45:56,906 --> 00:46:01,906
# 这样全世界都知道 我为爱而死 #
That the world may know I died for love
