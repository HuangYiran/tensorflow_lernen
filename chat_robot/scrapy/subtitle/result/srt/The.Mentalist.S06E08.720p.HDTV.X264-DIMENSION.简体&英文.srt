我们称之为"布莱克组织"

我能理解
Now I understand...

57

你们现在肯定都很害怕
You must all feel scared,

58

很紧张
nervous.

59

不知道接下来会发生什么事  对吗
Don't know what in the hell is gonna happen next, right?

60

Individually.

You are entitled to bring along an attorney or a union rep,

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,550
由你们自己选择
should you so choose.

66
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,360
我们为何需要律师
Why would we need an attorney?

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,280
我们考虑得长远点  金宝
Well, let's look at this from our perspective, Kimball.

68
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,990
你们的上司伯特仑是个罪犯
Your boss Bertram is a criminal.

69
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,670
所以有可能你们也是
Makes sense that you might be one, too.

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,900
我们会非常仔细地审视你们每个人
We will be looking very closely at all of you.

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,230
如果你们有任何
If you have ever done anything

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,590
只要一点点可疑的举动
even remotely questionable,

73
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,870
我们都会发现
We will find out,

74
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,960
然后起诉你们
and we will prosecute.

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,020
当然了  除非
Unless, of course,

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,550
你们能够配合  那我们会非常非常满意
We feel very, very comfortable with your cooperation.

77
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,570
那样你们就有点回旋的余地
Then you got a little wiggle room.

我听说了
I heard.

117
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,150
那你听说了伯特仑当时在加油站做什么吗
Did you hear what Bertram was doing at the gas station?

118
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,100
没
No.

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,140
他在打公用电话
Using a pay phone.

120
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,660
猜猜他打给了谁
Guess who he was calling.

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,470
我猜是简
I'm gonna guess Jane.

122
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,810
没错  那他在哪
Ahh. Yeah. So where is he?

123

我不知道
I don't know.

124

我认为你清楚得很
I think you do.

125

我没法左右你的想法
I can't help what you think.

126
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,400
我认为你的男朋友和一名危险的逃犯勾结
I think your boyfriend is colluding with a dangerous fugitive.

127
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,620
我认为他已经深陷布莱克组织中无法自拔
I think he is up to his neck in this Blake Association craziness,

128
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,120
可能你也是
and probably you are, too.

129
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,630
我不是  他也不是
I'm not. He's not.

130
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,500
简无法阻止打给他的人
Jane can't help who calls him,

131
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,520
而且他也不是我的男朋友
and he's not my boyfriend.

132
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,600
真是太遗憾了  特蕾莎
It's a damn shame, Teresa.

133

By all accounts...

134
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,140
你是个好警察
You were a good cop.

135
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,550

I still am.

Is it safe?

139
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,820
嗯  你们在干嘛
Yeah. What are you doing?

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,130
我们听说了伯特仑今早干的事
We heard about what Bertram did this morning.

141
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,750
听说联调局的人在找我们
We heard the F.B.I. were looking for us.

142
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,470
所以现在是怎样  你们就躲在停车场吗
So what now? You're hiding in the parking lot?

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,370
我们不是躲起来  只是潜伏
No. No, we're not hiding. We're just... laying low.

144
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,300
我们暂时还安全
Well, we're safe for now.

145
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,680
至少现在还没有下达对我们的逮捕令
There's no arrest warrant that's put out for us just yet.

146
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,660
他们迟早会的
Give 'em time.

147
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,580
简在哪
Where's Jane?

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,750
别问
Don't ask.

149
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,780
她刚已经问了
She just did.

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,500
听我说
Listen to me.

151
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,710
如今加调局已经不复存在了
The C.B.I. is gone now.

152
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,810
我们只能靠自己了  你们得保护好自己
We're on our own. You need to protect yourselves.

153
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,520
你们不知道简在哪里  他在干什么
You don't know where Jane is, you don't know what he's doing,

154
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,040
也不想知道  明白了吗
and you don't want to know, you understand?

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,460
明白  头儿
Yes, boss.

156
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,100
-明白  头儿  -明白  头儿
- Yes, boss. - Yes, boss.

157
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,510
那就好
All right then.

158
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,930
但我已经不是你们的头儿了  关键就在这里
But I am not your boss anymore. That's the point.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,230
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,430
我们明白的
Yeah, we get it.

161
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,800
那他在哪
So where is he?

162
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,530
{\pos(191.4,278.4)}加州  萨克拉门托  威廉兰德公园

163
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,570
你被通缉了
You're a wanted man.

164
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,530
我想也是
Well, I like to think so.

165
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,940
我说真的  艾伯特给你下了逮捕令
Seriously. Abbott put an actual warrant out on you.

166
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,690
也不是第一次了
Eh. It's not the first time.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,550
所以你到底要不要告诉我
So you gonna tell me, or what?

168
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,930
哦对  伯特仑打给我了
Oh, yeah. Uh... Bertram called me.

169
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,120
我知道
I know.

170
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,130
他说了些什么
What did he say?

171
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,540
不管他想说什么  他那时没时间
Well, whatever he wanted to say, he didn't have time.

172
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,790
为什么他还在城里
Why the hell is he still here?

173
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,090
他想做什么
What does he want?

174
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,580
我猜他会很快再打来告诉我
I'm guessing he'll call back soon and tell me.

175
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,240
你的手机不安全  联调局...
Your phone's not safe. The F.B.I.--

176
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,140
对  他们装了窃听
Yeah, they have a tap on the line.

177
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,360
但他们还没追踪到
But they don't have a trace yet.

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
如果他们追踪到了  我现在就早该被捕了
If they had a trace, then I'd be arrested already.

179
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,310
也许如此  但他们早晚会追踪到你的
Maybe so, but sooner or later, they'll get a trace on you.

180
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,150
我知道
I know.

181
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,860
但在伯特仑打来之前我不能扔掉手机
But I can't get rid of my phone until Bertram calls.

182
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,380
所以事情就悬在这了
It's all very suspenseful.

183
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,360
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

184
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,170
谁
Who?

185
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,030
伯特仑
Bertram.

186
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,020
到时候就知道了
We'll see.

187
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,990
你在闪烁其词
Now you're being evasive.

188
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,500
小鸟的眼睛圆又亮
What beady little eyes birds have.

189
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,250
《小恐龙》[系列童书]  你知道吧
Tiny Dinosaurs, you know?

190
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,050
我知道
I know.

191
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,380
我知道你很清楚他的意图
I know you know what he wants.

192
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,450
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

193
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,870
-喂  -很抱歉我那时不得不挂电话
- Hello? - Oh, sorry I had to hang up on you.

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,220
今天实在太忙了
It's been a busy day.

195
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,850
没关系  这个电话不安全
Yeah, no problem. You know, this phone is not safe.

196
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,360
我马上再打给你
Let me call you back in a moment.

197
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,540
好的
Yeah.

198
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,370
他说什么
What'd he say?

199
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,670
稍等一下
Just a second.

200
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,220
你好啊
Hey. How you doing?

201
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,890
我给你一百美元换你的手机  行吗
I'll give you $100 for that phone.

202
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,480
什么
Huh?

203
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,750
两百美元换你的手机
$200 for that phone.

204
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,150
这是什么骗局吗
What's the catch?

205
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,170
不是骗局
No catch.

206
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,650
三百美元  外加
$300 plus...

207
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,690
一部替代机
a replacement phone.

208
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,770
那好吧
Uh, okay.

209
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,970
哥们  我一会儿再打给你
Yeah, dude, I'll call you right back.

210
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,280
交易愉快
Pleasure doing business with you.

211
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,130
谢了  伙计
Thanks, man.

212
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,050
他刚才到底说了什么
What did he say?

213
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,940
我觉得我们应该见面好好谈谈
Look, I think we should meet and talk.

214
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,850
-就我们俩  -就像约会一样吗
- Just the two of us. - What, like a date?

215
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,530
是啊
Yes...

216
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,080
不
No.

217
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,750
听着  游戏结束了
Look, the game is over.

218
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,940
我得说你我确实不分伯仲
I'd call it a very honorable tie.

219
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,700
但现在一切都结束了
And now that it's over,

220
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,860
我真的觉得我们应该好好谈谈
I really think that we should talk.

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,770
停战  不带武器  不玩花招
You know, a truce. No weapons, no tricks.

222
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,110
就谈谈
Just talk.

223
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,960
然后各行其道
Then we both walk away.

224
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,280
谈谈  谈什么
Talk. About what?

225
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,340
什么都谈
Well... everything.

226
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,330
我想我们都需要结束此事了  对吧
I think we both could use a little closure, don't you?

227
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,800
就在今天  现在
It has to be today. You know, now.

228
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,750
我时间有点紧
I'm kind of pressed for time.

229
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,130
我怎么知道能否相信你呢
How do I know I can trust you?

230
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,490
都到现在了就别胆小了  派翠克
Ah, don't be timid now, Patrick.

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,630
我有那么多机会杀你  却都没下手  不是吗
I could have killed you many times, and I haven't, have I?

232
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,260
好吧  时间  地点
Okay. When and where?

233
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,840
非常好
Excellent.

234
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,640
半小时后弗里蒙特公园的喷泉边见
I'll be at the Fremont Park fountain in half an hour.

235
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,390
不行  我不知道那个地方  中央汽车站见
No. Don't know it. Central bus station.

236
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,730
-北入口  -不行  那里人太多
- North entrance. - Nah, There's too many people.

237
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,840
而且警察太多
There's too many cops.

238
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,890
你知道亚历山大公墓吗
You know Alexandria Cemetery?

239
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,970
我当然知道
Of course I do.

240
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,960
西门那边有个小教堂
Yeah, there's a chapel by the western gate.

241
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,540
行啊  半小时之后见
That--that'll do. Half an hour.

242
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,210
别迟到  我不能待太久
Don't be late. I can't wait around.

243
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,350
半小时之后见
Half an hour.

244
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,010
他说什么
What'd he say?

245
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,950
他想见我
He wants to meet with me.

246
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,250
这是个陷阱
It's a trap.

247
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,020
可能吧
Probably.

248
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,310
你准备怎么办
Well, what are you gonna do?

249
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,820
我去见他
I'm gonna meet him.

250
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,850
不行
You can't.

251
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,800
相信我  我知道自己在干什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

252
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,670
简  别去  你想想
Jane, don't do this. Think about it.

253
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,110
联调局马上就要抓到伯特仑了
The F.B.I. is gonna get Bertram soon enough.

254
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,050
我不想他落在联调局手上
I don't want the F.B.I. to get him.

255
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,710
你知道这一天早晚会来
You knew this day was coming.

256
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,030
就是今天了
It's here.

257
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,040
那我和你一起去
Let me come with you.

258
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,520
不行  我不想让你牵扯进来
No, I don't want you involved.

259
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,060
牵扯  我早就深陷其中了
Involved? I am involved.

260
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,010
再也不会了
Not anymore.

261
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,020
我要借你的枪
I'm gonna need to borrow your gun.

262
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,700
我的枪
My gun?

263
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,840
是  你的枪  我不会开枪的
Yes, your gun. I'm not gonna use it.

264
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,950
就是壮壮胆
Just a prop.

265
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,250
特蕾莎  相信我  拜托
Teresa, trust me, please.

谢谢
Thank you.

268
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,560
那边吧
Like that way.

269
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,690
谢了
Thanks.

270
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,780
疑犯逃跑
The suspect got moved.

271
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,390
负责人呢  艾伯特在哪儿
Where's the man in charge here? Where is Abbott?

272
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,530
跪下
Get down on your knees.

273
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,180
把手举到我能看见的地方
Keep your hands where I can see them.

274
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,900
艾伯特在哪儿  我必须得走了
Where is Abbott? I-I have to go.

275
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,840
好了  淡定点  伙计们
All right, take it down a notch, people.

276
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,900
他又不是阿尔·卡彭
He's not Al Capone.

277
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,900
{\an8}著名黑帮老大

278
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,190
艾伯特  请听我说
Abbott, please listen to me.

279
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,490
我看得出来你是个正人君子
I can tell that you're a man of honor.

280
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,320
我以我的名义发誓  我一小时之内就回去自首
On my honor, I will give myself up in an hour.

281
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,140
但是现在  我...  我要
But right now I just-- I just need...

282
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,270
只要
Just...

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,250
算了
Forget it.

284
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,460
别别别  告诉我
No. No, no, no, no. No, tell me.

285
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,350
起来
Come on.

286
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,440
你要干什么  你需要什么
No, what do you need? What do you need, huh?

287
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,910
你需要一小时
You need an hour?

288
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,590
干什么
For what?

289
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,410
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

290
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,660
去见谁
Who are you gonna go meet?

291
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,200
不说吗
No?

292
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,720
那回局里说怎么样
Well, let's take a trip downtown, shall we?

293
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,700
没事  让她过来吧
No. You can let her go.

294
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,760
你好  里斯本女士
Hi, Miss Lisbon.

295
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,890
就算是咱们两个警察间帮个忙  艾伯特
Do me this one favor, Abbott, cop to cop.

296
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,400
放他走  我发誓到时候一定把他带回来
Let him go, and I swear I will bring him back later.

297
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,850
不可能
Not happening.

298
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,070
你们到底有什么紧急的事
And what is all this urgency I'm hearing here?

299
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,510
你们是跟伯特仑有约吧
You made a plan with Bertram.

300
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,230
是吗  是这样吗
Is that it? Is that what you did?

301
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,850
拜托了  艾伯特
Please, Abbott.

302
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,940
联调局  退后
FBI! Back it off!

303
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,130
-加调局  你给我退后  -怎么回事
- CBI. Back it up yourself. - What's this?

304
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,830
放他走  艾伯特  他什么也没做错
Let him go, Abbott. He's done nothing wrong.

305
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,060
好啊  各位
Hey, guys.

306
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,870
很高兴见到你们
You know, I-it's good to see you.

307
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,470
我本来不想提的  但加调局已经不存在了
I hate to bring you down, but there is no CBI.

308
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,050
你们的警徽就是个玩具
That badge is a toy,

309
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,480
而你们只是在假扮警察
and you're all impersonating officers of the law.

310
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,910
随你怎么说  放他走
Whatever. Let him go.

311
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,360
你是缠上我了是吗
Are you mad-dogging me right now?

312
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,910
缠上联调局了
The F.B.I.?

313
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,050
你说你是真的联调局探员  有什么证据
You say you're legit F.B.I., but how do we know?

314
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,640
对  你们也许是布莱克组织的成员
Yeah, you could be members of the Blake Association

315
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,100
也不是没可能
for all we know.

316
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
我们不是
We're not.

317
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,470
拿出证明来
Prove it.

318
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,400
你的手下里德·史密斯就是其中之一
Your man Reede Smith was a member.

319
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
你为什么不可能是
Why not you?

320
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
而且我们怎么知道简会不会有危险
And how do we know Jane's not in danger?

321
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,960
太荒唐了
That's absurd.

322
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,210
抱歉 艾伯特探员
I'm sorry, Agent Abbott,

323
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,050
但是在确保他的安全之前
but it is our duty to protect this man

324
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,440
保护好他是我们的责任
until we're assured his safety.

325
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,430
放他走
Let him go.

326
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,000
别这样  别这样
No, no, no, no, no.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,390
没事的  放下枪
It's all right. Just stand down.

328
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,460
各位都放下枪  没必要起冲突
Stand down, guys. No bloodshed required.

329
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,780
没事的
It's cool.

330
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,690
让他走
Let him go.

331
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,420
开我的车
Take my car.

332
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,200
长官
Sir?

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
就让他走
It's okay.

334
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,500
谢谢各位了
Thank you, guys!

335
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,720
没事了
We done?

336
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,550
他走了  就没事了
He's gone. We're done.

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,310
逮捕他们
Arrest them.

338
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,890
把你们的枪都放到地上
Put your guns down on the ground...

339
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,160
慢慢地
slowly.

340
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,210
照他说的做
Do as he says.

341
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,140
去追踪里斯本探员的车
Go track Agent Lisbon's vehicle.

342
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,280
是  长官
Yes, sir.

343
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,010
你在我车上装了追踪器
You put a bug on my car?

344
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,050
要不我们怎么能找到简
How do you think we found Jane?

345
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,590
我说过认识你们这些人我很高兴
I said I was glad to see you people

346
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,140
因为我知道你们早晚要出篓子
because I knew you would screw up

347
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,200
能省我不少事
and make my life easy.

348
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,350
这不应验了吗
And you did just that.

349
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,980
谢谢
Thank you.

350
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,180
逮捕她
Arrest her.

351
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,260
走吧
Come on.

352
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,810
他还没准备好呢
He wasn't ready for it.

353
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,180
没错
No.

354
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,080
看啊
Check it out.

355
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,270
看看这个
Check this out.

356
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,500
你好吗
What's up?

357
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,610
能帮我看会儿车吗
Uh, could you guys keep an eye on my car for me, please?

358
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,320
当然了  会看好的
Sure, I'll watch it.

359
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,480
谢谢
Thank you.

360
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,650
动手
Let's go.

361
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,540
好了  伙计  别担心
Yeah, man, no worries.

362
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,220
等等
Hey there.

363
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,040
不好意思麻烦你了  女士
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

364
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,450
我长话短说
Uh, long story.

365
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,270
你愿不愿意载我一程
Uh, I need--I need a ride, if you're willing.

366
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,030
这里是四队  我们看见那辆车了
This is Unit 4. We have the vehicle in sight,

367
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,300
停在第五大道和谢尔曼街交会处
stationary on Fifth and Sherman.

368
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,970
退后  先退后  他们可能就在那儿接头
Stay back, stay back. This could be the meet.

369
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,780
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

370
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,220
四队  什么情况
Unit 4, what's the situation?

371
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,580
四队  回答  该死的
Unit 4, respond, damn it.

372
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,510
头儿  里斯本车里就几个孩子
Boss, it was some kids in Lisbon's car.

373
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,890
简不在里面
Jane wasn't there.

374
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,080
没有发现简  重复  我们没发现简
We don't have Jane. Repeat. We don't have Jane.

375
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,950
是否收...
Do you co--

376
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,220
别再越错越多了
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

377
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,790
他去哪儿了
Where did he go?

378
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,280
不知道
I don't know.

379
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
你们是不见棺材不落泪是吧
You guys really have a death wish, don't you?

380
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,620
长官  我们真的不知道
Sir, we really don't know.

381
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,620
长官  你居然还叫他长官
"Sir"? Why the hell are you calling him "Sir"?

382
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,100
别激动  "头号公敌"
Oh, calm down, Dillinger.

383
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,100
{\an8}约翰.格林杰是萧条时期联调局追捕的最著名的黑帮头目  曾两度越狱

384
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,980
我们现在是阶下囚  还是识相点吧
We're under arrest here. We might as well be civil.

385
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,090
干嘛  你是想住好一点的牢房
Why? You think you'll get a nicer cell?

386
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,060
非常感谢[西语]  奥雷利奥
Muchas gracias, Aurelio.

387
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,250
别客气  祝你好运[西语]
De nada. Buena suerte.

Hey, Patrick.

391
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,970
得先得搜搜你身上有没有武器
I'm gonna need to search you for weapons.

392
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,050
然后你才能进去  把手举起来
So you can go ahead, put your hands up.

393
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,870
试下也无妨
Worth a shot.

394
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,660
你可以进去了
You can go in now.

395
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,330
派翠克
Patrick.

396
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,050
谢谢你这么准时
Thank you for being so punctual.

397
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,340
你骗了我
You lied to me.

398
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,230
你不也是
Oh. Well... as did you.

399
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,880
我们还真是俩无赖  对吧
What a couple of scamps we are, huh?

400
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,720
我保证  这是最后一次骗你了
I promise that is the last lie that I will ever tell you.

401
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,040
先说正事
So... first things first.

402
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,060
你和联调局犯了个严重的错误
You and the feds have made a big mistake.

403
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,690
我不是血腥约翰
I'm not Red John.

404
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,800
你说什么
What?

405
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,010
我不是血腥约翰
I'm not Red John.

406
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,550
很抱歉让你失望了
I-I'm sorry to disappoint you,

407
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,200
但是我只是布莱克组织
but I'm just a humble foot soldier

408
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,430
一员卑微走卒罢了
in the Blake Association.

409
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,010
血腥约翰可是高层
Red John is one of the top brass.

410
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,850
我不是很相信你
I'm not sure I believe you.

411
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,840
信不信随你  但
Well... that's your privilege, but--

412
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
但是我说的是真的
But I am telling you the truth.

413
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,150
你们草率得出的结论是错的
You all just jumped to the wrong conclusion.

414
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,850
那么谁是血腥约翰
Okay, so who is Red John?

415
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,440
我不知道
Oh, I have no idea.

416
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,780
真的
No, h-honestly.

417
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,380
不知道
No idea.

418
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,260
组织严格遵循的原则是只须知道必需的信息
The association works on a strictly need-to-know basis.

419
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,730
如果你说的是真的
Supposing what you say is true,

420
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,150
那么我们完全可以在电话里说
then we could have had this talk on the phone.

421
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,810
但是如果我们在电话里说
Yeah, but if we talked on the phone,

422
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,410
那你  你可能就不会来见我了
Then you... you probably wouldn't have come to meet me,

423
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,530
不是吗
Would you?

424
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,470
我接到命令要打电话给你
And I was told to call you,

425
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,580
告诉你游戏结束  安排和你见面
tell you the game's over, and arrange a meeting.

426
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,670
为什么
Why?

427
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,000
为什么要我过来
Why am I here?

428
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,650
请你不要以为
Please... don't think for a moment

429
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,190
我乐意这么做
that I am happy about this.

430
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,420
组织不想有遗留问题
The association doesn't like loose ends.

431
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,580
不想留下把柄
Just hates them.

432
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,090
所以
So...

433
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,810
动手吧  奥斯卡
Go on, Oscar.

434
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,330
别  别  听着  听着
No, no. Listen. Listen. Let's--

435
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,790
我们谈谈  等等
Let's talk about this. Just... w-wait.

436
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,400
我很抱歉  这不是我能决定的
Now I am truly sorry, but it is totally out of my hands.

437
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,080
我一直都很喜欢你  派翠克
I always liked you, patrick.

438
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,890
别  别  不需要这么做
No. No. This is not necessary.

439
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,100
我们不
We don't--don't--

440
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,360
什...
H-hey...wh-

441
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,870
谢谢  奥斯卡
Thank you, Oscar.

442
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,180
你可以出去等着了  就...
You can wait outside. Just, uh...

443
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,340
确保没人来打扰我们
Make sure we're left in peace.

444
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,150
你好  派翠克
Hello, Patrick.

445
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,900
你好
Hi.

446
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
现在什么情况
Hey, what's going on?

447
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,710
格蕾斯  你在干
Grace, what are you--

448
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,150
别这么做
What--please don't do that.

449
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,140
你还不如周呢
You're worse than Cho.

450
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,770
他们必须告诉我们到底怎么了
They need to tell us what's going on.

451
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,750
他们不需要做任何事
They don't need to do anything.

452
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,090
我们也什么都做不了  行行好就放松点吧
And we can't do anything, so please just relax.

453
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,130
放松  我怎么放松得下来
Relax? How can I relax?

454
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,880
你有时候表现的好像你很享受无助感
You know, sometimes I think you like being helpless.

455
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,770
好了  我收回  别放松
Okay, fine, I take it back. Don't relax.

456
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,970
用额头把车窗撞破
Just break the window with your forehead

457
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,050
我们就可以跳车跑了
and we'll all jump out and make a run for it.

458
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,000
伙计们  团结一点好吗
Guys, let's try to keep it together, okay?

459
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
好的  很抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry.

460
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,910
"抱歉"
"Sorry."

461
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,040
莫林斯  你是本地人  对吗
Mullins, you're from here, yes?

462
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,310
是的  林肯高地的
Yes, sir. Over to Lincoln Heights.

463
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,070
-给我弄一张萨克拉门托的地图  -是  长官
- Get me a map of Sacramento. - Yes, sir.

464
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,900
车里的电脑上就有
There's one on the computer in the car.

465
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,400
纸质地图
Paper map.

466
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,560
纸质  地图
Paper... map.

467
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,200
快点去找
Come on. Let's go.

468
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,160
你有纸质地图吗
Hey, do you have a paper map?

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,540
派翠克  终于又见面了
Well, Patrick, here we are.

470
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,190
可怜的家伙
Poor fella.

471
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,570
说他聪明又傻
Smart but dumb.

472
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,090
他从来没想到
It never occurred to him

473
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,790
我也是布莱克组织的一员
that I am the Blake Association.

474
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,590
你为什么要杀他
Why'd you have to kill him?

475
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,350
每个人都认为他是血腥约翰  不是吗
Everyone thinks he's Red John, don't they?

476
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,520
所以你们两个同归于尽
So... it would seem a fitting end to the story

477
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,850
会是这个故事完美的结局
if you two were found dead together.

478
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,400
没人会再深究下去
No one will look any deeper.

479
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,330
所以我也必须死  是吗
So I'm supposed to die, am I?

480
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,020
耗了这么多年
After all these years,

481
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,160
是不是不太公平
seems kind of unfair.

482
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,100
很公平
It's totally fair.

483
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,850
游戏结束  我赢了
The game's over, and I won.

484
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,690
这可不是游戏
It's not a game.

485
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,700
有人输  有人赢  这就是游戏
There's a winner and a loser. That's a game.

486
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,750
我可没要玩这个游戏
It's not a game I asked to play.

487
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,820
即使如此  你还是玩得很好
No, but you played it very well nonetheless.

488
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,880
你很有趣  很有挑战性  谢谢
You were fun, challenging. Thank you.

489
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,320
你肯定有很多问题想问我  对吗
You probably have a lot of questions for me, huh?

490
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,900
我们多得是问的时间
We have time, if you want.

491
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,610
我没有问题
I have no questions.

492
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,310
你是个邪恶  性变态的反社会人渣
You're an evil, sexually perverted sociopath

493
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,490
还很可悲地妄自尊大
with pathetic delusions of grandeur.

494
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,870
这就是你的本质
The rest is just details.

495
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,950
邪恶  性变态的反社会人渣
"Evil, sexually perverted sociopath"?

496
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,240
这一点我到是承认  但是
Well, I guess I have to own that, but, uh...

497
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,010
妄自尊大
"delusions of grandeur"?

498
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,070
我不承认
No.

499
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,550
我没有妄想症
I have no delusions.

500
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,870
我建立了这个地下帝国
I built a secret empire.

501
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,780
我控制着千万人的生命
I control the lives of thousands of people.

502
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,470
我说的话可以决定生死
My word is life and death,

503
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,850
却没有人知道我是谁
and nobody knows who I am.

504
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,680
这就是伟大
Now if that's not grandeur,

505
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,050
不然还能是什么
I don't know what you call it.

506
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,960
我会说这是卑鄙的自大狂的胡言乱语
I'd call it the ravings of a squalid egomaniac.

507
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,470
瞧
You see?

508
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,170
你总是这样没来由地粗鲁  目空一切
For no reason at all, you... you're rude and contemptuous.

509
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,040
这就是害死你老婆孩子的原因
That's why your wife and kid are dead.

510
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,360
你又有什么资格
Who are you to butt in here

511
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,370
在这对我评头论足
and make obnoxious judgments about me?

512
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,390
你算什么
Who are you?

513
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,130
你算得上什么
Who are you?

514
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,190
谁也算不上
Nobody.

515
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,690
谁也算不上
Nobody.

516
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,620
你以前不了解我
You didn't know me.

517
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,360
现在也不了解我
You don't know me.

518
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,620
完全不了解
You have no idea.

519
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,440
派  你的问题在于
Here's your problem, Pat.

520
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,020
你很聪明  但是太傲慢
You're a smart man, but you are arrogant.

521
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,550
你不能接受别人比你聪明
You can't imagine someone smarter than you.

522
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,400
这就是为什么每一步
Which is why I've been ahead of you

523
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,890
我都能抢在你前面
at every step along the way.

524
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,000
你有枪  想自吹自擂
You're holding the gun. You want to brag?

525
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,930
尽管吹吧  我不会阻止你
Go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you.

526
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,680
你还是不知道我怎么骗过你的  是吗
You still don't know how I fooled you, do you?

527
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,750
我怎么从爆炸中逃脱的
How did I survive that bomb?

528
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,420
我怎么猜出你的名单的
How did I know all the names on your list?

529
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,280
你一直缺少的就是这个对吧  你想要有人能欣赏你
Is this what you've been missing? Appreciation?

530
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,270
想让我为你喝彩吗
Do you want me to applaud?

531
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,160
你完全不知道  是吗
You have no idea, do you?

532
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,030
我不知道你是怎么猜到嫌疑人名单的
I don't know how you got the list of suspects.

533
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,570
干得漂亮
That was a good trick.

534
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,940
但是炸弹那事很简单
But the bomb gag is simple.

535
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,220
有两次爆炸
There were two explosions.

536
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,620
第一次是个震央炸弹  为了把所有人炸晕
The first was a concussion bomb, knocked everyone out.

537
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
第二个
The second

538
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,400
才是那个炸死哈弗内和斯特尔斯的致命炸弹
lethal bomb that killed Haffner and Stiles

539
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,440
你把我  伯特仑和史密斯
only went off after you dragged Bertram,

540
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,900
拖出爆炸伤害范围之后才引爆的
Smith and me out of harm's way.

541
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,240
没错
Correct.

542
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,810
伪造你的死亡就更简单了
Faking your own death was easy.

543
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,690
布雷特·帕特里奇是布莱克组织的
Brett Partridge was Blake Association.

544
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,970
他可以接触到原始DNA数据库
His job gave him access to the primary D.N.A. database.

545
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,680
他把你的DNA记录
He switched your D.N.A. Records

546
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,940
和你留着的一具尸体的记录对调了
with a body that you had on ice.

547
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,200
一具替代品
A surrogate.

548
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,320
你用把尸体放在汽车后备箱
And you brought the body to my house

549
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,470
带到了我家
in the trunk of your car

550
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,620
然后把尸体放在哈弗内和斯特尔斯旁边
and you put it alongside Stiles and Haffner.

551
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,800
很好
Very good.

552
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,750
虽然是后知后觉
Your hindsight is 20/20.

553
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,720
能给你看件东西吗
Can I show you something?

554
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,460
当然
Sure.

555
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,870
面包屑
Bread crumbs?

556
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,190
鸟
Birds.

557
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,710
真聪明
Very clever.

558
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,260
炸弹是你犯的一个错误
The bomb was a mistake.

559
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,270
是你演的一出戏
It was theater.

560
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,580
我知道不管事实看起来如何
I knew that whatever the truth looked like,

561
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,350
与之相反的才是真相
The opposite must be true.

562
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,370
求你别
Please don't.

563
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,220
别杀我
Don't kill me.

564
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,330
现在你来祈求宽恕了
Oh, now you want mercy?

565
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,730
在你犯下那么多恶行之后
After all you've done?

566
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,490
你和我不一样
You're not like me.

567
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,410
你是个好人
You're a good man.

568
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,560
杀了我  那会一直折磨着你
It'll haunt you.

569
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,150
我可不是在犹豫
Oh, I'm not hesitating.

570
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,620
我只是在享受这一刻
I'm just savoring the moment.

571
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,080
你就是血腥约翰
