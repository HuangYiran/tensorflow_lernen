1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,030
Lisbon啊...
Lisbon...

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,700
都结束了 完结了
It's over. It's done.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,030
我只是给你报个平安
I just want you to know I'm okay.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,530
我会想念你的
And I'm gonna miss you.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,030
两年后

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,430
那就是警察的职责
And that's what police do.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,230
我们帮助遇到麻烦的人
We help people that are in trouble,

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,630
阻止惹是生非的人
and we stop people from making trouble.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,130
有时很辛苦
It's a hard job sometimes,

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,360
但我认为这是世界上最好的工作
but I think it's the best job there is.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,730
你们呢? 有没有人想
What about you? Does anybody want to be

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,030
长大以后做警察呀?
a police officer when they grow up?

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,230
你们还有时间考虑一下
Well, there's time to think about it.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,760
有问题吗?
Any questions?

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,930
有 有 有!
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,960
你开枪打过人吗?
Did you ever shoot somebody?

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,830
嗯 确实有
Well, actually, yes.

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,530
他们有死掉吗?
Did they die?

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,530
重点是 世界上有坏人
Point is, there are bad people in the world.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,000
不是全部 但却有
Not all, but some.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,260
有时候你不得不做一些
And sometimes you have to do things

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,800
你不想做的事
you don't want to do

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,700
来确保避免更糟糕的事情发生
to make sure worse things don't happen.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,630
- 是不是流了很多血呀?  - 我想今天的时间差不多了
- Was there lots of blood?  - I'm afraid that's all the time we have.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,730
- 我们要说什么呀?  - 谢谢 Lisbon警长!
- What do we say?  - Thank you, Chief Lisbon!

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,600
嘿 Henry 怎么了?
Hey, Henry, what's up?

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,660
外面有个人想找你
There's a man here wants to speak with you.

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,300
一个叫Abbott的探员
An Agent Abbott,

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,130
呃 是联邦调查局的
uh, with the FBI.

30
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,660
- Abbott探员?  - 他自己这样说的
- Abbott?  - That's what he said.

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,960
- 让他进来  - 好的
- Send him in.  - Okay.

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,330
什么事?
Yes?

33
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,060
你确定要让他现在进来吗?
Do you want me to send him in now?

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,300
对
Yes.

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,200
嗨 Lisbon

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
对吧?
Hmm?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,660
你在这多久 18个月了吧?
You've been here, what, 18 months?

40
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,430
有Jane的消息吗?
Have you heard from Jane?

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,030
没有
Nope.

42
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,730
一点消息都没? 没有邮件 没有电话?
Nothing? No e-mail, no phone call?

43
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,200
没有
No.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,130

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,600
Rigsby或者Van Pelt呢?
What about Rigsby or Van Pelt?

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,530
他们有没有收到消息?
Have they heard anything?

47
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,360
我今晚就会和他们一起吃晚饭
I'm having dinner with them tonight.

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,500
要不你加入我们吧? 你可以亲自问他们
Why don't you join us? You could ask them yourself.

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,860
嗯... 那Cho呢?
Mm... Hmm. And Cho?

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,730
我很长时间没收到他的消息了
Haven't heard from him in ages.

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,100
我不知道Jane在哪 坦白说 我也不在乎
I don't know where Jane is, and frankly, I don't care.

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,530
是吗? 呃...
No? Well...

53
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,000
你俩以前那么亲密
you two were so close.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,360
那是很久以前的事了
It was a long time ago.

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,100
哦
Hmm.

56
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,230
你们打算什么时候才放弃追捕他?
When are you guys gonna give up chasing him?

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,100
我们可是联邦调查局 不会轻言放弃
Oh, we're the F.B.I. We don't give up.

58
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,800
嗯
Hmm.

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,960
贝壳真漂亮

随便
Sure.

64
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,000
有人说贝壳会一直带着
You know, they say a shell always carries around

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,860
海浪的声音

希望你一切安好

这里一切都好
All's well here.

72
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,400
我每天过得很有规律

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,220
天气终于有点转凉了
Weather's finally turned a little cooler.

74
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,790
但一点都不冷
Far from cold.

75
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,960
海边还是很温暖
And the ocean is still warm

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,680
温暖到招来了
and with the warmer incurrence

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,460
一大群海洋生物
comes in a bundle of sea lives.

78
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,280
就在昨天我看到一群海豚
Yesterday I saw a pod of dolphins play 

79
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
在岸边很近的地方嬉戏...
so close to the shore...

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
近到我快可以摸到它们了
I could almost touch them.

81
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,280
我想你也会喜欢这些的
That is the kind of things I think you could enjoy.

82
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,990

Unbelievable.

97
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,470

祝你们今天愉快 女士们 

99
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,360
也祝你愉快!

100
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,470
一直问有没有人找他 真可怜

101
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,490
一直那么帅

102
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,020
对 很帅

但他的西班牙语太烂了!

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,690
没有比他更烂的了

107

喂 Patrick! Patrick!

真要来吗 小伙子们?
Oh, really, guys?

110
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,500
我不会变其它魔术了

111
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,240
求求你啦!

112

很执着 我只能说 非常执着
Very persistent, I must say. Very persistent.

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,540

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,230
Alfredo啊...
Alfredo...

155
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,110
你今天怎样?

156
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,480
我猜下

157
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,190
你要炒鸡蛋和奶茶

158
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,910
太感谢你了

159
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,700
你尝下咖啡会死吗?

160
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,130
嗨
Hi.

161
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,260
你好
Hello.

162
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
你是美国人吗?
From the U.S.?

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
我无可挑剔的西班牙语没有骗到你吗?
You weren't fooled by my impeccable Spanish?

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,760
没有 不管怎样...
No. Anyway...

165
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,300
你在看书呢 抱歉
You're reading. Sorry.

166
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,630
问题是 呃 我怀念讲英语
Thing is, uh, I miss speaking english.

167
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,130
Roger是这里唯一一个说英语的人
Roger's the only other English speaker,

168
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,430
但他... 他不太爱讲话
And he's... well, he's not a great talker.

169
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,930
事实证明受人理解是一件无人珍视的美事
Turns out being understood is an underrated pleasure.

170
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,060
我懂的 
I can imagine. Mm.

171
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,760
我不打扰你了
I'll leave you alone.

172
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800
没关系
No problem.

173
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,330
貌似你快看完了
Looks like you're nearly finished.

174
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,130
我看完之后你想看吗?
Do you want it when I'm finished?

175
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,160
我很乐意
I wouldn't mind it.

176
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,860
在这很难找到英文书
It's not easy to get books in English around here.

177
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,700
好啊
Okay.

178
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,560
书好看吗?
Is it any good?

179
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,030
你喜欢神秘谋杀案吗?
You like murder mysteries?

180
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,360
不太喜欢
Not really.

181
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,030
那你可能不喜欢这本书了
Then you probably won't like it.

182
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,560
无论怎样我都会看的
Well, I'll take it anyway.

183
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,300
饥不择食 对吧?
Beggars can't be choosers, can they?

184
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,960
对 没得选
No, they can't.

185
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,030
你要过来和我一起吗?
Do you want to join me?

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,930
好啊
Sure.

187
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,930
我叫Patrick
Patrick.

188
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,730
- 我叫Kim  - 嗨
- Kim.  - Hi.

189
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,030
你来自东南岸吧?
So you're from the, uh, southeast?

190
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,730
弗吉尼亚州?
Virginia?

191
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,060
耳朵真灵 猜对了
Good ear. Yeah.

192
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,330
你呢?
You?

193
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,560
呃 我... 我到处跑 现在住在这
Well, I... I lived all over. Right now I live here.

194
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,330
我之前在这个岛的另一边
I was on the other side of the island,

195
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,630
不过人们告诉我这边的沙滩好多了
but people told me the beaches on this side were better.

196
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,960
- 确实如此  - 你和妻子一起来的吗?
- That's true.  - You here with your wife?

197
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,800
不 只有我
No, just me.

198
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,830
对 不 我妻子 呃...
Oh, yeah, no. My wife, uh...

199
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,930
呃... 我不再是已婚了
Uh... not married anymore.

200
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,100
你呢?
You?

201
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,930
我? 没结婚
Me? No.

202
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,760
很好
Great.

203
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,200
我是说 如果... 如果你喜欢不结婚 保持单身...
I mean, it's great if you... if you like not being married...

204
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,760
就挺好的
being single.

205
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,300
- 的确很享受  - 很好
- I do.  - Great.

206
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,360
- 非常感谢  - 不客气
- Ah, muchas gracias.  - Si. De nada.

207
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,700
我来这儿是逃避的 思考些事情
I came here to get away, think about things.

208
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,600
你在思考什么?
What are you thinking about?

209
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,860
最近工作上有个升职的机会
I've been offered a promotion at work,

210
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,500
但我不确定想不想要
but I'm not sure I want it.

211
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,660
为什么犹豫?
Why is that?

212
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,260
哦... 更多工作
Oh... It's more work.

213
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,030
更多烦恼
It's more hassle.

214
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,160
虽然有更多钱 但值得吗?
Eh, more money, but is it worth it?

215
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,760
看来你问自己的这个问题
Well, sounds like you're asking yourself

216
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,460
是问对了
the right questions.

217
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,130
住这里有点奇怪
Must be strange to live here.

218
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,300
太漂亮了...
It's so beautiful. I...

219
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,600
如果一直待在这儿
I think if I were here full-time,

220
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
我会觉得自己
I'd feel like I was living

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,630
住在梦境里 你明白吗?
in some kind of dream world, you know?

222
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,060
有时候的确如此
Ah, sometimes it's like that.

223
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,060
梦境没什么不好的 对吧?
There's nothing wrong with dream worlds, right?

224
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,730
你就是长住的
You're here to stay.

225
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,560
也许吧
Maybe.

226
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
真是个神秘的男人
Man of mystery.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,700
真的?
Really?

228
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
我可没想故作神秘
I don't mean to be mysterious.

229
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,360
我妻子死了
My wife died.

230
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,460
发生了一些事 我做了些事...
Some things happened, I did some things, and...

231
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,260
我暂时还不是很想谈这些
I don't really know how to talk about it yet.

232
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,960
我猜这就是我还戴着戒指的原因
I guess that's why I still wear the ring.

233
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,300
我只是... 还没准备好
I'm just... not ready.

234
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,660
我想我明白
I think I understand.

235
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,060
这就是我来这儿的原因
Anyway, that's why I'm here.

236
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,230
这地方可真不赖
It's not a bad place to be.

237
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,660
对吧? 这儿很漂亮
Right? It's beautiful.

238
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,060
是个天堂
It's paradise.

239
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,930
正是如此
Exactly.

240
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,200
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

241
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,430
你说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

242
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,100
是的 先生 很流利
Yes, sir. I speak very good, sir.

243
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,400
很好 你叫什么?
Ah. Good. What's your name?

244
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,130
Morales 先生 我叫Franklin Morales
Morales. Franklin Morales, sir.

245
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,500
Morales 对吧?
Morales, huh?

246
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,130
你见过这个人吗?
Have you seen this guy?

247
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,030
没见过 先生
No, sir.

248
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,760
那好
Okay then.

249
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,130
如果你见到他了...
If you see him...

250
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,860
- 就告诉我 好吗?  - 好的 先生
- you'll tell me, yes?  - Yes, sir.

251
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,230

非常感谢
Muchas gracias.

253
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,400
好了 伙计们 我们安顿一下
All right, fellas, let's get settled,

254
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,900
就去吃东西
then we'll go get something to eat.

255
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,000
嘿 Roger 你怎么样?
Hey, Roger, what's up?

256

258
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,960

My eyes were... fluid cobras.

259
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,660
是呀 很高兴见到你
Yeah. Good to see you.

260
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,360
他来了多久了?
How long has he been here?

261
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
不知道 挺长时间了
Uh, not sure. Long time.

262
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
看得出来
You can tell.

263
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,900
稍等
Un momento.

264
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,960

有三个美国警察来了酒店
Three big American police checked in.

270
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,230
在找你呢
Looking for you.

271
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,260

They're there now?

272
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,360
没错
Yes.

273
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,630

Okay, well, see what else you can find out.

274
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,030

276
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,130
再见
Bye.

277
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,830
没事吧?
Is everything all right?

278
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,030
没事 只是...
Uh, yeah. Fine. Uh, just some...

279

有些人想要见我
some people who want to meet with me.

280
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,060
听着 我得回市区了
Listen, I have to head back up to town.

281
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,500
你想和我一起回去吗?
Do you want to come with me?

282
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,030
当然
Sure.

283
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,500
回头见
See you around.

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,530
- 一定  - 再见
- I'm sure I will.  - Bye.

285
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,320
站直

286
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,960
真漂亮

287
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,110
非常漂亮

288
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,470
加上肩章肯定更好看

289
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,480
你还真是固执己见

290
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,330
- 衬衫真好看  - 谢谢
- That's a nice shirt.  - Thanks.

291
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,260
去换衣服吧

292
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,930
和你聊得很愉快
Well, this was nice.

293
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,060
我知道你还有人要见
I know you have people to see.

294
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,560
很不幸 的确是这样
Yes, uh, unfortunately, I do, yeah.

295
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,360
没问题 但我在想...
No problem. Hey, um, but I was wondering...

296
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,530
你知道附近有哪家不错的餐厅能吃晚餐吗?
do you, uh, know a good place around here for dinner?

297
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,360
你在邀请我共进晚餐吗?
Are you asking me out for dinner?

298
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,330
是的
Yeah.

299
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,800
我想你知道当地人会去的好地方
I figure you'll know a good place where the locals go.

300
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,330
没错 我的确知道...
Yeah, uh, I do. Um...

301
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,560
我... 知道...
Yes, I do... know...

302
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,430
我们要不约了在这儿碰面...
Well, why don't we meet here at, uh...

303
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,930
就... 八点吧?

304
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,660
- 说定了  - 好
- Deal.  - Okay.

305
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,960
八点
8:00.

306
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,730
一会儿见
See ya then.

307
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,530
在找你的人叫Abbott
The man who asks about you is Abbott.

308
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,360
入住资料上登记的就是这个名字
That is the name on the register.

309
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,660
他现在在哪儿?
Hmm. Where is he now?

310
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,630
他在吃饭 本来还有两个人跟他在一起
Eating. The other two men are with him,

311
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,000
- 但他们走了  - 谢谢
- but they leave.  - Ahh. Thank you.

312
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,460
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,860
那家伙是谁?
Who's that guy?

314
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,700
他叫Danny Otero
Danny Otero.

315
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,960
卖毒品的
Sells drugs.

316
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,530
来这儿从越南人手上买海洛因的
Comes here to buy heroin from Vietnamese.

317
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,300
人不怎么样
Bad business.

318
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,200
英语怎么说? 呃... 给小费很抠门
How you say? Um... lousy tipper.

319
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,360
给小费很抠门
Lousy tipper.

320
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,300
对 没错
Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,560
很抠门
Lousy tipper.

322
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,630
嘿 Abbott
Abbott.

323
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,000
你怎么样?
How the heck are you?

324
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,130
我还以为我们得翻遍岛上每一寸土地
And here we thought we were gonna have to turn over

325
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,260
才能找到你呢
every rock on this island to find you.

326
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,860
我听说你来了
I heard you were here.

327
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,030
觉得礼貌起见 应该过来打声招呼
Well, it's only polite to stop by and say hi.

328
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,800
旅途如何?
Oh, how was the flight?

329
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,430
太颠簸了
Bumpy.

330
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,360
你这样直接来见面还真是自信
Pretty confident of you to front up like this.

331
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,330
我有引渡法护身
The extradition laws are on my side.

332
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,730
我知道你没法抓我
I know you can't touch me.

333
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,800
谁说我想抓你的?
Who said I wanted to touch you?

334
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,560
- 我是来和你谈条件的  - 这样
- I'm here to make you an offer.  - Oh.

335
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,260
管事的人认为
The powers-that-be

336
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,100
你对联邦调查局的价值很大
decided that you could be valuable to the FBI.

337
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,300
如果你愿意来为我们工作 联邦调查局很愿意
The Bureau is willing to drop all the charges against you

338
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,100
撤销对你的一切指控
if you come and work for us.

339
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
为联邦调查局工作?
For the FBI?

340
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,530
没错
That's right.

341
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
这是条款
There are the terms.

342
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,230
要知道 我想说清楚
You know, I want to be very clear.

343
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,330
我不喜欢这个交易
I don't like this deal.

344
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,160
如果要我说 就该给你脑袋套上麻袋
If it were up to me, you would be headed home

345
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,060
用货运机运回美国
in a cargo plane with a sack over your head.

346
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,260
但我也只是来传话的
But, hey, I'm just the messenger.

347
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,600
很诱人的提议 但我不信
Interesting proposition. I'm not buying it.

348
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,800
不信?
No?

349
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,100
无论我是什么态度...
Whatever my feelings are about it...

350
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,930
这条件很不错了 Jane
this is a good deal, Jane.

351
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,530
你真的应该考虑一下
You really need to consider it.

352
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,130
我已经过腻那种生活了
I am done with that life.

353
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,030
我做了该做的事
I did what I had to do,

354
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,630
也已经放下了过去
and I've moved on.

355
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,300
那种生活是一份你干得很好的工作
That life was a job that you were very good at.

356
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,130
如果你回来 可以帮助很多人
If you come back, you can help a lot of people.

357
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,460
你有天赋
You have a gift.

358
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,800
那不是天赋
It's not a gift.

359
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,560
无论如何 这会让你离开这座岛
Whatever it is, it'll get you off this island,

360
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,260
然后重新开始生活
and you can start your life again.

361
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,200
我已经做到了 谢谢
I have. Thank you.

362
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,530
好吧
Okay.

363
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,930
我们还会在这儿待一天 如果你改主意了就来找我
We'll be here for another day if you change your mind.

364
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,600
你怎么找到我的?
How'd you find me?

365
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,800
你给你女朋友Lisbon写的信
The letters to your girlfriend Lisbon.

366
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
要知道 你先把信寄给马戏团的朋友
You know, it was pretty smart

367
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,330
再让他们偷偷带给Lisbon
to send them to your carny friends

368
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,300
这招挺聪明的
and have them sneak them over to her.

369
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,700
但还不够聪明
Just not quite smart enough.

370
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,700
我终于黑进了防火墙
So I finally managed to hack through the firewall,

371
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,560
结果发现偷取信用卡号码的
and it turns out the cyber mastermind

372
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,260
黑客高手竟然是一个明尼阿波利斯的11岁孩子
stealing credit card numbers is an 11-year-old from Minneapolis.

373
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,630
什么?
What?

374
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,660
没错 他把信息卖给朋友
Yeah. He was selling them to his friends

375
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,060
他们都用来买限量版球鞋了
so they could buy limited-edition sneakers.

376
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,000
- 他被捕了吗?  - 我不知道
- Did he get arrested?  - I don't know.

377
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,860
我们把信息给了明尼阿波利斯警局
We turned the information over to the Minneapolis P.D.

378
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,900
事实上他们抓到了 我查过
Actually, they did. I checked.

379
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,260
他会被当成少年犯来审判
And he's gonna be tried as a juvenile.

380
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,800
就是这样
Oh, well, there you go.

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,930
所以电子监控公司的生意不错吧?
So the digital surveillance company is going well, huh?

382
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,400
不错 我们已经开张
Yeah. We've been up and running now

383
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,130
大概15个月了...
for, uh, 15 months, and...

384
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,130
不管你信不信 收入非常稳定
already turning a tidy profit, believe it or not.

385
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,430
是很不错
Yeah. Nice.

386
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,360
你过得如何?
How are things here?

387
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,860
还是老样子 大多数都是酒后偷车的案子...
Same. You know, it's mostly D.U.I.s, stolen bikes...

388
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,530
但我挺喜欢的
but I like it that way.

389
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,060
很安静祥和
It's nice and quiet.

390
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,560
是保姆打来的 抱歉 喂?
It's the babysitter. Excuse me. Hello?

391
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Maddy有点低烧
Maddy's got a slight fever.

392
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,230
Grace很担心 我告诉她没事的
Grace worries. I try and tell her it's nothing,

393
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,400
- 但终归是第一个孩子 还是担心  - 我明白
- but first baby, you know?  - Sure.

394
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,100
- 我能问你件事吗 Wayne?  - 问吧
- Can I ask you something, Wayne?  - Mm.

395
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,400
- 你想念加州调查局吗?  - 恩
- Do you ever miss the CBI?  - Hmm.

396
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,500
当然 有时候会想
Sure. Sometimes.

397
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,430
我是说 我和Grace都很忙
I mean, Grace and I are so busy,

398
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,530
真的没有太多时间去想这些
I don't really have much time to think about it.

399
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,830
事情太忙了
Things are so hectic.

400
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,130
我原来挺想念的 但现在不了
I used to miss it, but not anymore.

401
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,800
这里挺好的
Yeah. Everything here's good.

402
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,060
要知道... 就是挺好的
You know, it's just... it's good.

403
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,430
那很好 头儿
That's great, boss.

404
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,830
我不是你们的头儿了
I am not your boss anymore.

405
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,560
她说孩子烧到39度了
She says her fever's up to 102.7.

406
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,500
抱歉 我们得走了
Oh. I'm sorry. We're out of here.

407
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,260
- 真对不起  - 没事的
- I'm so sorry.  - No, it's fine.

408
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,800
我送你们上车
But I'll walk you to your car.

409
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,830
所以... 说到那些想和你见面的人
So... those people that wanted to meet with you,

410
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,230
你后来和他们见面了吗?
did you meet with them?

411
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,400
见了
Yeah.

412
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,100
谈得如何?
How'd it go?

413
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,860
呃 挺有意思的
Uh, it was interesting.

414
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,830
他们给我找了份工作
They made me a job offer.

415
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,230
嗯?
Hmm?

416
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,460
简单地说 要是我同意为他们工作
Basically, if I go and work for them,

417
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,960
我就可以回到美国
then I can go back to the U.S.

418
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,330
听起来不错
Sounds good.

419
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,000
其实未必
Not really.

420
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,900
我已经差不多放下过去了
I've kind of moved on.

421
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,800
回去就相当于重蹈覆辙
It would be going backwards.

422
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,030
我觉得那样不太好
And I don't think that's healthy.

423
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,130
那你... 到底是做什么的呢?
What is it that you... do, anyway?

424
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,130
- 我是做什么的?  - 没错
- What do I do?   - Yeah.

425
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,200
嗯
Hmm.

426
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,330
我... 我负责找人
I, uh... I look for people.

427
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,360
听起来很有趣
Sounds intriguing.

428
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,030
的确 过去是的
It is. Was.

429
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,000
过去觉得有趣
It was fun.

430
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,230
可归根结底你还是得回家啊
Still, you get to go home.

431
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,730
难道没有什么值得你留恋吗?
Aren't there things that you miss?

432
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,630
有 当然有
Sure, of course.

433
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
谢谢你
Thank you for this.

434
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,430
我需要陪伴
I needed the company.

435
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,700
我之前自认为不需要 但...
I didn't think I did, but, uh...

436
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,160
结果... 看来我还是需要的
Ah, it turns out that... I do.

437
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,360
谁不需要陪伴呢?
Who doesn't?

438
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,530
想去跳支舞吗?
You want to go dancing?

439
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,200
好啊
Yeah.

440
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,660
夜色真美
It's a beautiful night.

441
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,830
的确
It is.

442
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,100
我觉得好像有人在跟踪我们
I feel like somebody's following us.

443
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,530
- 我去跟他们谈谈  - 别!
- I'll just go and talk to them.  - No!

444
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,230
- Patrick 别去  - 没关系的 我西语说得很溜的
- Patrick, come on.  - No, it's fine. I speak the lingo.

445
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,700
你干嘛要...
Why don't you...

446
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,060
嘿 伙计 出来吧
Hey, guys, come over so I can see you.

447
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,860
天啊
Oh, my god.

448
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,550
你个小杂种走路长点眼睛

449
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,540
少多管闲事!

450
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,760
Patrick 没事吧?
Patrick?

451
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,560
感觉真棒
That feels good.

452
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,560
你真好闻
You smell nice.

453
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,560
你该去看医生
You should see a doctor.

454
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,960
不... 不
No... no.

455
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,030
你可能得了脑震荡
You could have a concussion.

456
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,700
不 我只是... 需要休息
Nah, I just... just need to rest.

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,960
我昨晚喝得很醉
I was very, uh, drunk last night.

458
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
没错
Yes.

459
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,500
发生什么了?
What happened?

460
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,230

463
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,660
你感觉怎么样了?
How are you feeling?

464
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,430
喝了这个好多了
Better now, after this.

465
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,960
你茶泡得真好
You make good tea.

466
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,400
谢谢
Thank you.

467
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,360
我今早收到一条短信

476
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,100

477
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,860
再见...
Anyway...

478
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,460
Hugo啊!
Hugo!

479
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,030
Alfredo呢?
Alfredo?

480
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,660
怎么回事?
What happened?

481
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,080
Otero来过

482
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,490
他喝得烂醉

483
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,190
这狗叫个不停

484
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,400
砰
Pow.

485
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,340
你打算怎么办?

486
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,680
没什么可办的

487
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,460
你又能怎么办呢?

488
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,510
等我这儿忙完了...

489
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,100
就给你煎些蛋去

490
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,530
嘿
Hey.

491
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,900
嗨
Hi.

492
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,630
我就觉得在这能找到你
I was hoping I'd find you here.

493
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,960
我想给你一样东西
I wanted to give you something.

494
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,630
太谢谢了
Oh, thank you.

495
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,330
不 是该我谢你... 跟我共进晚餐什么的
No, thank you... for dinner and everything.

496
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,500
- 我...  - 你说得对
- I...  - You're right.

497
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,130
受人理解是一件无人珍视的美事
Being understood is an underrated pleasure.

498
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,760
我把我家里电话留给你...
Let me give you my home phone number...

499
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,260
说不定哪天你就回国了
in case you ever make it back to the States.

500
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,160
世事难料嘛
You never know.

501
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,100
你可能会想打给我
You might wanna give me a call.

502
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,430
有可能吧
I might.

503
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,160
再见了 Patrick
Goodbye, Patrick.

504
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,500
希望你的决定为你带来好运
Good luck with your decision.

505
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,160
还有件事...
You know, one thing...

506
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,630
回去未必意味着回到过去
going back doesn't have to mean going backwards.

507
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,360
回去照样可以放下过去
It can mean moving on.

508
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,060
我是Abbott
Abbott.

509
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,560
嘿 探员
Hey, G-man.

510
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,200
我准备好回家了
I'm ready to come home.

511
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,360
哇 真是好消息
Wow. That is good news.

512
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,160
但是要按我的条款来 明白吗?
But on my terms. Is that clear?

513
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,860
我一回美国
And when we get back to the U.S.,

514
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,930
就要和管事的人见面
I want a meeting with whatever powers-that-be

515
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,830
明确这些是正式条款
to make clear that those are the terms.

516
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,630
我肯定我们可以做到
I'm sure we can work out something like that.

517
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,500
- 我要Lisbon也在场  - 为什么?
- And I want Lisbon there.  - Why?

518
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,560
要是Lisbon不在 我就不答应
Lisbon's there, or I don't do it.

519
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,360
而且如果你嘴上说她会去结果她不在的话
And if you say she's gonna be there and she's not,

520
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,060
我会向你的上司明确在所有联邦调查局探员中
I will make it clear to your bosses that I will work

521
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,330
我唯独不与你合作
with any FBI agent except you.

522
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,400
那样你便是
You'll have done all the work to get me,

523
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
赔了夫人又折兵
and get nothing for it.

524
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,030
就这样说定了吧?
Do we have an understanding?

525
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,630
你想我们什么时候去接你?
What time do you want us to pick you up?

526
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,230
我会通知你们的
I'll let you know.

527
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,230
我现在得先办点事情
I got something I got to do first.

528
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,030
- Franklin?  - Patrick? 最近如何啊?
- Franklin?  - Patrick? How are you?

529
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,260
好 挺好的 我需要你帮忙
Good. I'm very good. Uh, I need your help.

530
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,160
你跟我说过Danny Otero
You said that Danny Otero was buying some heroin

531
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
跟一些越南毒贩购买海洛因
from some Vietnamese dealers.

532
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,400
你不该管Danny Otero的闲事
You should have nothing to do with Danny Otero.

533
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,530
我? 当然不 我都不会接近他
Me? No, of course not. I'm not going anywhere near him.

534
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,630
你知不知道他交易完成了没?
Do you know if he's already made the buy?

535
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,730
没呢 越南人今早刚住进旅馆
No. No, Vietnamese guests only check in this morning.

536
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,260
很好 我需要你帮我查出三件事
Excellent. I need you to find out three things for me.

537
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,230
我什么都查得出
I can find out anything.

538
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,800
第一 交易什么时候进行?
First, when will the deal happen?

539
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,330
第二 他们在哪间房?
Second, what room will they be in?

540
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,400
还有呢?
What else?

541
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,660
呃 对了
Uh, yes.

542
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,500
呃 那些越南人什么时候用餐
Uh, when the Vietnamese will be eating.

543
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,660
没问题 他们从不用正餐 一直待在酒吧
No problem. They never eat. Always in the bar.

544
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,530
很好 Franklin 你棒极了
Excellent, Franklin. You're very good.

545
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,400
非常 非常出色
Very, very good.

546
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,830
多谢
Thank you.

547
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,530
不用找...
No, just...

548
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,100
下午好 抱歉打扰了
Good afternoon. Sorry for the interruption.

549
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,600
呃 我想你们之中有一个会说英语
Uh, I assume one of you speaks English.

550
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,360
我会
I do.

551
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,760
我是Patrick Jane 很高兴认识你
Patrick Jane. Pleased to meet you.

552
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,700
什么意思?
What's this about?

553
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,430
我知道你们是毒贩子 无意冒犯
I know you're drug dealers. I don't judge.

554
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,060
我自己在美国也因杀人被通缉
I'm wanted for homicide myself in the U.S.

555
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,760
我要谈的是我们共同认识的一个人...
What I want to discuss is a mutual acquaintance...

556
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,530
叫Danny Otero
Danny Otero.

557
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,200
他怎么了?
What about him?

558
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,260
我觉得应该提醒你们 他叛变了
Well, I thought I should warn you. He's flipped.

559
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,160
他目前是警方的线人
He's working as an informer to the police.

560
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,900
他和叫Abbott的联邦调查局探员是一伙的
He's teamed up with an FBI agent named Abbott.

561
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,500
你怎么知道的?
How do you know this?

562
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,160
我自己就在另一份协议中
Well, I'm working with Abbott myself

563
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,800
和Abbott是合作关系
on a different deal.

564
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
我就是这么知道Otero的名字的
That's how Otero's name came up.

565
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
如果你们和Danny Otero做生意

566
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
奉劝一句良言...

567
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
小心为妙
you might want to be careful.

568
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,130

572
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,530
我正跟几个朋友
I'm having a little good-bye drink

573
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,930
喝几杯道个别
with some friends.

574
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,860
在门口报上自己的名字
Just identify yourself at the door,

575
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,230
他们就会来叫我了
and they'll come get me.

576
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,660
什么事?
Yes?

577

联邦调查局的Abbott

00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,230

联邦调查局的Abbott
Abbott, FBI.

580
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,400
Patrick Jane没跟你说我要来吗?
Didn't Patrick Jane tell you I was coming?

581
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,130
等一下
One moment.

582
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,830
- 你把我们出卖给警察了?  - 什么?
- Did you sell us to the police?  - What?

583
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,630
你是不是把我们出卖给警察了?
Did you sell us to the police?

584
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,000
没有 没有...
No, no, no...

585
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,060
联邦调查局的人就在外面
The feds are right outside.

586
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,830
你以为你能逃过一劫?
You think you can get away with this?

587
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,260
- 什么乱七八糟的  - 好吧...
- The hell with this.  - All right...

588
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,830
- 我跟你们说 我没...  - 联邦调查局! 不许动! 不许动!
- I'm telling you, I'm not...  - FBI! Don't move! Don't move!

589
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,400
双手抱头
Put your hands on your head.

590
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,630
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

591
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,160
把枪交出来 别磨蹭
Dejo esa. Ahora.

592
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,060
很好
Good job. All right,

593
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,530
现在所有人趴到地上

594
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,430
趴到地上
Down on the ground.

595
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,430
向下
Al suelo.

596
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,330
趴到地上
En el estomago.

597
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,530
嗯?
Huh?

598
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,200
真不错
Ah, that's nice.

599
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,700
非常好
Very nice.

600
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,530
问题只剩下...
The only question is...

601
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,760
Patrick Jane在哪?
where's Patrick Jane?

602
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,330
Abbott 出了什么事?
Abbott, what happened?

603
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,360
是你下的套
You set this up.

604
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,100
是你敲的门
You're the one who knocked on the door.

605
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,730

613
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,660
原版留我这

614
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,030
- 好吧 咱们走  - 等一下
- All right. Let's go.  - Ah, one second.

615
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,620
你个小杂种走路长点眼睛

616
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,130
现在咱们可以出发了
Now we can go.

617
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,060
Jane先生!
Mr. Jane!

德克萨斯州 奥斯丁

619
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,800

Ha!

622

你总是给我惊喜
You never cease to amaze me.

623
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,530
从这里开始他由我接管了
I got him from here, guys.

624
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,200
看来你进了联邦调查局?
So you joined the FBI, huh?

625
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,700
没错
Yeah.

626
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,400
五个月前在匡蒂科结束培训
Finished training at Quantico five months ago.

627
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,000
哇 看看你

628
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,300
祝贺啊
Congratulations.

629
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,760
谢了
Thanks.

630
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,830
好
Yeah.

631
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,460
这边走
It's this way.

632
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,900
好吧
Okay.

633
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,060
你的袜子哪儿去了?
Where are your socks?

634
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,130
呃... 我不知道
Uh... I don't know.

635
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,530
他们是在你后颈植入了芯片吗?
Did they put a chip in your neck?

636
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,930
就我所知没有 问这干什么?
Not that I know of. Why do you ask?

637
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,200
没什么 只是你看起来见到我不是很高兴
Ah, you just don't seem too happy to see me.

638
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,800
见到你我是高兴的
I am happy to see you.

639
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,100
- 我只是希望能换个方式  - 为什么?
- I just wish it was under different circumstances.  - Why is that?

640
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,260
我觉得你和联邦调查局不会合作得很愉快的
I don't think you and the FBI are gonna get along very well.

641
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,860
他们不会真正理解你的做事方式
I don't think they really understand how you operate.

642
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,700
他们了解我之后就不会盯那么紧啦
Ah. They'll loosen up once they get to know me.

643
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,830
嗯
Mm-hmm.

644
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,530
左手边第二扇门

650
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,730
太想你了
Oh, I missed you.

651
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,530
我也很想你
I missed you, too.

652
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,330
怎么回事? 为什么把我叫来?
What's going on, huh? Why am I here?

653
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,330
- 一会儿就知道了 会很棒的  - 什么?
- You'll see. It's gonna be great.  - What?

654
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,960
相信我
Trust me.

655
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,930
好吧 咱们开工
All right, let's get this started.

656
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,860
Jane... 这些都是
Jane... these are the charges

657
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,730
对你的指控...
pending against you...

658
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,800
凶杀 妨碍执法
homicide, obstruction of justice,

659
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,260
加重恐吓 偷窃等等
aggravated assault, grand theft auto, etcetera.

660
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,400
等待你的是20年的徒刑
You're looking at 20 to life.

661
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,960
但如果你同意在联邦调查局
But all of that can go away if you agree

662
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,300
至少担任五年时间的顾问
to serve as a consultant for the FBI

663
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,330
那些指控都会被撤销
for at least five years.

664
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,930
你由我监管
You will be under my supervision,

665
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,560
处于联邦调查局的假释
on federal parole,

666
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,830
随时由我决定是否撤回
which may be revoked at any time at my discretion.

667
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,730
你要是瞎搞 逃跑 只要是任何令我不悦的事情
You screw up, run away, do anything that I don't like,

668
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,900
你立刻就回监狱里去
and you'll be in the jailhouse.

669
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,400
签字 便一言为定
Sign, and we have a deal.

670
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,030
有意思
Interesting.

671
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,900
嗯
Hmm.

672
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,860
你应该意识到
As you're aware,

673
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,860
你已经同意了某些条款
you have already agreed to some terms.

674
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,430
我没同意
I didn't agree to those.

675
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,760
我签字只是表明已阅
I signed indicating that I read them.

676
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,060
- 有什么区别  - 有的 相信我
- Same difference.  - No, it's not, believe me.

677
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,230
首先 没什么假释 我是自由身
Firstly, no parole. I'm a free man.

678
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,230
其次 Lisbon必须和我一起工作
And secondly, Lisbon has to work with me.

679
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,130
- 什么?  - 你不需要Lisbon的
- Hey, hello?  - Well, you won't need Lisbon.

680
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,630
我已经给你派了一个团队
I've already assembled a team to work with you.

681
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,930
- 这点没的商量  - 我有工作 好吗?
- Oh, that's not negotiable.  - I have a job, okay?

682
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,330
不会因为你突发奇想回来
I'm not gonna drop everything

683
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,060
就让我抛下一切
just because you suddenly decided to come back.

684
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,330
咱... 咱们一会儿再谈 还有一些其它条款...
W... we'll talk. There are some other stipulations...

685
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,260
都是小事情 我肯定咱们能谈拢
Easy stuff. I'm sure we can figure them out.

686
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,000
但你这份里没有一条符合 这...
But none of this applies. This...

687
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,030
你好像没太听明白 Jane
I don't think you're hearing me, Jane.

688
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,230
你现在脚踏美国的领土
You are on U.S. soil now,

689
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,460
我代表联邦政府告诉你
I am the federal government, and I am telling you

690
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,700
那不过是张餐巾
that that is a napkin.

691
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,400
这...
This...

692
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,130
才是协议
is the deal.

693
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,260
要么签...
Take it...

694
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,560
要么走
or leave it.

695
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,960
我走
I'll leave it.

696
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,600
真不幸
Oh, that's too bad.

697
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,360
你犯了个错 但...
You made a mistake, but, hey...

698
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,100
Kim 是你?

700

704
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,200
即将被押往拘留所
will be going to a detention suite.

705
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,700
真不幸啊 我来安排
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll make the arrangements.

706
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,560
我不会捣乱的
Oh, yeah, I'm not fussy.

707
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,260
给我找间看得到外面风景的 我就去
If you have one with a view, I'll take it.

708
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,000
要是没有 也无所谓了
If not, uh, whatever,

709
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,400
只要我能泡茶就好
As long as I can make some tea.

710
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,900
她是谁 还有拘留所算怎么回事?
Who is she, and what is a detention suite?

711
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,260
别担心 Lisbon 一切都在掌控之中
Don't worry, Lisbon. It's all under control.
