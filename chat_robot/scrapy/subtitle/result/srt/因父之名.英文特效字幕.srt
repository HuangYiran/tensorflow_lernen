109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We weren't robbing houses!

110
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,288
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Search him. Did you get away all right?

111
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,415
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. Who was it?

112
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those two?

113
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That isn't mine!

114
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,919
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter. It isn't.

115
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,922
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot the bastards! They're always robbing our houses!

116
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you!

117
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,927
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy! Daddy! The IRA has our Gerry.

118
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on, show me.

119
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,435
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, give him that.

120
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,812
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, come on, lads.

121
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,698
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Tommo, get the trousers down.

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,867
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I fucking warned you, Danny.

123
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,619
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't do nothing, honestly.

124
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,454
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give you a break? What's she saying about us?

125
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we supposed to have done?

126
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,706
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what I'm gonna give you.

127
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,749
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, get your trousers down.

128
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,043
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just ran into a house where we had all that gear,

129
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,127
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we've almost lost it.

130
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,379
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was I supposed to know? I was just trying to get away from the Brits.

131
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,048
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause you were stealing lead again, weren't you?

132
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,217
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You were stealing lead.  - Shut up!

133
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,843
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They were shooting at us.  - Shut up.

134
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,595
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the strides down now. Why?

135
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,721
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause you'll get cloth in the wound

136
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,057
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and lose your leg, that's why.

137
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,975
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Peter. Give us a few slaps.

138
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,518
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to shoot us. Fuck's sake.

139
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,895
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking Tarzan.

140
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the balls on him!

141
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,566
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ!

142
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,693
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter! Peter!

143
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,154
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're only young. Give them a chance.

144
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,115
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were just trying to scare some sense into them.

145
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was stealing lead again.

146
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ran through one of our houses and started all this shit.

147
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,621
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you start all this?

148
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,501
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, he'll never survive in this town. Never.

149
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,752
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the last time.

150
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two blow.

151
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Danny, it's the last time.

152
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,923
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same for you, Conlon. Let's go, lads.

153
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,549
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here.

154
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,261
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've never had a thief in our family.

155
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,429
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've had nothing in our family.

156
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you get a job?

157
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,725
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't get jobs. You know we can't get jobs.

158
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,811
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a job.

159
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,981
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want me to work as a bookie's clerk?

160
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,941
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to have some respect.

161
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,901
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, respect for who?

162
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For yourself.

163
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,707
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting you out of here.

164
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,878
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll do no growing up in England, Guiseppe.

165
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,964
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No family life there.

166
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,132
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give over, Ma.

167
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,468
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to miss the boat.

168
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,595
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that? Sausages for your Aunt Annie.

169
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,847
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ, Ma.

170
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,973
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you are, son.

171
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,183
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, let me do that.

172
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I'm ready. Where are you going?

173
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,982
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll walk with you.

174
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,775
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you not trust me to get on the boat?

175
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,404
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure I'll be back when I'm a millionaire, Gran.

176
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,239
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck. God bless.

177
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, son.

178
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheerio, Gerry.

179
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,328
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behave yourself, Ann.

180
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,495
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheerio, Gerry.

181
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,955
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Bridie.

182
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,763
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gone now, forever.

183
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,265
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be surprised if he lasts a month.

184
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,144
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I ever tell you the time I jumped ship?

185
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,314
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jumped overboard about 200 yards out to sea...

186
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Swam back to this godforsaken place.

187
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you swim back?

188
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,658
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a woman involved.

189
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,453
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, aye?

190
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,249
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was when I was healthy, before you were born.

191
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,011
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was her name?

192
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,013
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, you know her name.

193
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,391
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know your own mother's name. Sarah.

194
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,393
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah Maguire she was.

195
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,771
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then she had the misfortune to change it to Conlon.

196
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,245
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boarding all passengers. All second-class passengers boarding now.

197
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:36,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boarding all passengers. All second-class passengers boarding now.

198
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,383
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go and live.

199
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go and live, Son.

200
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,345
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the best advice I can give you.

201
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, honest money goes further.

202
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,108
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honest money goes further.

203
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

204
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

205
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a cliche for every occasion.

206
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,119
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you a call.

207
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Son.

208
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ran up the gangplank to get away from him

209
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,128
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then I suddenly felt bad about it.

210
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided to turn back

211
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,425
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to call him Guiseppe for the first time in my life.

212
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,929
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I turned around, he had already walked away.

213
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just called after him.

214
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,724
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good-bye, Da!

215
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,566
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I met my old schoolmate, Paul Hill.

216
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,488
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little did I know that after meeting him my life would change forever.

217
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,495
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're under arrest.

218
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,416
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck's sake, Gerry!

219
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,878
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still a head case. James Bond, license to kill.

220
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,465
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you, you're a fucking nervous wreck. What's the matter with you?

221
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,217
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad to get outta Belfast.

222
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,682
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where're you going?

223
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,476
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to London. What about you?

224
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,602
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same.

225
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,729
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a drink.

226
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,774
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, I'm skint. I'll let you buy me one.

227
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,872
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once upon a time you dressed so fine

228
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:39,294
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You threw the bums a dime in your prime Didn't you?

229
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,132
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I arrived in London on the 26th of June.

230
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother had given me the address of my Aunt Annie,

231
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,137
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I had an invitation to a hippie commune

232
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from my old friend Paddy Armstrong.

233
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,393
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, Gerry, we've been walking around for hours.

234
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,811
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only that big on the map.

235
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,979
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but it's a map, Gerry.

236
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,356
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London's a big place, you know.

237
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,364
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I was really looking for was free love and dope.

238
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,617
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's this way.

239
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,301
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paddy?

240
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,929
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, what is it?  - We're looking for Paddy.

241

294
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure you won't you stay? I've the bed made up.

295
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,975
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're very kind, but we need a bit of space, Auntie Annie.

296
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,518
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're forming a band and that there.

00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,804
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. There's only one problem.

307
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,141
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't have a phone.

308
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,858
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello, Marian. Any problems?  - No.

312
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,493
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not fair. Their skirts are covering the cracks.

313
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's cheating!

314
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,705
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a referee! He's cheating.

315
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,754
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

316
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,933

319
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wasn't too far away, was it?

320
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,714
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a bomb, Paddy?

321
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,132
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's getting more like home.

322
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,802
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Hold on, hold on.

323
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,555
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guiseppe. Guiseppe. Long-distance call.

324
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,515
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Long-distance call.

325
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:29,895
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead. Hello?

326
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,981
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask him for the money, Gerry. Hey, it's Gerry speaking.

327
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,566
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son. Hi. How are you doing?

328
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,819
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been six weeks, you know, since you've been in touch.

329
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,946
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Sorry about that. I've been a bit busy.

330
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,408
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just your ma's just a bit worried, you know. You still going to mass?

331
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,453
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, every Sunday. Like clockwork. Good.

332
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you working? I have a couple of things going here.

333
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,957
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Ah, good.

334
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And are you safe?

335
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,336
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you mean? From all the bombs.

336
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,632
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, you could just hear them in the distance like, but...

337
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry about that.

338
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,178
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you stuck? How do you mean, Da?

339
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you short of cash?

340
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,098
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, no. No, I'm flush at the moment.

341
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,684
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem. No, I have plenty of money.

342
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. And, Gerry, keep in touch.

343
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,897
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. All right. Bye-bye, Da.

344
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Son. I'll tell your ma...

345
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

346
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry about that.

347
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,908
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've enough for chips.

348
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,246
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, we'd only enough money for two chips.

349
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,625
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right? What?

350
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,669
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's bombs everywhere. People have been hurt.

351
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,004
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There they are. It's the Irish.

352
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bringing all their troubles over here again.

353
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,635
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, it's all right when it happens over in Belfast.

354
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking prick!

355
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,723
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen people killed in front of my fucking eyes!

356
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,976
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stupid fucking prick!

357
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,727
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go home! Fuck you!

358
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't fucking believe this. I'm getting out of here.

359
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,564
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you coming, Paddy?

360
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,774
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you gonna sleep?

361
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,236
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, no problem. We'll sleep in the park or something.

362
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,823
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you soon, sweetheart. Take care.

363
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,575
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind your fucking manners! Prick.

364
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Troops have entered the Ardoyne area of West Belfast

365
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:15,208
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}following the collapse of the provisional IRA cease-fire over the weekend.

366
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm watching it.

367
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,044
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Civilians have been evacuated,

368
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,297
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and there are reports of casualties in many areas.

369
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,424
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both sides are blaming each other...

370
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,634
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'll take care of it.

371
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,305
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. 8:00 tonight.

372
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No warning.

373
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,319
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my place. Youse are sitting there too long.

374
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,324
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CB, Charlie Burke. That's me.

375
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,494
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I carved my initials with this penknife.

376
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,873
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem, Charlie. No problem. Whatever you say.

377
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,293
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Closing the park. Park closing now.

378
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,419
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy with the feet there, Charlie.

379
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,795
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a big bench, you know, Charlie?

380
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,839
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's room for three of us here.

381
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,092
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're Irish too, aren't you?

382
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come over here when I was about your age.

383
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,767
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you ever think of going home, Charlie?

384
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,393
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah, I should.

385
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,605
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing for me over there now.

386
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,026
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Closing the park!

387
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,154
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you... Could you lend us a few shillings?

388
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,781
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was gonna ask you the same.

389
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,157
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

390
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,374
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry, we've no money left. It's all I have.

391
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,503
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, now, I wouldn't like to take all your money.

392
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,379
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem. Catch you again, Charlie.

393
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,423
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on. It's not even 8:00 yet.

394
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, all right.

395
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,773
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must've just said good night to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.

396
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, all we were concerned about

397
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was where we were gonna sleep that night.

398
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,612
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd no money in our pockets.

399
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:12,158
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford even if we'd known where it was.

400
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,662
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No fucking way I'm going back to Belfast.

401
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you that.

402
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,836
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, blondie. Hey, sexy.

403
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,337
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You dropped something.

404
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,005
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back off, Paddy.

405
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,882
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's outta your league.

406
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,551
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

407
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,602
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's her fucking keys. I'm going in.

408
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,274
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should give 'em back, Gerry. Put 'em through the letter box.

409
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,191
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the keys back in the letter box, Gerry.

410
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,456
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ, how much money is there?

411
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,129
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get seven hundred pounds from the prostitute.

412
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,174
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did feel a little bit guilty about that.

413
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We spent that night in a hotel.

414
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,432
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next day we went and bought the same clothes, the same trousers,

415
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,976
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}same jackets, even the same shoes.

416
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:06,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They seek him here They seek him there

417
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His clothes are loud

418
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,152
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But never square

419
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,491
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, mister, has your coat got fleas?

420
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

421
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,544
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when he does his little rounds

422
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Round the boutiques of London Town...

423
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,934
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are those two gorgeous women in the kitchen?

424
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,227
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry ?

425
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,106
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you miss me, Bridie? Look at Gerry.

426
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,024
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a hippie!

427
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,526
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, look at the money!

428
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,027
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want it? Oh, my God!

429
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,195
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want some treats?

430
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you wanna be in my gang?

431
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,491
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Gerry, I wanna be in your gang. I wanna be in your gang.

432
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here. Take it easy.

433
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,623
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steady. Hey, calm it down. Just calm it down.

434
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,542
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my money! It's mine!

435
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,294
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's my money. Calm it down. Stop it.

436
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,503
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my money! Stop that!

437
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave it to me! Stop that!

438
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,159
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop that!

439
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,806
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they were always talking about the troubles, were they?

440
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,475
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Especially Paul Hill.

441
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,396
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was always talking about Belfast, the IRA, all that stuff.

442
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,234
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, all I'm saying is this.

443
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,238
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had a lot of money, and Conlon went back to Belfast.

444
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,907
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come along, into the car. What the fuck is going on?

445
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,495
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a bloody disgrace, them shooting you.

446
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. Did it hurt you, Danny?

447
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,832
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't too bad.

448
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,209
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bullet bounced off the kneecap and come out the other side.

449
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,711
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five people are dead

450
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,256
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and 75 seriously injured

00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,343
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as a result of the IRA's no-warning bomb attack on the Guildford pub.

452
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,179
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Parliament has passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows terrorist

454
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,394
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven days. Geez.

455
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,606
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the same here. Seven days. No difference.

456
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,942
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... around London and arrested 19 suspects.

457
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,695
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry, there's your shoes.

458
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,656
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our reporter spoke to Commander Robert

459
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dixon of the antiterrorist squad about those arrests.

460
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,452
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't pretend people won't be inconvenienced.

461
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,579
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of them may not deserve it.

462
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,665
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we shall use these powers as selectively as possible.

463
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,551
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up out of bed, you dirty, murdering bastard!

464
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hands above your head!

465
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,681
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what the fuck youse are looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

466
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,727
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry, your coat. He's done nothing.

467
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,145
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inside, sir. He's not political.

468
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,356
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a right to speak to my son.

469
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,649
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep calm, Gerry. Da! Da!

470
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,942
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep calm, Gerry.

471
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,488
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back in. Get back inside.

472
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,368
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right. It's all right.

473
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,135
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going?

474
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,219
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll find out soon enough.

475
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,515
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd he get this money?

476
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,891
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

477
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,688
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have no right to take him to England.

478
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,401
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow down a bit.

479
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:33,456
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I don't have a fucking clue what this is about, so I don't.

480
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,058
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've done nothing wrong.

481
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,773
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've done nothing wrong.

482
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,357
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When can I go back to Belfast?

483
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next time you see Belfast, they'll be flying day trips to the moon.

484
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,404
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always wanted to be an astronaut.

485
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,376
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you charging me with?

486
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,837
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

487
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:22,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

488
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:26,008
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can hold you for seven days and seven nights without charging you.

489
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,636
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since when was I a fucking terrorist?

490
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:29,818
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you part of that, Gerry?

491
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,642
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that. You proud of that?

492
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,729
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that. Why are you showing me these people?

493
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,568
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No marks! Don't mark him! Don't mark him!

494
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,861
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you fucking proud of that, huh?

495
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,823
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that! Look at that young, pretty girl there!

496
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now look at her!

497
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,785
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're out of your fucking minds!

498
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,579
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you? You're out of your fucking minds!

499
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,333
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children know there's something terrible going on.

500
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're not making it any easier.

501
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,753
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't the strength for this.

502
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,424
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he killed innocent people, I haven't the strength for the child.

503
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,801
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I know that child. I carried that child.

504
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,012
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if you're not gonna believe in him, I will.

505
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,722
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, you think he's innocent?

506
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,558
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When your son walked through that door looking like a bloody circus clown,

507
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,059
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do you think he had murder in his eyes?

508
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,146
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy birthday to you

509
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a surprise.

510
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,567
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy birthday to you... Shut up. No, shut up, shut up!

511
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,041
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When will Daddy be back?

512
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,543
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll be back in a couple of days.

513
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,838
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did they put Gerry in jail?

514
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,465
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a mistake.

515
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,552
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on my way over to bring him back home.

516
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,222
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you getting narky again? Eh?

517
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,974
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we touching a sore spot?

518
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name all the places you stayed while you were in England, Gerry.

519
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,563
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you about 100 times already.

520
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,523
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then tell us again!

521
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,613
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stayed at the squat most of the time.

522
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,114
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was a couple of nights at my Auntie Annie's...

523
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one night at the hotel after I robbed the money.

524
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,094
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Male. Late 40s.

525
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,596
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who taught you how to make the bomb, Gerry?

526
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,432
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never made any bombs.

527
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Annie make the bomb, Gerry?

528
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,772
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

529
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,109
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Annie Marian?

530
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,695
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Annie who?

531
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,862
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Annie Maguire!

532
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Aunt Annie?

533
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,952
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb, and Mother Teresa planted it.

534
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,579
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was Carole Richardson's part in this operation?

535
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you Marian?

536
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

537
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,797
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you Marian?

538
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She had nothing to do with it.

539
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,224
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This man comes into my house. He puts a gun to my head.

540
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,309
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says I done Guildford.

541
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I left Belfast to get away from people like him.

542
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,858
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me what you want me to sign.

543
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an alibi for that night.

544
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,075
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you showing me these for?

545
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry told us you did it.

546
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,999
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then he's a fucking liar.

547
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,376
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Armstrong drove the car.

548
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was the woman in the back?

549
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,966
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

550
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you were in the Ford Cortina.

551
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you were in the red Ford Cortina.

552
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll get used to your methods, and then he'll clam up.

553
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,144
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you I was...

554
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you I was in the Cortina. I told you it was a taxi.

555
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,691
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. The taxi was a Toyota Corolla.

556
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,234
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When can I ring home?

557
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,862
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's start again. Who's Marian?

558
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,947
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it someone Irish? Gerry?

559
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you getting narky again? Touching a sore spot?

560
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was her name?

561
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,495
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing to do with what?

562
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing to do with what, Gerry?

563
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,955
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to me.

564
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,377
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two little girls asked me, "Why was Daddy blown up? "

565
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,923
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who taught you how to make the bomb, Gerry?

566
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,135
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry, talk to me.

567
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,391
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No?

568
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,102
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll do what he's told.

569
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,356
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him. He's a lying bastard.

570
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a right fucking comedian. Aren't you, Gerry?

571
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Marian?

572
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,402
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what...

573
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,154
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting fucking bored with this.

574
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,781
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is Marian? I don't know.

575
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,391
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna keep on asking you the question until you give me a fucking answer!

576
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,537
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is Marian? I don't know!

577
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you fucking do!

578
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,915
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bollocks! Who is Marian?

579
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,963
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know who Marian is.

580
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,184
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you the man in charge? Yes, I am.

581
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For fuck's sake, tell 'em to stop hurting me.

582
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God...

583
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,446
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know where I was at the time of the bombings.

584
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,537
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was with a madman called Charlie Burke.

585
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,332
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you any other alibis?

586
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,127
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have told youse before...

587
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,297
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was with Paul Hill most of the day.

588
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell Gerry Conlon like you said you would.

589
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,608
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's this?

590
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:16,692
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry Conlon.

591
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you anything to say to him?

592
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,494
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've cleared my conscience.

593
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,331
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I advise you to do the same.

594
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,555
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's your statement.

595
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do this.

596
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,313
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't fucking do this!

597
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do it.

598
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please believe me.

599
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing to me?

600
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They wouldn't hold him if he hadn't done something.

601
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,084
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry is no angel.

602
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,377
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that.

603
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,337
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He needs a strong hand.

604
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't bloody move!

605
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,259
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your hands up! Put your hands on your head!

606
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all under arrest.

607
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,848
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child! Put your hands up!

608
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Hill leading us up the garden path?

609
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,572
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

610
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can make him confess.

611
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,455
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you have a word in his ear?

612
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:57,001
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're from the same town. He'll understand you.

613
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you have the bomber?

614
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our job is to stop the bombing.

615
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna shoot your da.

616
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,406
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say to me?

617
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Bridie'll have no daddy.

618
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,122
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna shoot Guiseppe.

619
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's threatening to shoot my da!

620
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's threatening to kill my da!

621
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,099
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him! Look at him!

622
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,351
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him! He's a madman!

623
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,353
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're hallucinating, son.

624
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,897
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody's gonna harm your father.

625
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,565
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

626
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,109
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him back. Get him back.

627
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,404
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He threatened to kill my da.

628
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,281
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody's gonna kill your father.

629
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,033
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mad bastard!

630
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,701
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

631
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,746
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not gonna harm your father.

632
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,708
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let it all out.

633
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let it all out, all that hatred.

634
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hate us, don't you? Hmm?

635
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hate us enough to bomb and maim.

636
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the trouble. You let it all out. Come on.

637
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't hate you.

638
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,518
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you do.

639
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,396
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see it in your face. I can see all that hatred.

640
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,816
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why don't you just let it off your chest, huh,

641
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,402
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before it starts to mess up with your mind?

642
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,451
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the fucking statement.

643
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,289
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For fuck's sake, give me the statement.

644
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,042
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me a fucking pen.

645
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, that's my fucking name there.

646
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can write what you like.

647
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,559
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, nice and easy. Come on.

648
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,187
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul! Paul! What's going on?

649
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,523
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry! They stuck a fucking gun in my mouth!

650
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,775
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I told 'em a lot of bullshit!

651
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,527
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you give 'em my fucking name?

652
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:11,862
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry!

653
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fucking mad!

654
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:18,911
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be laughed out of fucking court!

655
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The four of us were split up.

656
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,499
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was taken to South London Remand Center.

657
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,919
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can check the dates, Gareth.

658
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill that fucker!

659
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill that fucker!

660
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking son of an Irish cow!

661
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,399
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick that Irish fucking ass!

662
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:50,734
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that?

663
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,818
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delousing.

664
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,403
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have fucking lice. I don't want that.

665
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,489
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have no choice, mate.

666
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,203
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Conlon. Go see the room, shall we?

667
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,001
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Mr. Conlon.

668
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,676
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got your son.

669
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let's go, shall we?

670
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,722
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da!

671
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,559
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da! Da! Da! Da!

672
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,602
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that you, Son?

673
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,687
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da, here!

674
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,855
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you?

675
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,029
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hurt my father. Don't hurt my father.

676
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,239
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be all right, Son. It'll be all right.

677
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,282
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't kill him!

678
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da!

679
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,579
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, move along.

680
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,498
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move along. Come on, you.

681
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,749
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you!

682
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:48,959
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, you!

683
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,586
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up!

684
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,713
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the floor!

685
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,601
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you doing here, Da?

686
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,855
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come over to your Aunt Annie's to get you a lawyer.

687
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,565
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They arrested everybody in the house.

688
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,233
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

689
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What for, fuck's sake?

690
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,695
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conspiracy to murder.

691
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,823
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Oh, fuck's sake, no. Jesus Christ!

692
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you do it? Did you do it, Son?

693
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,916
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I did not!

694
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,716
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I fucking didn't do it, fuck's sake!

695
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,561
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you looking at me like that?

696
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,104
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

697
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you looking at me like that?

698
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,361
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what?

699
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,906
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you always follow me? Huh?

700
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you always follow me when I do something wrong?

701
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,121
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you follow me when I do something right?

702
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,539
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

703
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,125
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? What am I talking about? I'm talking about the medal.

704
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What medal?

705
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What fucking medal? What fucking medal?

706
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only fucking medal that was ever in our house.

707
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,636
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The medal I won at football.

708
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you sat on the sidelines shouting instructions,

709
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,057
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like you could only see what I was doing...

710
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,726
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You couldn't even fucking play football

711
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,479
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you could only see what I was doing wrong.

712
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,523
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could never do anything good enough for you.

713
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,526
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after the game, you came up to me and you said...

714
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said, "Gerry, did you foul the ball? "

715
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,364
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I walked away from you, do you remember now?

716
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,157
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I walked away from you into the dressing room.

717
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You followed me in there and you said again, "Gerry, did you foul the ball? "

718
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,662
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all the other fathers were in there.

719
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,748
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were laughing at you, calling you "Poor Guiseppe. "

720
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,252
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I ran out, and I hid, and I wrote your name on the ground,

721
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,129
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your stupid Guiseppe fucking name,

722
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,507
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wrote it in the dirt, and I fucking pissed on it!

723
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pissed on it...

724
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,096
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I did foul the ball.

725
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:10,016
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did it matter? We won. For once in our lives, we won.

726
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,393
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ruined that medal for me!

727
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,353
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took it to the pawn, and they laughed at me.

728
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,896
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.

729
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is shock.

730
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:20,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's when I started to rob, to prove that I was no good.

731
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,528
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delayed shock.

732
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,779
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delayed shock. Never mind delayed shock.

733
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been like this since I was seven.

734
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,702
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember Mummy said to me, "Don't upset Guiseppe. He's not well. "

735
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.

736
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:31,705
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we'd tiptoe around the house.

737
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,124
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like this, tiptoeing around the house.

738
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,959
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Not well, you know. He's not well. "

739
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I got Holy Communion. I thought I was eating you alive.

740
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, is it my fault you weren't well?

741
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,176
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you have to be sick all your life, Guiseppe?

742
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you have to be sick all your life for?

743
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When that mad bastard out there threatened to shoot you, I was happy.

744
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,225
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God. Honest to God, I was happy.

745
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was delighted! You know why?

746
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,978
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because finally it was all over.

747
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,147
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was over! You see?

748
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,567
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I knew I was bad.

749
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,445
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew I was bad then, you see, so I started to cry.

750
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,822
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I started to tell lies, the same fucking lies

751
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:09,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been telling all my gobshite fucking life.

752
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,583
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what that mean? It means words don't mean nothing.

753
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,667
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop this.

754
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,045
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? Only this time, I got everyone into trouble.

755
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,838
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it doesn't matter, does it? 'Cause I'm no good anyhow.

756
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

757
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,176
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep away from me. You've been following me all your fucking life,

758
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,345
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now here you are in jail. You doing this deliberately?

759
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:29,763
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Stop it. Are you doing it deliberately?

760
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,681
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you doing it deliberately?

761
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,308
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You call that a fucking dig, huh?

762
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,351
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you call that a fucking dig?

763
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit me harder. Hit me like...

764

765

766

771
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,965
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my child. It's okay.

772
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,721
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not your fault, Son, all right?

773
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's gonna be all right.

774

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. All right, Son.

775

00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:38,915
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody else was allowed to touch.

779
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}IRA, closed visits. No contact.

780
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,181
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you doing this to us?

781
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,728
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have your father locked up in prison for murder.

782
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speak up, please.

783
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,107
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not my fault, Ma.

784
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,401
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy, Sarah.

785
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,699
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God, I've done nothing wrong.

786
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,869
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you sign a confession, Son?

787
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did it to protect me, love.

788
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,416
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a good son there and that's all you need to know.

789
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,544
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't sign anything yourself, did you, Guiseppe?

790
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,547
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing I said was I wanted to see you.

791
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,176
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, they've no statement nor evidence against me.

792
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be out and home soon.

793
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,555
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, I'm only visiting here myself.

794
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,225
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be able to help out Gerry while I'm in here.

795
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,938
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danny's dead, Gerry.

796
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

797
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,363
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They found his body on waste ground.

798
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,658
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The IRA said he was an incurable thief.

799
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sent a mass card from the family.

800
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,504
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one'll not go to school since you've been away.

801
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you go to school for your mummy.

802
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,216
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Daddy.

803
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,427
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, when will you be home?

804
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've pressed your Sunday suits for the trial.

805
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,268
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make sure and look your best now, Son.

806
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,565
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But is there nitro or was there not nitro?

807
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,277
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, there are traces of nitro.

808
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,405
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But are they all positive?

809
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,116
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yes, on six of them.

810
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,201
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who'd we miss?

811
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,203
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The aunt, Aggie... Annie.

812
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,957
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But her rubber glove showed a faint trace.

813
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the children? The children?

814
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,129
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Positive.

815
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The results may not be good enough for court.

816
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your word will be good enough for the court.

817
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,807
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

818
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,522
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill the bastards! Kill 'em!

819
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,155
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot the bastards!

820
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,463
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call number one.

821
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,218
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go. Jesus, it's a nightmare, Guiseppe.

822
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stay calm, be on your best behavior,

823
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,765
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and this'll be behind us soon.

824
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, come on.

825
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,977
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say a wee prayer.

826
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will be all right.

827
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,827
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All rise.

828
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir Michael Hagerty will present the case on behalf of the Crown.

829
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:34,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are two series of charges here, ladies and gentlemen.

830
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,778
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The four defendants in front

831
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are charged with 11 counts in relation to the explosion of the Guildford pub

832
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,828
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the murders of five people.

833
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,248
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Crown will show that these were the bombers.

834
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,875
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The seven defendants behind

835
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,002
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are charged with the possession of explosives.

836
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,796
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not charged with murder.

837
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,173
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Crown's case against them is

838
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,884
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they are a support network for the bombers,

839
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,928
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and as such should be considered totally independent.

840
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,888
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Control yourself. Pay attention.

841
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:08,434
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My first witness is Inspector Robert Dixon.

842
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,605
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I give shall be the truth,

843
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,567
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"the whole truth and nothing but the truth. "

844
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,073
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inspector, why do you believe these four are the bombers?

845
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,996
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First Hill, then Conlon, Armstrong, Richardson,

846
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}confessed to the bombing.

847
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,292
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are the IRA's ASU.

848
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,961
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you explain ASUs for us?

849
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,754
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Active Service Unit.

850
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,214
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are the elite of the IRA,

851
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,091
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}those who carry out the bombings and the shootings.

852
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:45,221
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very often they are combat veterans with previous experience of

853
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,347
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}shooting at soldiers and planting explosives.

854
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,267
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the others, Annie Maguire and her family?

855
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,728
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are the IRA's support network.

856
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,479
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They store...

857
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,482
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their families, friends, they store the weapons and explosives

858
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,903
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they provide what we call safe houses.

859
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,614
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Inspector.

860
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,367
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inspector, these people were arrested

861
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,829
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}two days after the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced.

862
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,831
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's correct.

863
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you explain, please, the powers that this gives to the police?

864
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:19,964
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It permits us to hold suspected terrorists for a period of up to seven days.

865
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,592
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite extraordinary powers in a democracy.

866
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,385
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite difficult, I would've thought, for the police

867
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,013
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to resist the temptation to deal forcibly with people.

868
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,097
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Objection.

869
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People whom they suspect of the biggest bombing campaign

870
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,061
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on British mainland since the Second World War.

871
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,771
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Objection. My Lord, I really must...

872
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get to the point!

873
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this bombing campaign

874
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,945
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}struck deep into the British people's sense of security.

875
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,615
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people looked to you, Inspector, to find those responsible.

876
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,741
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

877
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,619
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must have been under the most intense pressure.

878
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my job.

879
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,916
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, all of the defendants claim...

880
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,044
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Including young Patrick Maguire, aged just 14.

881
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrick, would you stand up, please?

882
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,051
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. All of the defendants claim that they were

883
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:09,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}subjected to physical and mental abuse while under police custody.

884
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,559
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were never harmed in any way.

885
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fucking lying! They beat the shite out of us!

886
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:20,942
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence! Stop this noise!

887
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,656
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence! Just be quiet.

888
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,576
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence in the court!

889
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,373
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Conlon says

890
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,419
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you pulled him by the hair and squeezed his testicles.

891
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never even spoke to Mr. Conlon.

892
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,257
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.

893
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence!

894
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:50,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Hill says the police sat astride him and put a gun in his mouth.

895
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,017
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was no pressure of any kind.

896
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,186
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can go and fuck yourself, you lying fucking bastard!

897
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,272
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Order! Order in court!

898
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,941
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inspector, in the case of the four main defendants,

899
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,068
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have no corroborating evidence of any kind.

900
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,447
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have the confessions of four obvious terrorists. What more do you want?

901
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:11,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, nitroglycerine is a highly toxic substance.

902
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,036
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's when the substance to be tested...

903
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,414
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After a few weeks, we were bored out of our minds.

904
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just messed around and that there.

905
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,128
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must've been desperate for evidence.

906
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They produced my Auntie Annie's

907
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}washing-up gloves like a rabbit out of a hat at one point.

908
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,093
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it was my turn to take the stand.

909
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:32,513
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Conlon, did you bomb Guildford?

910
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,974
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I didn't.

911
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,561
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police claim that you were in Guildford on the night of the bombing.

912
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you tell us where you were?

913
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,357
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was in a park in London at that time.

914
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,692
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who with?

915
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:46,402
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With Paul Hill sitting there.

916
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,947
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You met somebody else that night, about 8:00 p.m.

917
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,201
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.

918
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,619
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who is he?

919
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:57,163
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was just like a, you know,

920
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,956
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like a fellow, a homeless guy that we met in the park.

921
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,292
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you remember this man so clearly?

922
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,921
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember thinking that if I didn't get out of London fast,

923
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,339
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was gonna end up like him.

924
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,759
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told this to the police? Aye.

925
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,968
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did they say?

926
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,512
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said he didn't exist.

927
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,308
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Conlon, why did you confess to the Guildford bombing?

928
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They beat me

929
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,564
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then they threatened to kill my father.

930
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you repeat that please?

931
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,277
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They terrorized me for seven days.

932
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after that, they threatened to kill my father.

933
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,449
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have fucking signed anything after that.

934
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse my language.

935
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,994
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

936
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:43,042
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You expect this jury to believe that decorated police officers

937
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,462
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would risk their career and their reputation

938
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,673
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by threatening your father?

939
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,467
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't expect them to believe it by the time you finish with them,

940
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,386
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it happens to be truth, you know.

941
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,721
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're an honest man, aren't you, Mr. Conlon?

942
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,224
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like to think so.

943
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,562
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've told us you remember this Charlie Burke very well.

944
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:04,564
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye.

945
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,985
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember telling the police anything else about that night?

946
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,696
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me refresh your memory.

947
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told Inspector Dixon

948
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,783
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you had committed a robbery on that night.

949
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,661
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now do you remember?

950
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye.

951
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,375
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who did you rob?

952
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,295
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robbed a hooker.

953
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,005
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You robbed a prostitute?

954
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,214
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye.

955
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,675
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we are expected to believe a man

956
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,844
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who claims he stole from a prostitute

957
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,513
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before we would believe

958
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:40,474
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}10 police officers who stood here on oath and called you a liar?

959
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the truth.

960
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,228
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I mean...

961
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,732
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm bound to say I don't find you very convincing.

962
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,817
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Mr. Conlon.

963
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you tell me that you stole from that woman?

964
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,955
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should've called me. I would've sent the money.

965
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,465
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna be a thief and a liar all your life?

966
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:17,929
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Standing up in that witness box, making faces to your mates.

967
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,237
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least you told the truth in there. That'll stand you.

968
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:43,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you not going to eat that sausage?

969
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,498
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

970
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,752
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They put a gun in my mouth

971
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,297
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and made me confess to a murder I didn't commit.

972
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,884
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I said I did the big bombing

973
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,471
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and named anybody I knew who was not in the IRA.

974
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,848
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not in the IRA?

975
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,517
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Definitely not in the IRA.

976
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:05,977
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

977
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,813
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know why.

978
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I just wanted to show how ridiculous it all was.

979
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,408
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inspector, the defendant Conlon presented an alibi.

980
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,159
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One Charlie Burke.

981
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir, that name did appear in Mr. Conlon's statement.

982
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,289
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We investigated it.

983
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We couldn't find any trace of such a person.

984
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then there was this question of the robbery of a prostitute.

985
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No robberies were reported in that area that night.

986
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:38,509
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the start of this trial, I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

987
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Subsequently, I was deeply shocked

988
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,805
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when a member of the legal profession came to me

989
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,224
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and asked me if I was now going to wash my hand.

990
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,645
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my long legal career, I cannot remember a case

991
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,772
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where emotions have been so charged.

992
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It falls to me now to appeal to you the members of the jury,

993
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,864
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not to get caught up in this tide of mass hysteria.

994
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:05,578
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inspector Dixon admits there are scores of inconsistencies in the confessions.

995
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,243
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My clients contend

996
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:09,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they were forced to confess through brutality and intimidation.

997
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,755
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, they may be foolish, petty thieves,

998
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,758
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even drug abusers.

999
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:24,722
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they are not the ruthless bombers who have terrorized Britain for months.

1000
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should find these young people not guilty.

1001
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,105
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bollocks! Okay, let's go.

1002
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your fucking hands off me! Move it!

1003
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,572
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hands off. Hands off! Hands off!

1004
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen,

1005
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:51,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like my learned colleague in the defense,

1006
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,002
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would caution you not to be swayed by your emotions.

1007
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,923
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The four people you see in the front

1008
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:03,719
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are one of the most cunning and cruel criminal conspiracies

1009
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,892
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, here are the facts of this case...

1010
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inspector Dixon, a decorated officer of great expertise,

1011
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:19,819
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}acting on reliable information and good detective work, arrested Paul Hill.

1012
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:24,407
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who, guilt-ridden by the shame of his crime, confessed.

1013
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:29,412
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That confession led the police to the ringleader, Conlon,

1014
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and his terrorist family.

1015
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:36,544
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His aunt, Annie Maguire, the experienced bomb maker

1016
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,672
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who wore rubber gloves when handling explosives

1017
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,383
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the kitchen of her home in Harlesden.

1018
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,927
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She even allowed her children to handle explosives.

1019
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,597
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vincent, aged 16, Patrick, 14,

1020
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,059
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who did not... Could not know any better.

1021
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guiseppe Conlon, her brother-in-law,

1022
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:58,399
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the courier who arrived with more explosives.

1023
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:02,486
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Armstrong and his dupe, Richardson, who carried the bomb.

1024
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, these are the people who in a panic had to dispose of the nitroglycerine.

1025
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,037
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is what sealed their fate.

1026
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do we know this?

1027
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the truth was on their hands.

1028
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:24,216
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a story written in the blood of their victims.

1029
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:28,305
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have seen some of those who survived their callous

1030
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}disregard for human life.

1031
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:35,144
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is now your duty to protect society from them.

1032
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,607
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am confident that that is what you will do.

1033
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,561
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you reached a verdict?

1034
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,606
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, we have, My Lord.

1035
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,944
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you find the defendants?

1036
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,153
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guilty as charged.

1037
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:31,617
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang the Irish bastards!

1038
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Order! Silence!

1039
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,167
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}String 'em up!

1040
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,802
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerard Patrick Conlon.

1041
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand up.

1042
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,811
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel it is my duty to wonder aloud

1043
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:02,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why you were not charged with treason to the Crown,

1044
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:07,152
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a charge that carries a penalty of death by hanging.

1045
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:14,493
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A sentence I would have had no difficulty in passing in this case.

1046
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,122
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sentence you to life imprisonment

1047
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:24,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I instruct that you shall serve A minimum of 30 years.

1048
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,756
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take him down.

1049
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,677
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Son.

1050
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:40,811
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me.

1051
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,698
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Michael Hill.

1052
01:05:55,327 --> 01:06:00,789
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my view, your crime is such that life shall mean life.

1053
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:06,128
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Annie Maguire, I recommend you serve 14 years!

1054
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,963
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have I done, for Christ's sake?

1055
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take her down!

1056
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guiseppe Conlon, 12 years.

1057
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:13,469

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1163
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,762
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

1164
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,392
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you to take it whether I live or die.

1165
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,398
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

1166
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. I'll do nothing to annoy you in your grave.

1167
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,494
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now are you happy?

1168
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a promise?

1169
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:29,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye.

1170
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:32,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

1171
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,348
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry, man, check out your friend.

1172
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He look like the real thing.

1173
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:53,191
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1174
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,163
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. All right.

1175
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,419
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's have a talk.

1176
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to eat in the cells.

1177
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,136
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See ya later.

1178
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,931
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry. Gerry, come on.

1179
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Morning, paddy.

1180
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,507
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

1181
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:02,761
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry

1182
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,808
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1183
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,061
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, man, Gerry!

1184
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:25,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one, this one, this one, 14 days solitary! Lock up!

1185
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,619
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lock up!

1186
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,789
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll be all right. He'll be back in a couple of days.

1187
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,385
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm worried about Bridie.

1188
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,097
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1189
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,975
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's dyed her hair blonde.

1190
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,813
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she's only young.

1191
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's wearing a dog collar.

1192
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,413
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a fella chained to it. He's got one on, too.

1193
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,292
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

1194
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as she's happy.

1195
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,016
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lunch break.

1196
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Gerry, man! That's right!

1197
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,898
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry's a bad boy!

1198
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the Englishman on their heavy, heavy manners.

1199
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:45,989
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir. Go on, boy. Kick out them clods, yes?

1200
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,076
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Joe McAndrew. He has something important to tell you.

1201
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,494
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Mr. Conlon.

1202
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:55,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm watching you.

1203
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,761
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

1204
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:13,224
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one who planted the Guildford bomb, Mr. Conlon.

1205
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you tell the police that?

1206
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:19,898
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I did.

1207
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,692
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we haven't heard a thing.

1208
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,736
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you just wait and see what he has to say, Da?

1209
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,113
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

1210
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:31,075
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told them. They know... They know the truth.

1211
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,913
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't afford to face it.

1212
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,666
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a war. You're one if its innocent victims.

1213
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,835
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry for your trouble.

1214
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,795
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be sorry for us.

1215
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be sorry for the people you killed.

1216
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:50,094
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a military target, a soldiers' pub.

1217
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:54,641
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were innocent people, God's children.

1218
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:59,312
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'll do all I can to help you while you're in here.

1219
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,772
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't need your help.

1220
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,984
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us alone.

1221
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,071
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you say.

1222
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:13,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about that.

1223
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,748
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that all about? You mind your fucking manners.

1224
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,084
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Manners to him?

1225
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want any part of him, or his ways.

1226
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least he stands up for himself. At least he fights back,

1227
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:25,964
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is more than you ever did in your life.

1228
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,382
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

1229
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,133
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember Lydon Hill? Huh?

1230
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You used to ride me up on the crossbar of your bike up Lydon Hill.

1231
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,264
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then one day you couldn't make it to the top,

1232
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,933
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I hopped off the crossbar, and I looked back,

1233
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your face was all red.

1234
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,728
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember that? Aye.

1235
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was working in the paint shed done that to you.

1236
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,402
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1237
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:51,114
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the fumes from working in the paint shed done that to you.

1238
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,658
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind jumping off the ferry and swimming back to Mummy.

1239
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,577
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the one job a Catholic can get,

1240
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1241
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,455
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on outside.

1242
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Play with your newfound friend.

1243
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,919
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, all I'm saying is that you've been a victim all your life.

1244
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:06,671
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about time you started to fight back.

1245
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,381
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of my sight. I'm going.

1246
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,971
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the only way it'll work. We have no alternative.

1247
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,323
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what are you doing?

1248
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

1249
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,952
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't do it.

1250
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:39,037
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They all did it.

1251
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going back to Belfast.

1252
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,051
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After the fight, nobody stopped us

1253
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,178
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}going out in the yard to exercise.

1254
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,888
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I felt brilliant.

1255
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,473
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joe explained things to me.

1256
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,643
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He explained how the Brits never left anywhere without a fight.

1257
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,188
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How they had to be beaten out of every country they ever occupied.

1258
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:08,483
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How this prison was just an extension of their system.

1259
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,152
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calling for work on the threes.

1260
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,656
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had to confront the chief prison officer, Barker.

1261
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,823
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Smalls.

1262
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,743
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But to do that, we had to take care of Ronnie Smalls.

1263
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I have a word about 54, Halsley Road?

1264
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,876
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a walk.

1265
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anything happens to me or Gerry

1266
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,474
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or any other Irish prisoner,

1267
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll have 54, Halsley Road blown to smithereens

1268
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,606
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with your family in it.

1269
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:53,277
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Threaten my family and I'll cut your fucking head off.

1270
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,574
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't make threats.

1271
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,618
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just carry out orders.

1272
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,662
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to hurt your family.

1273
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:11,504
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your trouble is, Joe, you want to rule the fucking world.

1274
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:14,549
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paddy's all right.

1275
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:29,188
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soon, we were all one happy family.

1276
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,356
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again!

1277
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,775
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even Kojak was ready to forgive.

1278
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Live and let live.

1279
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,737
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barker began to panic.

1280
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,614
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He told us to take our socks out of the window.

1281
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,242
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thought we were signaling to other prisoners.

1282
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:44,287
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not signaling. We're drying our socks out.

1283
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:46,122
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the socks out of the window. Who says?

1284
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:47,623
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Barker.

1285
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,001
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was all the excuse Joe needed.

1286
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,335
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us two minutes.

1287
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:53,963
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, up and away we went. Are you with me?

1288
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,381
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he up to now?

1289
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,596
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All prison officers to vacate the wing.

1290
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,098
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All officers vacate the wing!

1291
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:11,981
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This'll damage the whole campaign.

1292
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,484
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you do it your way, and we'll do it ours, all right?

1293
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can read our demands.

1294
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go back to your cells.

1295
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,031
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blankets!

1296
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,617
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For God's sake, put a stop to this.

1297
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,535
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're weakening my position, Guiseppe.

1298
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will end in violence. Good.

1299
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:27,747
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's good about it?

1300
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:28,915
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all they understand.

1301
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,961
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barker refused to negotiate.

1302
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,255
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But with the screws gone, we'd a brief taste of freedom.

1303
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out Ronnie!

1304
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:41,052
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Him swallow half Africa.

1305
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give him about an hour.

1306
01:25:51,254 --> 01:25:53,523
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We found out later our protest got on TV.

1307
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:56,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's when the riot squad was ordered in.

1308
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were singled out as the ringleaders.

1309
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:15,294
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

1310
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:42,947
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just signed your own death warrant, Barker.

1311
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:48,911
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you happy now?

1312
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,334
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you arrived, Gareth.

1313
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:59,714
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the first time I saw you, under a raining shower of sparks.

1314
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:03,676
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the first time I'd seen a woman in five years, other than my mother.

1315
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,012
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But to me, you were a lawyer first.

1316
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,305
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I hated lawyers.

1317
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:08,723
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And do you have a new isolation room?

1318
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,727
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bert, Andrew.

1319
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:16,147
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bailey, Benjamin. McAndrew, Joseph.

1320
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,649
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. Can you... I can't hear. Conlon, Gerard.

1321
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:20,693
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}O'Brien, John.

1322
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,739
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lynch, Bernard. Crisp, Quincy.

1323
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lyon, Richard. Burns, Delrow.

1324
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,702
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Conlon?

1325
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. Guiseppe Conlon.

1326
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,123
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's on the third floor.

1327
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,835
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has difficulty getting down the stairs.

1328
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,881
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'll just have to go up and see him then.

1329
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The delegation has seen enough. Right-o. Sorry.

1330
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:47,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I won't be a minute. I'll just... Is that all right? Sorry.

1331
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,307
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll meet you outside, okay? Sorry.

1332
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,273
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, I can't...

1333
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:00,524
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pulmonary thrombosis.

1334
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,943
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're getting medication...

1335
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's getting proper medication?

1336
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:04,278
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you? Yes?

1337
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,701
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son?

1338
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry!

1339
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,414
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's... Is it Gerry?

1340
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:16,749
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Gerry. Uh-huh.

1341
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,168
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's had a spot of bother with lawyers in the past.

1342
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,716
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's all yours. Fifteen minutes.

1343
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,843
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Sit down.

1344
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:36,811
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1345
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,167
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you giving my father false hope?

1346
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry?

1347
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:05,256
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been up and down these stairs every couple of weeks to see you.

1348
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,133
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He hasn't even seen my mother in six months.

1349
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,386
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I hear you're getting on very well with her, by the way.

1350
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,596
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. She's a very brave woman.

1351
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,515
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, you don't know the half of it.

1352
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,103
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fucking stairs are killing him.

1353
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:21,939
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not the stairs that are killing your father, Gerry.

1354
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,774
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, what is it, then?

1355
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,151
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your lack of faith.

1356
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:28,195
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lack of faith? Faith in what?

1357
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:29,989
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In yourself.

1358
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,825
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I have faith in myself.

1359
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,955
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry Conlon, lifer, 30-year sentence.

1360
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:39,999
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know how to survive it. No problem.

1361
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:42,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At what price?

1362
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,379
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll pay the fucking price. Don't you worry about it.

1363
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:48,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The price for what?

1364
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're very good at the English, aren't you?

1365
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:56,515
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, I don't understand your language.

1366
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Justice. Mercy. Clemency.

1367
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,399
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I literally don't understand what those words mean.

1368
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,903
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, I'd like to put in an application to get all my teeth extracted.

1369
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,738
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that way I could put my fist in my mouth

1370
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,449
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and never speak another word of fuckin' English so long as I live...

1371
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,659
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you see what I'm saying, Miss Peirce? Mrs. Peirce, is it?

1372
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:18,204
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you trying to impress me?

01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't give my father false hope, all right?

1375
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry!

1376
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,174
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you've got to help him!

1377
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:35,596
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In prison, you pray for anything to break the monotony.

1378
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,349
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A snowstorm is like a present from God.

1379
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

1380
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,778
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prison officers are not to be hit!

1381
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,364
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you lot, you've asked for it.

1382
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:58,911
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After the riot, my father's health deteriorated badly.

1383
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,456
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He couldn't make it down the stairs to enjoy the snow.

1384
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:05,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I waved up to him, but he was looking at something else.

1385
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My da always saw the good in people.

1386
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,059
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He recognized it in you the minute he saw you, Gareth.

1387
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,811
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guv, guv, where you going?

1388
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's me letters? Guv'nor!

1389
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,694
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1390
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:39,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you've been mentioned in Congress, Guiseppe.

1391
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:40,536
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

1392
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,627
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you come by that name?

1393
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,173
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? An Italian ice cream maker.

1394
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:55,718
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had a shop on the corner of the street where I was born.

1395
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:00,681
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother fell in love with the name.

1396
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:01,932
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were they...

1397
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,019
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know. What?

1398
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:08,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lovers. Who?

1399
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,024
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother and the Italian ice cream maker?

1400
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,985
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, God.

1401
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:15,487
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, no. No, they were not.

1402
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:18,741
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she just liked the name.

1403
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,036
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it made my life hell.

1404
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:25,289
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the other children laughing at you.

1405
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have any kids yourself?

1406
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's talking to Barker now.

1407
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:35,758
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it, Joe. He can talk to whoever he fucking likes.

1408
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,803
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two.

1409
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,349
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flown the nest now.

1410
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:02,493
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whether Barker was responsible or not

1411
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,829
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for bringing in the riot squad, Joe never forgave him.

1412
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,333
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joe was still at war.

1413
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,752
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to him, Barker was the enemy.

1414
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,964
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number?

1415
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,924
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The name is McAndrew.

1416
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:21,053
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out... Get out of the way, out of the light.

1417
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:23,764
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of the light.

1418
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:24,807
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number?

1419
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:26,308
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name's Gerry Conlon.

1420
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,521

1421
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,439
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're 136.

1422
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:40,489
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's someone sitting there.

1423
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,077
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move when you're told.

1424

1426
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:25,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's good.

01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a hair in the fucking projector!

1431
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:37,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, get the fucking hair out the projector, will you?

1432
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,883
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Get it out!

1433
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:42,384
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it out!

1434
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:47,723

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get there, Pop. Quiet.

1436
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:58,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say a fucking thing. You're blocking.

1437
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:15,042
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew that Santino was gonna have to go through all this.

1438

1440
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I never... I never wanted this for you.

1441
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,141
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oi, you!

01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:50,053
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you not look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you?

1455
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:55,726
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I know how to look at people without blinking as well.

1456
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:01,982
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In all my godforsaken life, I've never known

1457
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what it was like to want to kill somebody until now.

1458
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:10,616
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a brave man, Joe, a brave man.

1459

1469
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,539
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Joe was sent to another prison.

1470

01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:08,173
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I was back walking in circles again.

1474

1476
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:44,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to help you out with the campaign, Da...

1477
01:38:46,546 --> 01:38:48,755
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that's all right with you.

1478
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:50,716
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mean it?

1479
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,426
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye.

1480
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:54,928
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great.

1481
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:57,723
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Gerry, what I need from you is the whole story,

1482
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,726
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your whole story, in as much detail as you can remember.

1483
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:03,186
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every detail you can think of, and I need you to write it down.

1484
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,188
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really important.

1485
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,196
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't do this.

1486
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,242
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't write this, Da.

1487
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,119
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could your son not give you a hand?

1488
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:22,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah. He's up in his cell writing away.

1489
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:28,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1490
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,844
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tape recorder.

1491
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,221
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're... You're a good talker.

1492
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk.

1493
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:43,477
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The strange thing is...

1494
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The strange thing is sometimes I think he's a little jealous

1495
01:39:47,065 --> 01:39:49,733
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of me taking over the campaign and that there.

1496
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,569
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going up and down the stairs to meet you.

1497
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's something I never thought about Guiseppe,

1498
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,241
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that he could be jealous.

1499
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:03,163
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyhow, the main thing is to get the case reopened

1500
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,417
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I don't know how long he can survive in here.

1501
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:25,977
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm tired of this.

1502
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. We have to do this. Come on.

1503
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,065
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You behave yourself.

1504
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your head down.

1505
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:46,164
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder what you were doing under the towel.

1506
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:47,833
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one day when you and Ma were out,

1507
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:49,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a big bowl of boiling water,

1508
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:53,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whacked a big drop of Vicks and then put the towel over my head.

1509
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:54,798
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I sat there trying to figure out what it was all about

1510
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,134
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause nothing was happening.

1511
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,177
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I figured you must've been drinking it. Do you remember that?

1512
01:40:59,262 --> 01:41:01,138
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I stuck my tongue in it. Do you remember that?

1513
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,226
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could I forget?

1514
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:10,147
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your tongue swelled up like a football.

1515
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,275
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had to rush you to the hospital.

1516
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,569
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First time you'd stopped talking in your life.

1517
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:19,823
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us that.

1518
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:24,119
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1519
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:33,336
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was I always bad, was I?

1520
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:36,089
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not always.

1521
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't deserve to spend the rest of my life in here, do I?

1522
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:42,929
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All they've done is block out the light.

1523
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,473
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't block out the light in here.

1524
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:46,558
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen.

1525
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,351
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every night...

1526
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:50,645
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take your mother's hand in mine.

1527
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We go out the front door, into Cyprus Street,

1528
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:58,069
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}down to Falls Road, up the Antrim Road

1529
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,364
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to Cave Hill.

1530
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:03,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We look back down

1531
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,788
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on poor, troubled Belfast.

1532
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:15,921
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been doing that every night for five years now.

1533
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:20,175
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As if I never left your mother.

1534
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,687
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I remember most about my childhood is,

1535
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:34,439
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}holding your hand.

1536
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,192
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wee hand in your big hand.

1537
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:40,153
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the smell of tobacco. I remember that...

1538
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could smell the tobacco off the palm of your hand.

1539
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:50,831
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I want to feel happy, I try to remember the smell of tobacco.

1540
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold my hand.

1541
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:58,547
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the fuck...

1542
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:01,716
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, don't go sentimental on me now.

1543
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:06,346
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be upset, Da. Look, I'll hold your hand if you like.

1544
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:10,433
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to die.

1545
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:13,645
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be saying that.

1546
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared.

1547
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,359
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've no reason to be scared.

1548
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:20,652
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have nothing to be scared about.

1549
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:25,282
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you be comforting me when I can see the truth staring me in the face.

1550
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:28,785
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared I'm gonna die here among strangers.

1551
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not fucking dying, all right.

1552
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:35,125
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I not say a thing without you fucking contradicting me?

1553
01:43:36,002 --> 01:43:40,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared to leave your mother behind.

1554
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:45,677
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you are not going to die, all right, Da?

1555
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:51,766
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if you do, sure I can look after Ma all right.

1556
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,103
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'd leave Sarah in your care?

1557
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:58,273
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

1558
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:02,319
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't the maturity to take care of yourself, let alone your mother.

1559
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:11,828
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't much time between appointments, Mrs. Peirce.

1560
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:14,581
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I help you? Thank you.

1561
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:17,959
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the solicitor for the Conlons, Chief Inspector.

1562
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:21,671
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guiseppe Conlon is critically ill, as you may know.

1563
01:44:22,048 --> 01:44:24,424
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've petitioned before the court for his compassionate parole.

1564
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,509
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want your clearance.

1565
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:28,929
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll be difficult, Mrs. Peirce.

1566
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,973
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These people have committed horrific crimes.

1567
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:34,768
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Society demands that they serve their time.

1568
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:38,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they didn't do it, Chief Inspector.

1569
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:39,856
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says who?

1570
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say the real bombers.

1571
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:44,986
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They told you they did it, Mr. Dixon.

1572
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,822
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry Conlon told me he did it, Mrs. Peirce.

1573
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:49,824
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These people are liars.

1574
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:52,953
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're liars for a cause. That's the worst kind.

1575
01:44:53,371 --> 01:44:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's dying. Guiseppe's dying.

1576
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:58,291
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of people are dying. It's a dirty war.

1577
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,923
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'll see what I can do.

1578
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:07,092
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this your family, Mr. Dixon?

1579
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,178

1684
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:15,788
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've moved me to a Scottish jail to break up my campaign.

1685
01:53:15,873 --> 01:53:17,123
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put him in solitary.

1686
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:18,332
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a peaceful protest.

1687
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:19,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not observing prison rules.

1688
01:53:19,918 --> 01:53:21,335
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll teach you manners.

1689
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:23,129
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better men than you have tried that already.

1690
01:53:23,464 --> 01:53:25,798
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Honor, I have not seen my client for two months.

1691
01:53:25,883 --> 01:53:27,091
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been moved to Scotland,

1692
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:29,969
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which has seriously impeded my investigation into his case,

1693
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:33,222
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm filing this motion to gain proper access...

1694
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:35,308
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Free the Four! Free the Four!

1695
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:36,392
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Free the Four!

1696
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:52,658
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks a lot. Good day.

1697
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:54,619
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1698
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:15,223
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. Could you copy that for me, please?

1699
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:17,433
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1700
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:31,322
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want my mother to be happy.

1701
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,951
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like her to know

1702
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:38,996
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Guiseppe talked about her every day of his life.

1703
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,626
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He missed her terribly.

1704
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:50,633
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's strange to be in a cell without him.

1705
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:56,681
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't seem to get his face out of my mind.

1706
01:54:56,765 --> 01:54:58,975
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everywhere I look, I see him.

1707
01:55:05,941 --> 01:55:09,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strange what time does when you're in prison.

1708
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:14,991
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, you can be staring at the wall.

1709
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drip, drip, drip.

1710
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,415
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes an eternity.

1711
01:55:22,499 --> 01:55:25,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you blink, and three years have gone by.

1712
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what I'm trying to...

1713
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:36,012
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what the fuck I'm trying to say.

1714
01:55:38,682 --> 01:55:41,684
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't forget what they did to my family.

1715
01:55:43,395 --> 01:55:45,187
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just can't forget.

1716
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:20,222
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry ! Gerry !

1717
01:56:34,112 --> 01:56:35,363
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Morning.

1718
01:56:36,615 --> 01:56:37,907
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Jenkins?

1719
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,241
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He telephoned in sick.

1720
01:56:39,326 --> 01:56:41,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid you're going to have to come back tomorrow.

1721
01:56:41,411 --> 01:56:43,245
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, I can't. I've got a case in court tomorrow.

1722
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:44,413
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's just too much to get through.

1723
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:45,873
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I can't help you.

1724
01:56:46,124 --> 01:56:47,792
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Look, I've got a court order.

1725
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:50,336
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saw what Mr. Jenkins did. You just bring me the files.

1726
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,838
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take the notes and give them straight back to you. Please.

1727
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:54,006
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What name is it?  - Conlon

1728
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:58,761
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Thanks. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1729
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What name was that again?

1730
01:57:06,645 --> 01:57:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conlon.

1731
01:57:08,188 --> 01:57:10,231
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we've got two Conlon boxes.

1732
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:14,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it Guiseppe Conlon or Gerard Conlon?

1733
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,363
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerard.

1734
01:57:25,163 --> 01:57:26,956
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's the start of them.

1735
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,312
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck 'em!

1736
01:57:51,356 --> 01:57:52,815
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck 'em!

1737
01:57:53,316 --> 01:57:55,234
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good news, Gerry.

1738
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:58,487
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're talking about a piece of evidence

1739
01:57:59,239 --> 01:58:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that says they knew all along,

1740
01:58:01,074 --> 01:58:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they let my father die in prison?

1741
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:05,661
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you mind telling me what's good about that, Gareth?

1742
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:07,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get them in court.

1743
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:09,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We'll get them in court? "

1744
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:10,458
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For fuck's sake, will you catch yourself?

1745
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:12,376
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've kept us in prison for 15 years.

1746
01:58:12,461 --> 01:58:13,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can keep us in for another 15.

1747
01:58:13,879 --> 01:58:15,671
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the fuckin' government, Gareth!

1748
01:58:16,173 --> 01:58:18,758
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the fuckin' government! What are they gonna say?

1749
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:21,427
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We're sorry about that? "

1750
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:25,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Made a wee bit of a mistake there, but you can be on your way now? "

1751
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they gonna say? "Sorry we killed your da"?

1752
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sorry we fucked your fucking life to hell"?

1753
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:31,562
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they going to say?

1754
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:36,901
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry...

1755
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm not putting my mother through hell again.

1756
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,375
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you afraid of court?

1757
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,961
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I just don't wanna be humiliated again.

1758
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:18,859
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear by Almighty God

1759
01:59:18,944 --> 01:59:22,321
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth

1760
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:24,448
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and nothing but the truth.

1761
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:35,251
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dixon, do you know these young people

1762
01:59:36,628 --> 01:59:38,754
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}known as the Guildford Four?

1763
01:59:40,966 --> 01:59:42,132
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I do.

1764
01:59:43,218 --> 01:59:45,261
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how long they have spent in jail?

1765
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:49,098
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifteen years, I believe.

1766
01:59:50,642 --> 01:59:52,309
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know Annie Maguire

1767
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:56,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who served her 14 years without remission?

1768
01:59:57,607 --> 02:00:00,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know her son Vincent who served five years?

1769
02:00:00,652 --> 02:00:02,194
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know her son Patrick who served four?

1770
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:04,446
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know her husband, Paddy Maguire,

1771
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:06,782
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who served 12 years?

02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:11,287
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carole Richardson was 17 when she went to jail, Mr. Dixon.

1773
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:13,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now she is 32.

1774

02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:18,586
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, what is the point of this?

1776
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:21,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, come to the point, Mrs. Peirce.

1777
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:30,723
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know who this is, Mr. Dixon?

02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,687
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't.

1779
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:39,982
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then would you be so kind

1780
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:42,401
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as to read this statement that you took from him

1781
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:45,529
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the 3rd of November, 1974?

1782
02:00:45,614 --> 02:00:48,741
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A statement, My Lord, which vindicates all of these people,

1783
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:49,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all these innocent people.

1784
02:00:50,035 --> 02:00:51,744
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, I need to see a copy of this statement.

1785
02:00:51,828 --> 02:00:55,831
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either that man or his superior or his superior's superior

1786
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:58,334
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ordered that these people be used as scapegoats

02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:00,377
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by a nation that was baying for blood... Mrs. Peirce!

1788
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:01,462
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord!

1789
02:01:01,546 --> 02:01:05,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In return for the innocent blood spilled on the streets of Guildford!

1790
02:01:05,133 --> 02:01:06,425
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by God, you've got your blood, Mr. Dixon.

1791
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:08,052
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Peirce is making a political speech.

1792
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:09,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is outrageous. You got the blood of Guiseppe Conlon,

1793
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:11,847
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you got the lifeblood of Carole Richardson,

1794
02:01:11,932 --> 02:01:14,892
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you got 15 years of blood and sweat and pain from my client

1795
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:17,978
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whose only crime was that he was Irish. Silence in court!

1796
02:01:18,063 --> 02:01:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he was foolish, and he was in the wrong place at the wrong time!

1797
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:24,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Peirce, I will have you removed from the court.

1798
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,326
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one of your colleagues, My Lord,

1799
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:34,536
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who sat where you sit now said, and I quote,

1800
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:37,706
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"It is a pity you were not charged with treason to the Crown,

1801
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:41,377
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"a charge that carries a penalty of death by hanging.

1802
02:01:41,586 --> 02:01:45,047
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"A sentence I would have no difficulty in passing in this case. "

1803
02:01:45,382 --> 02:01:48,842
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Peirce, I am trying to read this document.

1804
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:51,512
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will not tell you again to be silent

1805
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:54,932
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or you will be removed from the court.

1806
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, this document

1807
02:02:39,644 --> 02:02:42,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}brings the entire British legal system into disrepute.

1808
02:02:42,814 --> 02:02:45,232
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, this is new evidence.

1809
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:47,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is shocking new evidence.

1810
02:02:47,777 --> 02:02:48,986
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, this evidence

1811
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:52,281
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was not submitted at the trial that is under appeal.

1812
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:55,951
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, I believe, is the point that Mrs. Peirce is trying to make.

1813
02:02:56,161 --> 02:02:57,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Proceed, Mrs. Peirce.

1814
02:02:57,412 --> 02:02:58,495
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, I demand a recess.

1815
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:01,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There will be no demands made in my court.

1816
02:03:03,001 --> 02:03:04,376
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand back.

1817
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:10,799
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, this alibi for Gerry Conlon

1818
02:03:11,885 --> 02:03:13,343
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was taken by Mr. Dixon

1819
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:16,221
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one month after Gerry Conlon was arrested.

1820
02:03:17,057 --> 02:03:20,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This note was attached to it when I found it in police files.

1821
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:22,978
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It reads, "Not to be shown to the defense. "

1822
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:33,405
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have one question to ask you, Mr. Dixon.

1823
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:37,454
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon, who was charged with the murder

1824
02:03:37,498 --> 02:03:42,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of five innocent people, kept from the defense?

1825
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:51,924
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us an answer! Answer the question!

1826
02:03:52,759 --> 02:03:54,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence!

1827
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:55,761
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about time!

1828
02:03:55,845 --> 02:03:57,554
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Order in the court!

1829
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:02,351
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, I would like to approach the bench.

1830
02:04:02,435 --> 02:04:03,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is most irregular.

1831
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:06,271
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I am aware of that, My Lord.

1832
02:04:07,357 --> 02:04:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very well.

1833
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,251
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dixon, you may stand down.

1834
02:04:27,335 --> 02:04:28,961
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! No! My Lord!

1835
02:04:29,045 --> 02:04:31,255
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Lord, this is the man who should be under arrest!

1836
02:04:31,381 --> 02:04:33,549
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be silent, Mrs. Peirce!

1837
02:04:33,925 --> 02:04:35,425
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This court is now in recess.

1838
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:36,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guards, get ready.

1839
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:38,778
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, don't try and make me

1840
02:04:41,932 --> 02:04:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the fall guy for the whole British legal establishment.

1841
02:04:46,354 --> 02:04:49,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, if I accept this mercy deal...

1842
02:04:49,524 --> 02:04:50,774
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've a flippin' cheek, offering me mercy.

1843
02:04:50,859 --> 02:04:52,401
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, they should be begging for mercy themselves.

1844
02:04:53,403 --> 02:04:54,528
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ready, Mr. Conlon? Aye.

1845
02:04:54,612 --> 02:04:55,988
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know the difference between right and wrong.

1846
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:57,281
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. The truth has to come out.

1847
02:04:57,365 --> 02:04:58,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They may not want to hear it in the court,

1848
02:04:58,575 --> 02:05:00,325
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but there's people outside who'll listen.

1849
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just think about it, will you?

1850
02:05:01,744 --> 02:05:02,828
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just think about it.

1851
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:05,581
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. Give us three of them.

1852
02:05:21,389 --> 02:05:22,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence!

1853

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Guiseppe Conlon?

1860
02:05:48,374 --> 02:05:50,709
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Honor, he was an innocent man!

1861
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:55,714
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Conlon, that's not a good idea. Use the back...

02:05:55,798 --> 02:05:57,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For security reasons.
