00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,600
{\a10}{\fs18}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H000000&}{\bord1}婚礼前27小时

3
00:00:00,493 --> 00:00:02,556
距离巴尼和罗宾的婚礼还剩两天的时候
Two days before Barney and Robin's wedding,

4
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:04,123
他们的牧师挂了
their reverend passed away,

5
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,159
他们启动了寻找牧师大行动
and the search was on for a replacement.

6
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:08,328
哦天啊 又是那个
Oh, boy, it's the creepy,

7
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,963
黑暗教堂的肿泡眼牧师
bug-eyed minister from that culty church

8
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:13,433
老在追问我们是不是"至死纯洁"
who kept asking us if we're "Pure enough to die."

9
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:15,235
目前就数他最好了 我还是接了吧
He's our best lead. I should get this.

10
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,854
詹姆斯 除非你能找到个牧师
James, unless you have a minister,

11
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,639
不然我现在没空听你瞎扯
I don't want to hear it.

12
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,407
你说的牧师是 这种的吗
You mean, like this one?

13
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:23,159
几年前
A few years back,

14
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:27,080
巴尼他哥詹姆斯终于见到了他失散多年的父亲 山姆
Barney's brother James finally met his long-lost father, Sam,

15
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,082
他竟然还是一位牧师
who turned out to be a reverend.

16
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:32,318
现在我宣布 你们的小命有救了
I now pronounce your asses saved.

17
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,440
吉布斯牧师还不是唯一一个在那天出场的重量级人物
Reverend Gibbs wouldn't be the only VIP arrival that day.

18
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:38,925
爸爸
Dad!

19
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:41,845
巴尼 哦 真不敢相信你都要结婚了
Barney. Oh, I can't believe you're getting married.

20
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:44,097
你都长这么大了
You've grown up so fast.

21
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:48,334
不过话说回来 是我错过了你人生中的30年来着
Then again, I did miss about 30 years of your life.

22
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,770
我在登记处还给你们留了两份礼物哦
Did I mention we got you two things from your registry?

23
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,439
对了 一会儿能请你俩喝一杯吗
Hey, can we buy you guys a drink in a bit?

24
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,774
好啊 一会儿吧台见
Sure. We'll meet you at the bar.

25
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,463
哦 哇 快看
Oh. Whoa. Look.

26
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,065
我爸妈很多年没见过面了
My dad hasn't seen my mom in years,

27
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,283
自从我爸抛弃了我妈就再也没见过面了
not since he bailed on her.

28
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:05,485
哦天 资深离异家庭的小孩告诉你
Oh, man, take it from a fellow child of divorce,

29
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,237
这下可要乱套了
this could get real messy.

30
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,539
洛蕾塔 很高兴见到你
Loretta, good to see you.

31
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,741
我也是 杰瑞
You, too, Jerry.

32
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,878
喔
Wow.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,963
谢天谢地 没什么狗血剧情上演
Yeah. Thank God, no drama.

34
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:18,965
他们深爱着彼此啊
They're in love!

35
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:22,669
我爸爸妈妈要复合啦
My mom and dad are getting back together again!

36
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,204

我准备把这个给罗宾来着
I want to give this to Robin.

43
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,967
她是格雷茨基的脑残粉
Gretzky's her hero.

44
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,969
有时候她会在床上喊他的名字 我已经习惯了
She says his name sometimes in bed. I've accepted it.

45
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,254
在晚餐排练之前 你能不能 呃 帮我藏一下这个 
Can you, uh, hide it for me till the rehearsal dinner?

46
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:48,856
伴郎出马你放心
The best man is on it.

47
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,091
太好了 现在要去让爸爸和妈妈复合啦
Great. Now I'm gonna go get my mom and dad back together.

48
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,477
他们完全坠入爱河了 是吧 超赞是不是
They're totally in love. I know. It's amazing.

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,594
今夜做梦都会笑
I'm walking on air.

50
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:55,813
我的家终于重新完整啦
My family's gonna be whole again!

51
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,816
我们要不要阻止他一下呢
Should we stop him or something?

52
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,952
伴郎我还是藏好格雷茨基吧
The best man is staying on the Gretzky thing.

53
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:06,157
* 我要大步前行五百里 *
 Well, I would walk 500 miles and 

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,410
* 还要继续跋涉五百多 *
I would walk 500 more

55
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:14,632
* 只为成就一次千里行 *
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles 

56
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,619
* 最后倒在你家门口 *
Then falls down at your door.

57
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:19,971
哈
Ha!

58
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,172
你说对了
You're right.

59
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,590
这破玩意还真心是洗脑神曲啊
That crap grows on you.

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,891
再来一遍不
Again?

61
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,926
来吧
Proclaim it!

62
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,926
{\a6}这首歌的原唱是Proclaimers乐队

63
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,063
嘿 我刚才正躺在
Hey. So there I am,

64
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,098
天井下面那些脏兮兮湿乎乎的沙子上
lying in the wet, filthy sand under the patio,

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,185
思考人生的时候 我爸就撞见我妈了
just minding my own business, when my dad bumps into my mom,

66
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,937
然后他说 听着哦
and he says-- get this--

67
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,773
他跟她说"天气转好了 是吧"
he says to her, "Weather's improving, huh?"

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,078
简直了 他俩直接开干好了 对吧
It's like, why don't you just do it already? Huh?

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,747
巴尼 我知道你一直梦想有个完整的家
Barney, I know you've always dreamed of a reunited family,

70
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,866
但是... 杰瑞已经结婚了啊
but... Jerry's married.

71
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,335
那又怎样 婚姻不就是张纸吗 屁用都没有
So what? Marriage is just a meaningless piece of paper.

72
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,486
艾玛我真是个幸运的女孩
I'm a lucky gal.

73

亲爱的 这事儿没戏的
Sweetie, this just isn't gonna happen.

74
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,990
现在 我要你跟我保证
Now, please promise me

75
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:58,158
你没有在实施任何疯狂的计划
you haven't already put some crazy scheme in motion.

76
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:03,497
我没有在实施 任何 疯狂的计划
I haven't put some crazy scheme in motion.

77
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,833

Why did you pause?

78
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:10,137
我没停啊
I didn't pause.

79
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,689
你停一会儿是啥意思
Why did you pause?!

80
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,618

巴尼发短信让我火速去找他
Barney texted me to meet him ASAP,

84
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,187
可是楼梯湿滑

87
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:32,660
他也给我发了一样的短信

巴尼 杰瑞已经有老婆了
Barney, Jerry has a wife.

89
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,218

偷偷跑去玩滑伞 然后现在让我去会合
snuck off to go parasailing, and he wants me to join him?

92
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,724
是的
Yes.

93
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,596
准备好享受这个
Who is ready to rock it

94
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,149
苏格兰二重唱模式
Scottish-identical- twin-brothers style?

95
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,149
{\a6}500miles的原唱 Proclaimers 二人乐队组合

* 我一定将在你身边醒过来 *
I'm gonna be the man who ends up next to you...

99
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,743
才发现啊 但愿他们不是对同一个妞唱的吧
Oh, man, I hope they're not singing to the same girl.

100
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,695
或者是对彼此唱的
Or to each other.

101

你能让我和你妈妈复合
you can get your mother and me back together?

我就是想以一场
I'm just trying to keep you refreshed

123
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,213
意外而又浮夸的电梯故障桥段 让你们重获新生
through this unexpected and flukish elevator malfunction!

124
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,616

脱光光 然后把湿衣服送上来
Just disrobe and send up those wet clothes.

我是说 格雷茨基的照片
I mean, the Gretzky photo!

133
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,606
有个混蛋溜进我的房间
Some bastard snuck into my room

134
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:27,525
把我的墨水全洒在巴尼让我保管的
and spilled ink all over the Gretzky photo

135
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,909
格雷茨基的照片上了
I was holding for Barney.

136
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,578
大侦探莫斯比 重出江湖
Detective Mosby is on the case.

137
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,997
-哦 天啊 太可怕了  -我知道
-Oh, God, that's horrible. -I know.

138
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,148
那是给罗宾的礼物
It was a gift for Robin.

139
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,783
我是说
No, I mean,

140
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,669
哦天啊 太可怕了 大侦探莫斯比又来祸害人了
"Oh, God, that's horrible. Detective Mosby's the worst."

141
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,154
嗯 大侦探莫斯比
Mm, Detective Mosby is

142
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,872
破案时狂拽酷炫吊炸天
the case-crackingest private dick on the scene.

143
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,375
真的吗 比如那个都折腾八年了
Really? Like that case from eight years ago

144
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,093
都始终没破的案子 你怎么说
you still haven't cracked?

145
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:47,795
{\a6}就在上周

146
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,795
还是到此为止吧
I'm callin' it.

147
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,500
妈的
Damn it!

148
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,385
我最伟大的失败啊
My greatest failure.

149
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,020
真相只有一个
I will solve this case.

150
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,521
把你给我那张大头照的时候
Now, there were three people nearby

151
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,190
只有三个人在附近
when Barney gave me that head shot:

152
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,610
功夫坏小子的比利•扎布卡
Karate Kid bad boy Billy Zabka,

153
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,013
贼眉鼠眼的服务员
a shifty-eyed bellhop,

154
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,348
还有罗宾的表兄 来自魁北克的
and Robin's cousin Claude from Quebec

155
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,317
颈椎犯病的克劳德
with the neck trouble.

156
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,687
对啊 毕竟你觉得这些鬼扯的阴谋论比
Right, 'cause an elaborate conspiracy is much more likely

157
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,041
你把照片放在没盖盖子的墨水瓶旁边更有可能了
than you leaving the photo next to an open ink bottle.

158
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,194
-多谢总结  -你连挖苦都侦测不到
-Thank you! -You can't even detect sarcasm!

159
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:22,463
你干嘛不试着弄好照片啊
Why don't you just try to fix the photo?

160
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,714
你就没有消字灵吗
Don't you have ink remover?

161
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,999
我当然有消字灵了
Of course I have ink remover.

162
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,867
我又不是那种邋遢朋克书法家
I'm not one of those sloppy, punk calligraphers

163
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,386
光说不练假把式的那种
who's in it for glory over craft.

164
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,304
我们得解决掉
No, we got to solve this!

165
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,839
现在问题就是
Now, the question is,

166
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,892
这三个犯罪嫌疑人中 谁最有理由陷害我
which of those three suspects had the most cause to frame me?

167
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,213
是被我替掉的那个前任伴郎吗
The one that I replaced as Barney's best man?

168
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,899
你给我等着 莫斯比
I'm coming for you, Mosby.

169
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,934
比利•扎布卡
Billy Zabka!

170
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,990
十万火急 我需要现采的英国薰衣草
Okay, real quick, I need fresh-cut English lavender,

171
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:49,240
一份莎士比亚的十四行诗第十八首
a copy of Shakespeare's 18th sonnet,

172
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,826
还有足够抹遍一个60岁女人全身的巧克力榛子酱
and enough Nutella to cover a 60-year-old woman.

173
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,029
好吧 你们居然逃跑了
Oh, great. You guys escaped.

174
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,363
营救成功哈
Got rescued!

175
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,698
你们还好吗
Are you okay?

176
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,033
受了点惊吓
A bit shaken up.

177
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,901
被困电梯很恐怖的
Being trapped in an elevator is scary.

178
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,837
不 是巴尼放下来一台电视
No, Barney lowered in a TV

179
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,257
播的声情并茂的70年代黄片太吓人了
showing some pretty graphic 1970s pornography.

180
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,459
还是有很多熟脸的哈
Still, a lot of familiar faces in there.

181
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,927
好吧 不只是脸
Well, not just faces.

182
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,129
我得找我老婆去
I'm gonna go find my wife.

183
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:16,250
看你干的好事
Nice job, bro.

184
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,919
自打妈妈怀上我以来
Mom was just about to get some action

185
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,554
这是她头一回准备采取点行动
for the first time since she conceived me.

186
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,922
巴尼 你得停手了
Barney, this has to stop.

187
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,107
你妄想症又发作了吧
You're being delusional.

188
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,325
妈妈才不会和杰瑞复合
Mom is not getting back together with Jerry.

189
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,928
因为她要和我爸爸复合啦
Because she's getting back together with my daddy!

190
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,913
我看出来你的猫腻了
I see what you're doing.

191
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,064
你把你爸带来不是为了给我俩证婚
You didn't bring your dad here to marry us.

192
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,116
而是想让他跟妈妈复合啊
You want him to get back together with Mom!

193
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,519
这太没天理了好吗
Which is completely insane, by the way.

194
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,988
呃 我爸爸单身 妈妈也是单身
Um, my dad's single, Mom's single.

195
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,956
而你爸婚姻幸福 儿女绕膝
Your dad's happily married with two kids.

196
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,291
哪个更能说得通
Which one makes more sense?

197
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,859
好吧 我同意 算平手
I agree. It's a tie.

198
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,044
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

199
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,178
你闪边
You back down

200
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,763
让我爸爸和妈妈重归于好
and let me get my mom and dad back together?

201
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,265
呃 不如你闪边
Um, how about you back down

202
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,384
让我爸爸和妈妈重归于好
and let me get my mom and dad back together?

203
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,519
我已经脑补出画面了
I can already picture it.

204
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,275
* 我们复合了呀 幸福欢乐多呀 *
We're reunited and we're going so strong

205

And Barney makes three

213
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,914
* 我们爱你 小家伙 *
We love you, champ!

214
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,615

215
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:31,969
* 我一点意见也没有呀 *
And I'm totally cool with it!

216
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,972
你精神病忘吃药了吧
That's completely insane.

217
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,924
事情会是这样的
This is how it's gonna be.

218
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:40,878
* 我们复合了呀 我好欢乐多呀 *
We're reunited and I'm feeling so glad

219
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,597
* 我比巴尼爸爸性感好多呀 *
I'm so much sexier than Barney's dad

220
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:48,436
* 破镜又重圆呀 生活回正轨呀 *
Back together, now our life's right on track

221
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:51,856
* 但她背着你爸 偷偷上我爸呀 *
But she's banging my dad behind your dad's back

222
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:56,143
* 你去上班时 我就在她身后呀 *
When you're at work, I'm all over her rack

223
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:57,095
* 他乱说 *
That's not true

224
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,095
* 才没有 *
Yes, it is

225
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,280
* 不好笑 *
That's not funny

226
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,765
* 妈妈 插播一下 *
Mom, break the news

227
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,334
* 好呀 我们像小兔 尽情啪啪啪 *
Okay, we're screwin' like bunnies

228

231

232
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,345

234
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,000

No, my dad would win in a fight! Nuh-uh!

235
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,169
别打啦
Don't fight!

236
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:24,004
我要嫁进这家门啊
I'm marrying into this family. 

237
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:25,856
-你个傻蛋  -我才不停
-You stupid! -I won't stop.

238
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,977
滑伞的地方到底在哪啊
Where the heck is this parasailing place?

239
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,195
你等一下
You know what?

240
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,863
我得 我得给杰瑞打个电话
I'm gonna... I'm gonna call Jerry.

241
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,366
奇了怪了
Oh, that's weird.

242
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,201
我一点信号都收不到了
I just lost cell reception.

243
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,036
是吗
Yes.

244
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,622
真是奇怪呢
Weird.

245
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:46,327
这个旅馆里美画连连啊
Lot of pretty paintings in this hotel.

246
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,462
而且一个个裱得也好看
I like how they've been... framed.

247
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,462
{\a6}frame双关裱和陷害

248
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,081
我也注意到了那些古色古香的
I've noticed the vintage, antique,

249
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,633
镀金维多利亚风格的画框
gilded Victorian frames, too.

250
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,719
我又不瞎 你想说什么
I'm not blind... but what are you getting at?

251
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,354
你跟我装什么二愣子呢
You know damn well what I'm getting at!

252
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,223
你嫉妒我又做回了伴郎
You're jealous I got the Best Mansmanship back,

253
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,542
所以你想出毒计 毁了那签名照片
so you destroyed that photo as part of some diabolical scheme

254
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:03,427
就是为了让我难堪
to make me look bad.

255
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,346
你肯定还准备了另一张韦恩•格雷茨基的照片
I bet you even found some other photo of Wayne Gretzky

256
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,514
就是为了关键时刻出来力挽狂澜对不对
so you could swoop in and save the day.

257
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,848
-你有病吧你  -有吗
-You're insane. -Am I?

258
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,983
-你就是  -是吗  -绝对是
-Yeah. -Am I? - Yeah.

259
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,735
下午三点十五的时候你在哪
Where were you today at 3:15 p.M.?

260
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,904
就在这里享受了
Right here getting a massage.

261
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,190
六十分钟的深层组织按摩
Rocked a 60-minute deep tish.

262
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,108
现在要是没什么事 大侦探
Now if you'll excuse me, Detective,

263
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,227
我就吃菠萝去了
I think I'll go have some pineapple.

264
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,746
你怎么知道菠萝那事的
How do you know about that?

265
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,032
地球人都知道啊
Everybody knows about that!

266
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:28,169
-打扰一下  -什么事
-Excuse me? -Mm?

267
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,920
是你毁了那张照片 对不对
You destroyed that photo, didn't you?

268
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,071
不是我干的
No, I didn't.

269
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,406
别装了 我向领班投诉你了
Admit it! I complained about you

270
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,875
你就想报复我
to the bell captain, so you got your revenge.

271
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,544
你向领班投诉我了吗
You complained about me?

272
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:40,047
没有
No.

273
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,101
慢点走 克劳德
So, Claude...

274
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,387
我听说你是蒙特利尔加拿大人队的球迷
I see that you're a Montreal Canadiens fan.

275
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:49,390
也就是说你讨厌埃德蒙顿油工队
Which means you hate the Edmonton Oilers,

276
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:51,559
这也解释了你为什么会毁了韦恩•格雷茨基的大头照
which is why you destroyed the Wayne Gretzky head shot!

277
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:52,643
我指控你
J'accuse!

278
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:54,428
你这叫毫无根据
C'est ridicule!

279
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,980
要是毫无根据的话
If it's so ridicule,

280
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:58,983
那你怎么解释你的手
how do you explain this?

281
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:03,437
看起来我抓到了... 你沾满墨水的双手
Ah, seems like I've caught you...midnight blue-handed.

282
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,955
你说这个啊
Oh, these. Yeah.

283
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,575
当时我在海边
I-I was out by the water when...

284
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:11,212
一个老年塔法里人驾驶着滑翔机
an elderly R-Rastafarian hang glider...

285
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:13,664
掉到了沙滩上的一只乌贼上
he-he crash onto a beached squid,

286
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,751
我过去救人的时候被墨汁溅上了
which squirted ink when I ran in to help.

287
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,786
就这个破理由你还指望我信你吗
You really expect me to believe that?

288
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,790
证据确凿
Story checks out.

289
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,725
错怪你了 克劳德
Sorry, Claude.

290
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,261
没关系
De rien.

291
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:29,013
我没搞明白
I don't get it.

292
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:29,980
本来好好的
We were bonding.

293
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:34,435
我什么都没做错好吗
I can't think of anything I did wrong!

294
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:36,303
好吧 做了那么几件错事
Okay, I did a few things wrong.

295
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:37,688
我最后一次重申
For the last time,

296
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,808
我没把你买的那些橙子放在车顶
I did not leave the bag of oranges you bought on the roof!

297
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:46,780
别再超速了啊
No more breaking the speed limit. And, uh,

298
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:50,367
多谢提醒我她跑到了67英里
thanks for flagging me down and telling me she was going 67.

299
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:50,367
{\a6}美国高速限速65英里

300
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,202
只是做个守法公民罢了 警官
Just following the rules, Officer.

301
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:55,489
对了 她还没系安全带
Oh. She's also not wearing her seat belt.

302
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,010
那个词不是你能用的
You are not allowed to use that word!

303
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,263
只有我们才能用
Only we're allowed to use that word!

304
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:04,632
对不起
I am so sorry.

305
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,135
我以后再也不敢叫你或别人
I will never call you or anyone else a...

306
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:10,054
星际脑残粉了
Trekkie again.

307
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:12,556
但是我道过歉你也接受了
But I apologized and you accepted.

308
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,858
我还买了橙子赔给你
I even bought you more oranges.

309
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,349
我气的不是你 明白了吗
Look, it wasn't you, okay?

310
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,719
宝贝 我知道你在模拟联合国的发言很重要
Baby, I know your speech at the Model U.N. Is a big deal,

311
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,205
但是我不知道我赶不赶得及了
but I'm just not sure I'll make it in time.

312
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,623
我在努力赶路
I'm trying.

313
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,824
你知道吗
You know what?

314
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,543
你直接别来算了
Don't bother coming.

315
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,499
也就是说你当时在机场说的是真的了
So, back at the airport, that story was true?

316
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,533
你有个女儿吗
You have a daughter?

317
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,251
她跟她爸过
She lives with her dad.

318
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:44,705
而且因为我老是出差 总是错过很多
And since I travel for work, I miss a lot of stuff.

319
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:49,009
我努力工作也是为了让她过上好日子
I only work as hard as I do to provide for her.

320
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:52,346
孩子不认逻辑
But kids, they don't understand logic.

321
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,815
孩子只认有谁陪伴
Kids understand who shows up.

322
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,818
这就是为什么她爸爸是她的英雄
That's why her dad's her hero...

323
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,572
而我却被挂电话
and I get hung up on.

324
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,073
去看你女儿的演讲吧
Go see your daughter's speech.

325
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,159
只要你出现 一切都会被原谅的
If you show up, all will be forgiven.

326
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,410
别管这事儿了
Just drop it.

327
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,362
直接开回我家吧
And drop me at home.

328
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:09,947
然后赶快去你那场婚礼
Then head out to your wedding.

329
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,582
讨论结束
End of discussion.

330
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,252
巴尼 哪怕你的计划能成功
Barney, even if your plan worked,

331
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,920
你也毁了你爸爸的婚姻啊
you'd be destroying your dad's marriage.

332
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,072
好吧 你说的有那么一点道理
Okay, you may have a point.

333
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,207
我能提个建议吗
Can I suggest something?

334
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:21,925
休战吧
Truce?

335
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,910
我们都同意放下这件事如何
We both agree to drop this.

336
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,912
同意
Agreed.

337
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,364
对了 我新换了一瓶
Hey, I got a replacement bottle

338
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:30,184
-30年陈的格伦•麦肯纳  -好
-of 30-year Glen McKenna. -Okay.

339
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,553
听着 就算妈妈再也没有跟
Look, even if Mom never gets back together

340
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:35,305
我们俩的爸爸之一复合 我们仍然是兄弟
with either one of our dads, we're still brothers.

341
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,274
这可不是比赛
It's not a competition.

342
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,113
我赢啦
I win!

343
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,657
把你的臭手从我妈身上拿下来
Get your damn hands off my mom!

344
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,375
把你的臭手放到我妈身上去
Get your damn hands on my mom!

345
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:52,709
一只放上去一只拿下来吗
One on, one off?

346
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,845
这到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

347
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,980
几年前 在你们哥俩找到山姆之后
After you boys tracked Sam down a few years back,

348
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,949
我们联系上了 我们又成为了朋友
we got in touch. We became friends again,

349
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,984
-开始一起玩  -然后某一天
-started hanging out. -And then one day,

350
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,420
她从洛蕾塔变成了...
she went from being Loretta to being...

351
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,555
洛♀蕾♀塔
Lo-ret-ta.

352
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:06,974
我们想等等再告诉你们
We wanted to wait to tell you

353
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,191
因为时间还不长
because it's still new,

354
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,060
但一旦山姆来主持婚礼仪式
but it was inevitable you'd find out

355
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,396
你们肯定会发现这事的
once Sam came to perform the ceremony.

356
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:13,847
这是你俩的亲密用语吗
Is that what you two call it?

357
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:16,233
"主持婚礼仪式"
"Performing the ceremony"?

358
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:17,484
不 山姆明天会为你证婚啊 亲爱的
Oh, Sam's marrying you tomorrow, dear.

359
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,020
哦对 多谢你了 牧师大人
Right. Thank you, Reverend. 

360
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,539
听着 你们可以好好的接受这件事吗
Look, is there any way you guys can be all right with this?

361
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,741
我当然可以啦
Of course I am!

362
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:27,377
巴尼呢
Barney?

363
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,330
我知道我今天一直不正常 但...
I know I've been acting crazy today, but...

364
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,549
我只有一个真正想问的问题 妈妈
I just have one real question, Mom,

365
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,367
我希望得到诚实的回答
and I want an honest answer.

366
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,136
有没有这样一刻
Is there a scenario--

367
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,170
听我说完
and hear me out--

368
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,339
你曾经考虑过
where you might consider

369
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,875
跟我们俩的爸爸们一起来个三人行呢
doing kind of a three-way deal with both of our dads?

370
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:44,061
-天哪 你到底什么毛病  -喂 老弟 说什么呢
-God! What is wrong with you?! -Oh, dude, come on!

371
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,313
我就知道会这样
That's what I thought!

372
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,018
是时候承认了 泰德
It's time to admit it, Ted.

373
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,654
是你自己弄洒了墨水 根本就没有什么阴谋
You spilled the ink. There's no conspiracy.

374
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:55,022
我想也是吧
I guess you're right.

375
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,440
我是说 只剩下最后一个
I mean, the only other person

376
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,742
看到巴尼给我那张照片的人了...
who saw Barney give me that photo...

377
00:14:58,744 --> 00:14:59,993
就是你
was you.

378
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,063
嘿 白痴
Hey. Idiot.

379
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,731
在你忙着玩侦探游戏的时候
While you've been playing detective,

380
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,117
我一直在帮你收拾烂摊子
I've been cleaning up your mess.

381
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:10,236
看 消字灵很有效呢
Look, the ink remover works.

382
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:11,004
我去把这个弄好
I'm gonna finish this.

383
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:13,090
你去向巴尼坦白
You come clean to Barney.

384
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,574
好吧
Okay.

385
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,626
她已经消失一整天了
She's been missing all day,

386
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:20,881
而且我在我床上找到一张疑似自杀留言的东西
a-and I found what appears to be a-a suicide note on my bed.

387
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,350
但语气并不像她
But it doesn't really sound like her.

388
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:27,854
"我要杀了我...等一下...自己"
"I'm going to kill my-- wait for it-- self."

389
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,274
扎布卡先生还好吗
Is everything okay with Mr. Zabka?

390
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:35,261
等等 等一下 你为什么认为那是比利•扎布卡
Wait. W-Wait. Why do you think that's Billy Zabka?

391
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,766
看到没
See?

392
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,735
是大堂那个男人做的这个按摩
The man from the lobby got this massage.

393
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,820
一位年轻一些的先生作为礼物送他的
A younger gentleman bought it for him as a gift.

394
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,238
还帮他签名了
He even signed his name for him.

395
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,439
就在这儿
Right here.

396
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,304
我告诉你们...
I'm telling all y'all...

397
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,006
这是扎布卡破坏
it's Zabka-tage.

398
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,006
{\a6}原词为sabotage 蓄意破坏

399

* 我已忍无可忍 我知道你掌控了全局 *
I can't stand it, I know you planned it

401
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,512
* 我这就要把一切澄清 整个局中局 *
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate

402
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:10,296
* 我在里面已经不能忍受其中的韵律 *
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here

403
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:12,632
* 因为你的水晶球并不像你说的那样清澈透明 *
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear

404
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:16,302
* 当你靠着椅子思考为什么的时候 *

* 我已芒刺在手 *

00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:23,326
莉莉在这个周末的第二次虎扑
Lily's second tackle of the weekend.

407
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:26,947
毁灭吧
Sabotage.

408
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,915
醒一醒吧 我们到了
Wakey, wakey.

409
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,237
等等 这不是...
Wait, this isn't...

410
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,589
这是你女儿的学校
It's your daughter's school.

411
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,174
你需要进去
You need to go in.

412
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,159
她说让我不要来了
She asked me not to come, Marshall.

413
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:41,545
这完全讲不通啊
This doesn't make any sense.

414
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,346
孩子不认逻辑
Kids don't understand logic.

415
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:46,550
孩子只认有谁陪伴
Kids understand who shows up.

416
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:08,622
人们常说 孩子就是未来
People say children are the future.

417
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:10,190
我说...
I say...

418
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,658
石油才是未来
oil is the future!

419
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,044
少听点那些胆小如鼠娘们儿唧唧的环保主义者的屁话
Don't listen to these gutless environmental sissies!

420
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,862
-这才是我姑娘  -勘探海洋
-That's my baby. -Drill in the oceans!

421
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,497
-谢谢你  -勘探湿地
-Thank you. -Drill in the wetlands!

422
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:19,299
-傻冒  -勘探国家公园  
-Pumpkin head. -Drill in the national parks!

423
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:20,533
不客气
You're welcome.

424
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:22,135
宝贝 快来钻 宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill! Drill, baby, drill!

425
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:24,204
-宝贝 快来钻  -我们该走了
-Drill, baby, drill! -We should go.

426
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,506
宝贝 快来钻 宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill! Drill, baby, drill!

427
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:29,843
宝贝 快来钻 宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill! Drill, baby, drill!

428
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,344
宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill!

429
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:32,979
你都说了
You said it was nuts

430
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:35,215
我让我的父母重归于好这个想法很疯狂
to think that my mom and dad would get back together.

431
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:36,716
但是詹姆斯和我想得一样
But that's what happened for James.

432
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:39,069
我从五岁开始就一直幻想着
I've been dreaming of that since I was five.

433
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,055
当然除了这个以外 还想要一个我自己能操控的死星
Well, that and my own operational Death Star.

434
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,055
{\a6}星球大战中黑武士毁灭星球的空间站

435
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:44,357
但最主要还是他们重归于好
But mostly them getting back together.

436
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,359
为什么詹姆斯的想法实现了 我却没有
Why does James get it and I don't?

437
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:47,444
嗯 你想想
Well, think about it.

438
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,996
你有了我 你爸爸有了谢丽尔
You have me, your dad has Cheryl...

439
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,081
所以 综上所述
"So to summarize:

440
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,165
我死定了
"I'm super dead,

441
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,668
你应该和洛蕾塔好好啪啪啪
"You should totally bone Loretta,

442
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,254
我从未爱过你 谢丽尔
"And I never loved you, Cheryl,"

443
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,923
名字还拼错了
which is misspelled.

444
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,842
...詹姆斯刚刚离婚
...but James is going through a divorce.

445
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,743
他刚刚失去了家庭
He just lost his family.

446
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:06,796
我知道你一直有这个梦想 但是...
I-I know you've been dreaming of this, but...

447
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,432
也许 他比你更需要"合家欢"里面的情节
maybe he needs "Mom and Dad" More than you.

448
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:14,554
所以 比利 你真的觉得你能瞒天过海吗
So, Billy, did you really think you could get away with it?

449
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:15,605
实话说 我是这么想的
Actually, I did.

450
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:16,473
-啊  -我本来想
-Ah. I was gonna

451
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,757
把这个给巴尼的
give this to Barney

452
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,859
然后说我开了一个小时的车
and say I'd driven an hour away

453
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,977
在一个卖签名照的人手里买了一个新的
to get a replacement from an autograph dealer.

454
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,879
首先 我需要不在场证明
First, I needed an alibi.

455
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,781
所以我让巴尼的爸爸去做按摩
So I got Barney's dad a massage

456
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:27,067
但是我签的是自己的名字
but signed in my name.

457
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:30,436
接下来我把格雷茨基的大头照换成我
Then I switched the Gretzky head shot with one of myself.

458
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:33,206
我后备箱里常年放着
I always travel with 2,000 of those handsome devils

459
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,408
两千多张我英俊的小恶魔照片
in the trunk of my car.

460
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:39,746
我有无数个问题要问你 但是首先...
I have so many questions for you, but first...

461
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:43,166
你为什么把两千多张你的大头照放在你车里
you keep 2,000 head shots of yourself in your trunk?

462
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,968
因为没人要啊 他们只想要
No one ever wants them! They only want

463
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,170
好人的签名照
the "Good guy's" Autograph!

464
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:49,806
在80年代 我在每部电影里都是反面人物
In the '80s, I was the bad guy in every movie.

465
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:52,425
你知道我人生是什么样子的吗
Do you know what my life has been like?

466
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:55,812
每次首映 当我出现的时候...
Every premiere, when I came on-screen...

467
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,565
但我在生活中不是坏人啊
I wasn't a bad guy in real life,

468
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,400
只是一个很不错的演员啊
just a kick-ass actor.

469
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:01,818
但是没人懂我...
No one got that.

470
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,970
不管我在哪都有人这么做
It happened everywhere I went.

471
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:06,606
也不知道为什么 他们总有爆米花在他们手里
Somehow, people always had popcorn.

472
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:10,577
{\a6}功夫小子中的经典桥段

473
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:10,577
二十五年了 我都在被人踢爆蛋蛋
25 years of getting crane-kicked in the nuts,

474
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:14,447
直到巴尼•斯丁森给了我人生中最光彩夺目的一天
until Barney Stinson gave me the best moment of my life.

475
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:17,083
嘿 嘿 泰德那边出了一点问题 所以...
Hey. Hey, some issues just came up with Ted, so...

476
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:18,335
你愿意当我的伴郎吗
will you be my best man?

477
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:19,703
-当然  -谢谢
-Sure. -Thanks.

478
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:24,791
-喂  -妈
-Hello? -Mom?

479
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,760
别 别 听着 听
No, no, listen, listen.

480
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:29,012
我刚成了某人的伴郎
I just became somebody's best man.

481
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:32,665
今年感恩节你可以来了
You can come to Thanksgiving this year!

482
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,001
在巴尼•斯丁森眼中 我不是坏人
To Barney Stinson, I wasn't a bad guy.

483
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:39,339
在巴尼•斯丁森眼中 我是他的伴郎
To Barney Stinson, I was the best man.

484
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:43,059
我就想着要是泰德再搞砸一次 我就又有机会了
I thought if Ted screwed up again, I'd have another shot.

485
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,613
想必 我这回真的是个坏人了
But I guess this time I really was the bad guy.

486
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:48,281
怎么了 泰德 什么事情这么紧急
Hey, Ted, what's so urgent?

487
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,867
有些事情我要告诉你
I have something to tell you.

488
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,687
我把格雷茨基的大头照毁了
I destroyed that Gretzky head shot

489
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:57,190
我修复不了 比利力挽狂澜
and I couldn't fix it. Billy saved the day

490
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,960
跑到附近的卖签名照的地方买了个新的
by getting a new one from an autograph dealer nearby.

491
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:01,127
一小时车程呢
A-An hour away.

492
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:03,163
对对 一小时 淡定点
An hour away. Just be cool.

493
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,131
太棒了 谢谢你 比利
Awesome. Thanks, Billy!

494
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,054
还有 泰德
And, Ted...

495
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:13,423
我很高兴你说了实话
I really appreciate that you told the truth.

496
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,141
-痛  -去你的
-Ow -Psych!

497
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:16,676
比利牛人 泰德衰人
Billy rules, Ted drools,

498
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:17,877
斯丁森闪人
Stinson out.

499
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,765
没事啦 莫斯比
You're all right, Mosby.

500
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:25,235
而就是这百年难见的神奇周末
And for an all too rare moment that weekend,

501
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,719
竟然一切安好
everything was all right.

502
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,194
呃 巴尼
Um, Barney?

503
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,746
你就是这样支持我们的吗
Is this your way of saying you're supporting us?

504
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:38,398
是的 快上吧
Yes! Go for it.

505
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,950
达到爱的巅峰吧
Consummate your love!

506
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:42,619
谢谢了 兄弟
Thanks, bro.

507
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:46,456
但这很奇怪啊
But this is super weird.

508
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,076
各种奇怪
Super weird.

509
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,451
我们快到了吗
Are we almost there?

510
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:56,985
很快就到了
Almost there.

511
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:01,287
还我老婆 你个贱人
Give me back my wife, you son of a bitch!

512
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,340
