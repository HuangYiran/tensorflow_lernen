你多久沒來了  阿爾伯特
When was the last time you was here, Albert?

147
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,320
最小的孩子出生后就沒來過
My littlest was born.

148
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,730
那有七年了
Oh, seven years?

149
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,920
九年了
Nine.

150
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,330
是她要結婚了嗎
She the one getting married?

151
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,820
九歲的哪能結婚啊
You don't marry off no nine-year-old.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,340
我可見過  在查爾斯頓的皇后街上
I seen it, though, back on Queen Street over in Charleston.

153
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,440
他們在那兒打過一仗
They fought the war over that.

154
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,120
才不是為了那個打仗的呢
That's not why they fought the war.

155
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,790
你這么聰明  說傻話呢
You're too smart to be that dumb.

156
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,840
你叫什么
What's your name?

157
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,400
道特
Daughter.

158
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,650
名字叫這個
That's your name?

159
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,120
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,570
我以前養過條藍斑獵狗  我也沒叫他獵狗啊
Had me a bluetick coon once and didn't call him Hound.

161
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,330
-你長什么樣  -先生
- What you look like? - Sir?

162
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,630
我手放在面前都看不到
I can't see my hand in front of my face.

163
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,850
你得告訴我
You got to tell me.

164
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,550
-我  -她是個美人  奧斯卡
- I... - She a beauty, Oscar.

165
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,570
我不懷疑
I don't doubt it.

166
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,510
我一點不懷疑
I do not doubt it.

167
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,630
威姆斯  你在嗎
Hey, Weems? You there?

168
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,730
-是  先生  -愛麗絲來了嗎
- Yes, sir. - Well, Ayleese show up yet?

169
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,140
她放假
Her day off.

170
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,730
小獵狗  你會做飯嗎
Hey, uh, Bluetick, you cook?

171
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,850
沒辦法才下廚
If I have to.

172
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,000
那快去吧
Well, you best get to it.

173
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,610
你們都跟她去
The rest of y'all go with her.

174
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,990
要我留下嗎  叔叔
You want me to stay, Uncle?

175
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,080
那我就會說了
Ah, if I want that, I say that.

176
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,040
我告訴你東西都在哪
I'll show you where everything is.

177
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
-希望有圍裙  -有的  女士
- Hope there's an apron. - Yes, ma'am, we got that.

178
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,670
你來這兒干什么  阿爾伯特
What you come here for, Albert?

179
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,270
照你說的做
What you told me.

180
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,010
我說的多了
Well, I told you a lot.

181
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,830
都不知道你聽進去沒
Don't know what you heard.

182
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,570
無論如何  不能相信白人
Never trust no buckras, no matter what.

183
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,720
也別相信黑人
Never trust no browns neither.

184
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,110
你都說對了
You was right on both counts.

185
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,420
你得現實點
You need to be realistic.

186
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,880
五十英里之內  再沒這樣的房子了
There isn't a house like it within 50 miles.

187
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,540
這可不是什么好事
That's not to its advantage.

188
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,720
而且你需要一名不問太多問題的買家
And you've needed a buyer who's not inclined to ask too many questions.

189
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,040
我們現在就是這樣
That's what we have here.

190
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,150
三萬七千不少了
$37,000 is a substantial sum.

191
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,990
-對我這種人來說  -對誰都不少
- For someone like me. - For anyone.

192
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,720
準將可不會這么想
The Commodore wouldn't think so.

193
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,650
路易會在逆境中盡力而為
Louis would make the best of a bad situation.

194
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,610
我可得拿這筆錢養孩子呢
I'll have to raise a child on it.

195
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,170
余生也都指著這錢了
Support myself for the rest of my life.

196
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,730
-你不是有新情人了嗎  -什么
- Isn't there a new companion? - I'm sorry?

197
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,620
他怎么打算的
What are his intentions?

198
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,890
這可不關你的事
That's really not your concern.

199
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,170
這跟愛情無關  是關于錢
This isn't about love, it's about finances.

200
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,410
我知道你這方面一向精明
I've never known you to be foolish about those.

201
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,980
-或許我變了  -人很少變
- Well, maybe I've changed. - That rarely occurs.

202
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,410
如果你這么認為  利安德  我可憐你
If that's how you feel, Leander, I pity you.

203
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,980
我強烈要求你接受那個條件
I urge you to take the offer.

204
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,170
費里先生  我要是輸了怎么辦
Mr. Ferry, what if I lose?

205
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,360
總體來說  我們的案子還是非常
Overall, our case is still very--

206
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,990
但是輸了之后會發生什么
But what happens?

207
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,610
上訴  當然了
Appeal, of course.

208
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,780
涉及到撒格斯基的條件是否合適
New concerns regarding the suitability of the Sagorskys,

209
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,630
還有環境正向改變的新問題
positive change in circumstance.

210
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,470
比如說  出售房屋
The sale of the house, just for example.

211
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,950
有足夠資源的話  我們可以僵持好幾年
With enough resources, we can tie it up for years.

212
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,540
-這段期間湯米在哪  -由你撫養
- And where is Tommy during all that? - With you.

213
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,920
由他們撫養  由慈善機構撫養  
With them, a benevolent institution.

214
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,340
都有可能
Those are all possibilities.

215
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,160
特倫頓孤兒撫養院嗎
The Trenton Home for Friendless Children?

216
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,960
說不準具體是哪一家機構
I couldn't say what particular institution--

217
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,370
你知道那里什么樣嗎
Do you know what it's like there?

218
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,510
-這沒有意義  -因為我知道
- There's no point-- - Because I do.

219
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,180
我知道
I do.

220
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
我們這次談話討論的是未來
This conversation is about the future.

221
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,740
童年稍縱即逝
Childhood doesn't last.

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
一切都稍縱即逝
Nothing lasts.

223
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,160
他都不會記得
He won't even remember.

224
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,210
好幾年嗎
Years?

225
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,060
有如下條件你才會贏
The way you win things like this:

226
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,250
時間  資金還有堅持不懈
time, money, and persistence.

227
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,540
一旦抓住就不放手
Grab on and just don't ever let go.

228
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,350
知道對方的能力限度
Knowing the opposition's limited ability...

229
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,560
不斷地投入資金
...to incur ongoing costs,

230
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,250
我們計劃的時間越長
the longer we can draw it out...

231
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,810
喬·馬赫里亞  邁耶·蘭斯基  盧西亞諾
Joe Masseria, Meyer Lansky, Luciano--

232
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,040
拉吉  查理
Lucky, Charlie--

233
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,370
還有佛羅里達的那個人
and the one in Florida.

234
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,190
文森佐·佩德魯塞利
Vincenzo Petrucelli.

235
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,060
沒什么好講的  我沒見過他
Nothing to say. I never met him.

236
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,470
你哥哥呢
Your brother?

237
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,490
把一切都安排好了
Put the whole thing in place,

238
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,760
沒給他選擇的機會
didn't leave him a choice.

239
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,390
這個黑人  這個博士
This dinge they got, the doctor...

240
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,420
他們通過他做生意
they're running it through him.

241
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,350
努基聽一個黑人的指揮
Nucky takes orders from a colored.

242
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
你是這個意思嗎
That's the story you're telling?

243
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,540
金錢
The money, he--

244
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,570
他受不了金錢的誘惑
He can't walk away from that.

245
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,540
-芝加哥那邊呢  -沒參與這件事
- Chicago? - Not part of this.

246
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,440
每月給托里奧和卡彭一萬美金
10,000 a month to Torrio and Capone?

247
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,700
只是在還債
Just paying off a debt.

248
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,610
好吧
All right.

249
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,890
紐約  大西洋城還有坦帕
New York, Atlantic City, Tampa.

250
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,990
這就夠了
That'll have to be enough.

251
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,890
去工作吧
Get to work.

252
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,500
他不會上鉤的  
He won't bite.

253
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,080
我要讓他們在一個屋里  伊萊
I need them all in a room, Eli,

254
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,570
跨越州線來計劃共謀
making plans to operate in collusion across state lines.

255
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,100
是我的目的
That's what I came for.

256
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,170
你猜不透努基的心思
You don't know how Nucky thinks.

257
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,440
-你說他喜歡錢  -不足以讓他收手
- You said he likes the money. - That won't stop him.

258
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,800
他總提到和平
He talks about peace.

259
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,960
他不是真心的  從來都不是
He doesn't mean it. He never has.

260
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,370
你欣賞那一點
You admire that?

261
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,450
你跟我們一起長大的嗎
You grow up in our house?

262
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,880
用報紙當毯子
Newspapers for blankets,

263
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,420
晚餐偷土豆來吃
stolen potatoes for supper.

264
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,480
要不就餓肚子
Or nothing.

265
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,630
連續餓兩天
That night or the next.

266
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,520
那種滋味永遠忘不了
You don't forget.

267
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,440
你現在不餓肚子了
You're not starving now.

268
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,070
-他是我哥  -他不是你兒子的父親
- He's my brother. - He's not the father of your son.

269
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,790
沒讓他進監獄  不是嗎
Kept him out of jail, didn't he?

270
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,050
這個我說不準
I wouldn't bet on that.

271
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,460
克萊頓·戴維斯的判決馬上到了
Clayton Davies' trial's coming up.

272
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,940
如果他的律師發現
What happens if his attorney finds out about the evidence

273
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,690
被人買通壓下的證據怎么辦
somebody was paid to suppress?

274
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,090
把這次會議開成  要不然
Make the meeting happen, or don't--

275
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,360
你自己承擔后果
the consequences are for you to live with.

276
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,460
但是要記住
But just bear this in mind--

277
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,490
不管你有什么借口
whatever your excuse,

278
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,090
你跟我是一條船上的人
you and I are down this road together.

279
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,060
把這話跟那個忘不了過去的人說說
Explain that to a man who never forgets.

280
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
你渾身酒氣
You smell of whiskey.

281
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,370
-跟你有什么關系  -別喝了
- What's it to you? - Lay off it.

282
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,340
我不喜歡酒鬼
You're no good to me like that.

283
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,960
烤面包
Crunchy toast?

284
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
是木莓果醬面包
It's raspberry jam.

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,310
聽起來很不錯
That does sound good.

286
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,720
你認識我  對吧
You know me, don't you?

287
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,370
你是奶奶
You're Mima.

288
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,000
但我是誰
But who am I?

289
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,260
我是你媽媽嗎
Am I your mother?

290
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,830
不是
No.

291
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,410
她在哪
Where is she?

292
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,350
她死了
She's gone.

293
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,450
你爸爸呢
And your father?

294
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,000
他在哪
Where is he?

295
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,210
我不知道
I don't know.

296
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,690
我也不知道
I don't either.

297
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,890
太糟了是吧
Isn't it terrible?

298
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,520
你過來好嗎  求你了
Would you come to me? Please?

299
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,980
別碰他
Don't touch him.

300
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,850
-你住在這里  -你不是
- You live here. - You don't.

301
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,840
你不會把我怎么樣的
You wouldn't.

302
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,340
至少不會當著他的面
Not in front of him.

303
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,450
你離開就好
You just need to leave.

304
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,390
這是你和他的計劃嗎
Is this how you planned it with her?

305
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,810
搶走我珍愛的一切
To take everything away that matters?

306
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,640
我沒計劃任何事
I didn't plan anything.

307
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,070
但還是發生了
But it happened anyway.

308
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,450
是吉米的
They're Jimmy's.

309
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,610
他不應該有點
Shouldn't he have something

310
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,670
懷念他爸爸的東西嗎
to remember?

311
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,660
不應該這樣嗎
Wouldn't that be right?

312
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,720
留好了
Keep these safe.

313
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,200
你手指上有個戒指
There's a ring on your finger.

314
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,520
是的
Yes.

315
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,800
你們倆
And you'll both...

316
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,990
好好照顧他
take good care of him.

317
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,340
到了
Okay, then.

318
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,070
那些人也一起吃飯嗎
Are those men coming to dinner too?

319
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,990
他們是保護努基叔叔的
They keep an eye on things for Uncle Nucky.

320
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,590
海灘的天氣真不錯
Lovely day for the beach.

321
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,710
信天翁

322
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,240
怎么了
What's wrong?

323
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,310
大老遠地來吃飯
Haul all the way out here.

324
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,780
他在示好
He's making a gesture.

325
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,540
對我們來說更不容易
Bigger effort for us than for him.

326
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,060
受不了你們兩個
Honestly, the two of you.

327
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,300
你們好啊  伙計們
Ahoy, mateys.

328
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,720
-請求上船  -批準
- Permission to come aboard? - Permission granted.

329
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,270
廚房還需要幫忙吧
You probably need a hand in the kitchen?

330
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,070
不  一切都準備好了
No, everything's been taken care of.

331
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,460
誰想先去游泳
Who's up for a swim first?

332
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,740
-我想  我  -我先游
-I am! Me! - Me first!

333
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,880
屋頂修好了嗎
You tend to that roof yet?

334
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,740
我會去修的
I'll get around to it.

335
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,480
-它自己可不能修好  -這是常識
- It don't fix itself. - Natural fact.

336
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,250
房子會歸你的  溫斯頓  你記住了
House goes to you, Winston. You mind that.

337
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,690
我跟你說  要修的地方可不少
A lot to look after, I tell you what.

338
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,210
房子是我姐姐尤拉莉亞的
House belonged to my sister Eulalia.

339
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,840
-為什么  -我名下什么都沒有
- How that? - Don't keep nothing in my name,

340
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,120
什么都沒有
not a damn thing.

341
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,880
她是我媽
She my mother.

342
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,170
-她什么時候去世的  -十二年了
- When did she pass? - 12 year now.

343
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,420
溫斯頓需要有人來撫養
And Winston needed raising.

344
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,870
我可以給你找個地方  奧斯卡  你知道的
I'd have made a place for you, Oscar, you know that.

345
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,610
我不知道
I don't know that.

346
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,750
把你在鎮上安頓好了
Set you up proper in town.

347
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,370
我不是無處可去  我來這是因為我想來
I didn't have to. I came here because I meant to.

348
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,220
你玩兒完了  就玩兒完了
When you're done, you're done.

349
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,260
是不是
Ain't that right?

350
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,320
這是常識
Natural fact.

351
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,450
跟你說
Tell you what.

352
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,740
安頓我  你看看你惹的麻煩
Set me up, with the mess you make.

353
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,860
沒必要的話不要跟
Don't never do no business

354
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,010
那些白人做生意
with no ofay smile you don't have to.

355
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,200
他是你朋友  現在又不是了
He's your friend? Not your friend now.

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,250
不要跟那些
Yeah, don't ever go near no

357
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,010
紐約的自大狂走得太近
biggity da-da-da from New York.

358
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,410
全是口蜜腹劍
A lot of sugar up there.

359
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,270
你知道什么
What you know about it?

360
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,890
-就是一幫惡人  -現在不一樣了
- Just a tangle of vipers. - It different now.

361
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,470
才沒有不一樣  阿爾伯特  都一樣
It ain't different, Albert. It ain't different.

362
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,390
你們都有活力了  生活節奏變快了  
You're all lit up and faster,

363
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,910
但都一個樣
but ain't no different.

364
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,600
你忘了你自己是誰
And you forget who you are.

365
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,340
你跟一個寄生蟲女人
You come runnin' down here with some

366
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,990
跑到這里來
easy rider woman by your side.

367
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,090
因為你不知道該走哪條路
'Cause you don't know which way to turn.

368
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,410
我說的對吧
Ain't that so?

369
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,640
對吧
Huh?

370
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,670
我是來找你幫忙的  奧斯卡
I come to you for help, Oscar.

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,440
瞧瞧你四周
Look around you.

372
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,980
我們在這里怎么幫你
How we gonna help you here?

373
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,220
我們全都要去海邊
We all go down the shore.

374
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,440
干什么
And do what?

375
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,600
給他們洗澡
Wash them boys away.

376
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,650
有什么意義
Ah. Where your sense at?

377
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,780
不用嚇我
Don't scare me none.

378
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,100
因為你沒做過
'Cause you ain't never done it.

379
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,630
該死的 愛麗絲
Damn. Ayleese!

380
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,790
這雞肉和老婆婆的陰部一樣干
This chicken dry as Grandma's snatch.

381
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,780
-愛麗絲  -她今天不在  本諾先生
- Ayleese! - She ain't here today, Mr. Boneau.

382
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,070
站在那里的是誰
Well, who's that standin' over there?

383
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
你是誰
Who are you?

384
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,420
寄生蟲
The easy rider.

385
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,410
寄...  藍斑獵狗
Easy-- ah! Bluetick.

386
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,300
阿爾伯特  希望她值得
Sure hope she worth it, Albert.

387
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,520
反正她的爛廚藝一毛不值
She sure can't cook worth a damn.

388
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,560
我靠
Damn.

389
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,320
-你來了  -我本來想打電話的...
- You're here. - Yes. I was gonna call as soon as I--

390
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,530
我不在家
I wasn't in.

391
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,500
我出去了
I've been out.

392
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,220
到處走走
Just walking everywhere.

393
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,360
看看那些我多年未去過的地方
Places that I haven't been in years.

394
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,640
都很漂亮
It's all remarkable.

395
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,150
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

396
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,520
沒事
Of course.

397
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,270
-你沒有...  -沒有沒有
- You're not, uh... - No, no.

398
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,640
因為不管有多困難
'Cause that's something you need to fight,

399
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,330
-你都必須全力抗爭  -羅伊  不是那個
- no matter how strong-- - Roy, it's not that.

400
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,490
是
It's...

401
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,720
我感覺
I feel...

402
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,600
我自由了
I'm free.

403
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,630
我終于自由了
I'm finally free.

404
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,100
我知道這里不太方便
I know it's not convenient out here.

405
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,490
沒有問題
Not a problem.

406
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,940
在這種情況下
Under the circumstances.

407
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,390
-我們依然一切  -照舊
- And we still keep everything-- - Looking normal.

408
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
該死的朝琪
Cocksucking Chalky.

409
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,370
他自作自受
He made his bed.

410
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,220
車里發生了什么事
The fuck happened in that car?

411
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,020
他逃了  躺在某條臭水溝里
He's on the lam, facedown in a ditch somewhere.

412
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,580
為什么  我沒有警告過他嗎
For what? Didn't I warn him?

413
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,530
我還坐在那誰的對面
And now I'm sitting across from... whatever he is.

414
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,730
-博士還是啥  -他在告訴我該做什么
- Doctor or something. - He's telling me what I have to do?

415
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,030
-告訴我  -就像你是他兒子
- Telling me. - Like you're his boy.

416
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,590
和平是他媽的無稽之談
There is no goddamn peace.

417
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,350
上次我們勉強擺平
We squeaked by last time.

418
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,940
你準備好再來一次嗎
You ready for that again?

419
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,560
我剛虎落平陽  這就是你的建議
I just roll over? That's what you suggest?

420
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,700
聽我說
Hear me out.

421
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,450
讓大家坐下來
Let's get everyone to sit down--

422
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,910
我們  紐約  佛羅里達
us, New York, Florida.

423
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,170
-共商大計  -就一點...
- Work out terms. - Just a friendly little--

424
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,640
那晚在麗茲  是你自己說的
You said it yourself that night in the Ritz,

425
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
同心協力  共謀計策
all work together, take the next step.

426
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,270
現在是時候了吧
Maybe now's the time.

427
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,290
結束這種狀況  讓一切還原
Get the rules in place, put an end to this.

428
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,990
我不住麗茲了
I'm not in the Ritz anymore.

429
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,600
你不想搶回來嗎
Don't you want it back?

430
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,280
我想  全部拿回來
I want it back. All of it.

431
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,450
做好準備吧  努基  趁還有人可以用
Set it up now, Nuck, while there's still a hand to play.

432
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,490
你不信任誰
Who don't you trust?

433
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,350
-什么  -我們這邊  你不信任誰
- Huh? - On our side, who don't you trust?

434
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,910
你為什么這么問
Why are you even asking?

435
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
因為好奇
Because I'm curious.

436
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,730
巴德
Bader.

437
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,640
巴德算個屁
Bader's nothing.

438
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,550
我會處理好巴德
I'll deal with Bader.

439
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,220
米恩斯說  我這邊有內鬼
Means told me there's a skunk in my cellar.

440
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,360
那個司法人員
The Justice guy?

441
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,960
他自始自終都是個騙子  
He's a bunco artist, start to finish.

442
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,390
他說二十萬  你相信嗎
200 grand, he says. Believe that?

443
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,330
-看吧  -他有什么
- There you go. - But what's he got?

444
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,310
錢給他  查清楚  你覺得值得
Pay him and find out, you think it's worth it.

445
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,510
禁酒探員
The Prohee.

446
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,700
-諾克斯  -你也關心過
- Knox? - You had concerns.

447
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,980
只是因為埃迪出了事
Uh... that was just during the whole Eddie thing.

448
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,580
誰知道出了什么事
Who knew what was going on?

449
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,760
你的看法是什么
What's your take, though?

450
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,880
據我所知  他喜歡錢
Far as I can see, he likes the money.

451
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,510
某天他會成為你的麻煩
Be your headache one day.

452
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,930
我的麻煩
Mine?

453
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,010
不過你可以處理好
And you can deal with all of it.

454
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,800
你要去哪里
You off somewhere?

455
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,560
媽媽問你把保暖鍋放哪里去了
Ma wants to know where you keep the chafing dishes.

456
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,200
只是關于它的價值 不過沒關系
It's a fraction of what it's worth, but it doesn't matter.

457
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,210
你自己說的  太大了
You said it yourself-- it's too big.

458
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,420
對這里來說太大了
It's too big for here.

459
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,590
那些人都不到城里來了
Those people don't come to town anymore.

460
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,170
畢竟是一大筆錢
And it's a substantial sum, after all.

461
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,730
大家真的需要多少錢呢
I mean, how much does anybody really need?

462
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,410
他會好起來的  他會的
And he'll be better off. He will be.

463
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,120
話糙  但是這是事實
It hurts to say it, but I know it's true.

464
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,060
也許某一天
And maybe someday...

465
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,520
我瞎扯呢
I'm nattering.

466
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,010
這不太招人喜歡
Not an appealing quality.

467
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,630
我住嘴  我吃東西
I'm stopping. I'm eating.

468
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,730
好姑娘
Good girl.

469
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,340
你做出了正確的決定  我為你高興
Well, you made the right decision. I'm happy for you.

470
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,780
可你看起來并不高興
You don't look happy.

471
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,560
是嗎
I don't?

472
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,670
有意思
That's funny.

473
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,780
終于得到我想要的東西了
Got what I wanted, finally.

474
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
什么東西
What's that?

475
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,220
收購的事兒
Merger's going through.

476
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,820
A&P會以高昂的價格買下我們的產權
A&P's gonna buy us out for a pretty staggering price.

477
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,990
羅伊
Roy.

478
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,680
這讓我有點不安
It had me on edge for--

479
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,170
其實很不安  我現在可以說
well, more than a little, I can say that now.

480
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,260
結果半路殺出個休森
Turns out it was Hewson who was standing in the way.

481
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,620
我  我不明白
I-- I don't--

482
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,690
我們還和他以及他妻子喝東西
While we had drinks with him and his wife?

483
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,940
-當你和我假裝夫妻的時候  -是的...
- When you and I were married? - Yes, from...

484
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,390
從印第安納來的那位
Indiana. Anyway...

485
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,890
他表面上說好聽的
He was pouring honey in my ear,

486
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,850
可是從一開始他就反對
but he was against it from the start.

487
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,800
有大人物給他送酒
The muckety-mucks gave him the boot.

488
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,280
可他不低調  不過他后來一帆風順
He didn't go quietly, but after that, smooth sailing.

489
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,250
律師們昨天簽字了
The lawyers signed off yesterday.

490
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,900
對我來說是好消息
Big bonus for me.

491
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,360
我們慶祝一番如何
Why aren't we celebrating?

492
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,690
我不知道
I don't know.

493
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,340
我不喜歡結束
I hate when things end.

494
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,990
什么結束
What's ending?

495
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,360
我來這里的目的
What I came here for.

496
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,280
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

497
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,480
他們送我去哪兒我就去哪兒
Wherever they send me.

498
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,070
你對我撒過謊嗎
Have you been lying to me?

499
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,060
-關于什么  -你的妻子
- About what? - Your wife.

500
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,260
我沒有撒謊
I didn't lie about that.

501
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,520
那你要說什么
Then what are you saying?

502
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,330
你經歷了太多
You have been through so much,

503
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,460
我甚至都無法想象的事情
things I can't even imagine.

504
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,680
你已經非常勇敢了  真的
You're very brave. I mean that.

505
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,060
此時你看起來非常美麗
And right now you look so beautiful.

506
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,090
真是個美好的道別
What an awfully gallant good-bye.

507
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,710
我不是道別
I'm not saying good-bye.

508
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,680
我是得離開
I do have to leave.

509
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,940
但我要你跟我一起走
I want you to come with me.

510
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,500
我要你嫁給我
I want you to marry me.

511
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,410
真的嫁給我
Really marry me.

512
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,220
這就是我的心愿
That's what I want.

513
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,480
那你為什么不問我呢
What's stopping you from asking?

514
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,830
剛剛不是問了嗎
Hell, I thought I just did.

515
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,660
-他做什么呢  -我不應該說的
- What does he do? - I'm not supposed to talk about it.

516
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,300
-不能告訴你的家人嗎  -我能嗎
- If you can't tell your family... - Should I?

517
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,950
我得說  我們做事兒
I'd say we're all pretty good

518
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,830
都非常小心謹慎
at keeping things close to the vest.

519
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,730
-你們不能吧  -我會保守秘密的
- Not sure about you. - I can keep my mouth shut.

520
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,590
-不  你不能  -你剛剛都說漏嘴了
- No, you can't. - You just said something.

521
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,550
-我不知道已經開始了  -告訴我們
- I didn't know we started. - Tell us.

522
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,840
他鎖了辦公室的門
Well, he shuts his office door,

523
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,170
脫了褲子到處走
walks around with his trousers off.

524
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,270
市長
The mayor?

525
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,320
不想把褲子弄皺了
Doesn't want to get 'em wrinkled.

526
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,270
我覺得是一個會贏的競選戰略
Sounds to me like a winning campaign strategy.

527
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,980
不清楚  我覺得巴卡拉克會大獲全勝
I don't know. I think Bacharach might beat the pants off him.

528
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,980
{\an8}會把他贏得褲子也不剩

529
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,800
很好吧
Pretty good, huh?

530
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,140
下一站  鋼鐵碼[娛樂場所]
Next stop: the Steel Pier.

531
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,200
大獲全勝
"Beat the pants off him."

532
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,530
他可以去說相聲了
He could be in vaudeville.

533
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,020
康凱特醫生! 康凱特醫生!
"Dr. Kronkheit! Dr. Kronkheit!"

534
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,840
我的脖子有風濕病
"I got rheumatism on the back of my neck."

535
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,650
-真像  -那是什么意思
- That's him to a T. - What's that supposed to mean?

536
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,110
動一下指頭  就是世界末日
Every little sniffle, it's the end of the world.

537
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,400
這才不是我
This is not me at all.

538
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,540
那個買保險的肯定有你的電話
That insurance salesman sure had your number.

539
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,140
耍的他團團轉
Played him like a fiddle.

540
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,650
你家出什么事了
"What happens to your family?

541
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,830
湯普森先生  我認識一個和你一樣的人
Mr. Thompson, I know a fella just like you--"

542
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,900
凡事早想一步肯定沒錯
Nothing wrong with planning ahead.

543
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,790
真正的藍眼娃娃臉
Real blue-eyed baby face, you know?

544
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,950
唱詩班少年那樣
Choirboy type.

545
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,850
沒想到他只想把最貴的賣給你
Wouldn't think all he wants to do is sell you the most expensive

546
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,020
瓊  你能不能給我閉嘴
June, just shut your goddamn trap for once.

547
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,520
行嗎  閉嘴
Okay? Just shut it.

548
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,200
別調侃了  就這樣
Enough with the teasing. That's all.

549
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,470
給我在巴爾默來次約會
Got me a "Round-day-voos" In "Balmer."

550
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,390
別碰我
Get away from me, boy.

551
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,740
別讓我找你麻煩
Don't let me keep you.

552
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,830
又一個小時  把手拿開
Ain't for another hour. Get your hands off me.

553
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,800
-然后繼續玩你的  -住手
- Then play like you playing. - Stop.

554
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,370
就是不舒服
Can't get settled.

555
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,790
他怎么樣
He doin' all right in there?

556
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,590
他累壞了
He get real tired around now,

557
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,570
但是不想躺下
but he don't like to lay down.

558
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,880
發發牢騷
Fussin'.

559
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,320
-老小孩一樣  -什么
- Old man and a baby. - What's that?

560
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,690
老人和小孩一樣
Different and the same.

561
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,440
小孩還有一輩子要走
Baby got their whole life in front of 'em.

562
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,200
而且不會花錢就能啃奶子
Plus he ain't got to pay to suck on no tittie.

563
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,790
這話別說出來
Keep your problems to yourself.

564
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,370
你想打架嗎
You gonna make a move?

565
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,010
你贏了  回頭見
You win. I'll see you browns later.

566
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,110
你這次再喝大了我也不去開車接你
Ain't driving down to fetch you this time you get all lushed.

567
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,590
要玩嗎

568
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,610

你是黑方
You're black.

571
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,000
好吧
All right now.

572
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,350
你是大人物
So you the biggety man?

573
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,450
-怎么講  -叔叔說的
- How that? - Uncle say.

574
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,090
-我有自己的生意  -給我講講你的事
- I do my business. - Tell me all about you.

575
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,260
是嗎
That so?

576
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,410
比如你怎么傷的
Like you blood.

577
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,890
那么
Well...

578
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,340
我們得回去
we go back.

579
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,870
我什么都不怕
I ain't afraid or nothin'.

580
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,820
到你了
Your move.

581
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,050
你來玩一會
Why don't you play a while?

582
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,640
不喜歡我做的菜
Doesn't like my cooking.

583
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,930
口味不一樣而已
From a different time, that all.

584
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,770
是嗎
Is he, though?

585
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,030
我們在做什么
What are we doing?

586
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,480
-等待  -等什么
- Waiting. - For what?

587
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,530
你有家  有個待嫁的女兒
You got a family, a girl getting married.

588
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,040
現在這些對我來說還有什么意義
What that matter to me now?

589
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,770
你只想著退出
You only think you quit.

590
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,110
我難道不知道自己的想法嗎
Don't I know what I feel?

591
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,790
你想那些人死
You want those men dead.

592
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,030
你的敵人  和被你看成是朋友的那個人
The one who's your enemy and the one you called a friend...

593
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,770
不是嗎
don't you?

594
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,660
你不過是個睡在搖籃里的寶貝
You wasn't nothing but a baby in that Storyville crib.

595
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,940
-不是  -是誰救了你
- No. - Who the man that save you?

596
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,050
我告訴過你  是醫生
I told you. The doctor.

597
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,350
那又是誰害死你母親的
And who the man steal your mama life away?

598
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,820
我不知道我的名字
I didn't know my name.

599
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,870
他叫我道特  我就是道特
He called me Daughter, and that's who I am.

600
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,810
我們走吧
Let's leave.

601
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,150
現在就走
Right now.

602
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,100
我們離開這里  再也不回來
Let's run and never look back.

603
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,980
你只要答應就可以
All you gotta do is say it.

604
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,390
叔叔找你
Uncle looking for you.

605
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,220
他很不安心
He real restless.

606
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,780
-你能選擇去哪嗎  -你喜歡哪
- Do you get to choose where? - Well, where would you like?

607
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,700
離這越遠越好
Whatever is farthest from here.

608
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,490
-日本  -稍微近點的
- Japan. - Closer, please.

609
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,750
加利福尼亞
Uh, California.

610
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,500
我們的房子會是什么樣的
What's our house gonna look like?

611
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,040
比你現在的小點
It'll be smaller than the one you have now.

612
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,160
-不  但是不要太小  -我會保證讓你住著舒服的
- No, but not too small. - No, I'll make sure it suits you.

613
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,960
我自己也有錢
I'll have my own money, you know.

614
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,750
你就自己留著需要的時候用吧
You're gonna hold on to that for when you need it.

615
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,340
你想讓我依靠你
You want me depending on you.

616
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,600
我想讓你感覺和現在一樣自由
I want you to feel as free as you do right now.

617
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,130
我們該走了
We should go.

618
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,350
我把車開出來  方便你上車
I'll pull up. It'll be easier to get in.

619
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,190
鑰匙不見了
The key's hiding somewhere.

620
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,060
在這
Here.

621
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,340
菲利普斯
Phillips.

622
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,880
-羅伊  -在
- Roy. - Yeah.

623
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,940
菲利普斯
Phillips.

624
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,170
休森
Hewson.

625
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,110
-你來干什么  -慶祝
- What brings you here? - Celebrating?

626
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,700
剛吃完晚餐
Just having dinner.

627
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,490
-你和你的婊子一起  -這話太過分了
- You and your whore there. - Hey, that's over the line.

628
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,540
我過分
I'm over the line?

629
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,600
我因為你失去了工作
I lost my job because of you,

630
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,210
你這個背后下刀的混蛋
you backstabbing prick.

631
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,530
都十五年了
After 15 years.

632
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,680
-羅伊  別這樣  -我現在還有什么
- Roy, don't. - What do I have now?

633
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,540
我這就讓你感受下生活被毀掉的感覺
I'll show you how it feels to have your life ruined.

634
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,760
-你給我退后  -羅伊  別
- You back off. - Roy, no.

635
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,840
-羅伊  -我要讓你知道失去一切的
- Roy. - I'll show you how it feels to lose everything--

636
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,250
我以為他會
I thought he would--

637
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,700
我以為他有
I thought he had a...

638
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,910
羅伊  我們該走了
Roy, we need to go.

639
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,960
-我們該走了  -我不該開槍的
- We need to go. - I should hang on to that.

640
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,320
去開車  趕緊  快去
You need to drive. Go. Hurry.

641
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,750
上車
Get in.

642
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,550
快點
Hurry.

643
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,440
你被抓住了
You're caught.

644
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,350
別擔心  我們會一起受罰
Don't worry, we'll both go down together.

645
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,260
你覺得剛才是怎么回事
What do you think that was about?

646
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,120
我不會太當回事
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

647
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,800
你父親脾氣就是比較沖
It's always been pretty easy to get your father's goat.

648
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,980
真的嗎
Really?

649
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,420
你跟他提瑪麗·安·諾蘭試試
Just mention Mary Anne Nolan to him.

650
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,610
-那是誰  -八年級的時候愛上的姑娘
- Who's she? - Eighth grade crush.

651
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,950
他給她寫了首詩
He wrote her a poem.

652
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,880
我看到的時候真是樂壞了
Happy day when I found it.

653
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,110
不能怪他擔心
Can't blame him for worrying, though.

654
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,660
你得想想你離開之后會是怎樣
You have to think about what's gonna happen after you're gone.

655
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,550
為了你們全家好
For the sake of all of you.

656
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,440
那個賣保險的
That insurance fella, though--

657
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,960
聽上去很像個騙子
sounds like a real sharpie.

658
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,520
我沒怎么聽全
I didn't hear very much of it.

659
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,990
-你見過他  -打了個照面
- You met him? - Just for a minute.

660
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,800
和你母親說的一樣
Like your mother said?

661
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,870
-什么  -娃娃臉
- What? - Baby face?

662
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,690
算是吧
Yeah, I guess.

663
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,260
以前見過他嗎
Ever see him before?

664
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,180
沒有
No.

665
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,880
你確定
You're sure now?

666
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,760
你和我說的話  威爾  跟誰也別提
Whatever you tell me, Will, it's just between us.

667
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,170
這個我們之前就說過了
That's what we agreed to.

668
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,860
努基伯父  我
Uncle Nucky, I...

669
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,540
該死
Shit.

670
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,020
我什么也沒看到
I don't notice anything.

671
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,980
只是在感受海風
Just taking in the breeze.

672
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,980
姑娘們和我把一切都收拾好了
The girls and I put everything away.

673
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,660
你不用這么做
You didn't have to do that.

674
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,750
看著干凈了我心理舒服
I feel better knowing the place is tidy.

675
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,230
我睡不著
I can't hardly sleep.

676
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,780
這些多余的時間
All this, uh, extra time,

677
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,970
老了之后無事可做的時間
you know, when you get old, you ain't got nothing to do with it.

678
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,970
你說了  該做的都做了
You said done was done.

679
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,800
是啊  可是這不意味著我得喜歡這樣
Yeah, but it don't mean I have to like it.

680
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,720
給孩子們一些活干
Got the boys runnin' some action.

681
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,420
釀點私酒  搞搞賭局
You know, a little moonshining, some numbers--

682
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,250
但是沒多少錢
eh, but it don't amount to much.

683
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,160
你的錢去哪了
Where your money go?

684
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,660
我本來掙的就不多
I didn't make half as much as you think.

685
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,800
準將給我什么我就接什么
I took in what the Commodore let me take in.

686
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
沒多少選擇
I had no choice.

687
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,480
他死了  三年了
He gone now, three year back.

688
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,070
我可不想念他  一點也不想
Man, I don't miss him. I do not miss him.

689
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,270
但是你在和那個叫湯普森的做生意
But you did your business with the Thompson boy, though.

690
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,120
-幫了他不少忙  -是啊
- Help him plenty. - Mm-hmm.

691
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,330
他怎么回報你的
Now how did that buckra pay you back?

692
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,240
我現在該做什么  奧斯卡
What I do now, Oscar?

693
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,910
你待在這  干出一番事業
You stay here, you build something up.

694
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,200
這是你侄子的地方
That's for your nephew.

695
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,510
溫斯頓沒什么大出息
Winston ain't never gonna amount to nothing.

696
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,310
你待在這  趁那個女人沒給你惹上麻煩之前
You stay here, and cut that woman loose

697
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,340
把她趕走
'fore she do you in proper.

698
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,890
她和這事沒關系
She ain't to blame for this.

699
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,510
如果不是她  那就是你
And if she ain't, then you are.

700
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,340
算了  你想怎樣就怎么樣
Well, damn, you do what you want.
