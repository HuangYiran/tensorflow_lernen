{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She'll be coming 'round the mountain in the rain

191
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,574
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You ain't from around here, are you?

192
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,914
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm still working on it.

193
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:56,825
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, what's your name?

194
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Beans. - That's a funny kind of name.

195
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,508
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What can I say? My daddy plumb loved baked beans.

196
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,343
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you're lucky he didn't plumb love asparagus.

197
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,633
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you saying?

198
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,803
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean, I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

199
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,174
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but I'm not sure that a child would appreciate the moniker.

200
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My daddy was a great man, even if he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.

201
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:17,514
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Spicy. - You're eating his ashes!

202
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,059
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You carry his remains?

203
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,445
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, his ashes. He loved to smoke. They never found the body.

204
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,531
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

205
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,616
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What are you implying? - Nothing.

206
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,702
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My daddy was never near that mine shaft.

207
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,372
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He'd been sober for over a month!

208
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,416
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And for you to insinuate that he would abandon his parental responsibilities

209
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:38,458
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}at a delicate time in my personal development is an affront to my sense...

210
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,505
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Miss Beans?

211
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,753
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Miss Beans? Hello?

212

215
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,914
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What... What are you doing? - What are you doing?

216
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:16,871
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What am I doing? - You're cuddling me.

217
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You were frozen. - I was not.

218
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, you were. You stopped talking.

219

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a defence mechanism. Actually, lots of lizards have it.

220
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're making that up.

221
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,095
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, you gonna die out here, or you want a ride into town?

222
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:32,139
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please. Thank you. Sorry.

223
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,971
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Today's Wednesday. Wednesday's when we all get to it.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's my stage name, my pen name, my avatar.

227
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,106
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I had a pseudonym once, but I had it legally changed.

228
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:49,192
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And so the stranger, seeking companionship,

229
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,624
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}finds the woman, much like the sirens of ancient times

230

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You eat him? - That's what I said!

285

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hell, I seen things make a grown man lose control of his glandular functions!

286
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:13,122
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You spend three days in a horse carcass, living off your own juices.

287
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,086
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.

288
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:23,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Had a few extra aces in this deck, gents. Just the way I like it.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You might say I'm from everywhere there's trouble brewing

291
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and hell waiting to be raised.

292
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:36,349
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You might say I'm what hell's already raised up.

293
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,193
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Name's

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rango.

296
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:48,069
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you the fella that killed them Jenkins brothers?

297
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Killed them with one bullet.

298
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,409
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't get no deader.

299
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,535
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All seven of them?

300
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,082
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right.

301
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,416
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All seven of them.

302
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:04,628
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Exactly how you do that, Mr Rango?

303
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,015
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, I'm glad you asked me that.

304
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:13,057
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I will be happy to tell you how. But you're all gonna have to listen up!

305
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:16,562
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because this is where it gets

306
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,984
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}complicated.

307
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:23,984
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That'll close out your account, Mrs Oats, two gulps and a swig.

308
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:27,532
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left of your college education!

309
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't rightly have no other choice, Beans.

310
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:36,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Times being so hard, we just can't give no more credit.

311
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But this here is a bank. This is where you keep the water.

312
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:47,096
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans, you've been like a niece to me ever since your daddy

313
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:52,176
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

314
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:56,808
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've tried to protect you and others from certain realities.

315
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,899
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But that... Well...

316
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:01,194
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Mr Merrimack? - Realities are bearing down.

317
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:02,816
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr Merrimack!

318

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

319
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:08,986
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans, I need to show you something.

320
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:20,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- That's all that's left? - And this here is the reserve!

321
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,924
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know if you've noticed,

322
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:25,503
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but folks just ain't making deposits on a Wednesday no more!

323
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:29,054
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr Merrimack, if I don't get some water, I'm gonna lose my ranch

324
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:31,509
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and you're telling me that's all that's left in the whole town?

325
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:34,765
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now that just don't make no sense. Now, listen.

326
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:38,848
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Someone is dumping water in the desert.

327
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,274
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I seen it with my own eyes.

328
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Water in the desert?

329
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:49,119
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Was this during one of your special times?

330
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:50,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No.

331
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:54,626
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, we can all dream, but this is the reality.

332
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:58,335
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why do you think so many people are selling out? They just can't make it.

333
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:00,872
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, what am I supposed to do?

334
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,012
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

335
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:07,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I hear he's been helping people out in this time of crisis.

336
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,469
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Mayor?

337
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He may be our only hope.

338
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:14,312
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back towards number three,

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and that's when the roof caved in,

340
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,975
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}igniting the thermos of pure grain alcohol

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold on, there. That's only six. What happened to number seven?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Things are going to be different around here now that Rango's in town.

377
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:53,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Got some new rules! I want my shoes shined every morning,

378
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,166
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

379
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,501
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whatever you do, don't look me in the eye.

380
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,038
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stay out of my peripheral vision!

381
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- It's Rango. - What's he up to?

382
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He ain't afraid of nobody. He's telling that bird what's for!

383
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And when you see me coming, stand aside.

384
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,351
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I take large steps and I don't want none of you hayseeds

385
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:13,146
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

386
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,809
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course, there is no need for violence,

387
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}as long as we stick together, work as a team.

388
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:24,357
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So I want you all to come outside now and line up single file

389
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,902
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}while I take a brief intermission!

390
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,621
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's he doing now?

391
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think it's a number two.

392
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:55,806
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Never mind.

393
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,456
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Take a look-see over here!

394
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:19,788
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, look at him now!

395
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:21,751
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's chasing after that hawk!

396
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,343
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Give him hell, Rango!

397
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:20,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Did you see that? - He killed that thing!

398
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:21,794
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you think, Doc?

399
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,263
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This hawk is dead!

400
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,338
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shoot, I say we cook that right up.

401
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,135
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He did it with one bullet!

402
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just like he said!

403
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,603
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's about time we had a hero around here.

404
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,937
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One who ain't in a pine box.

405
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think it's time he met the Mayor.

406
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You hear that, Rango? You're going to meet the Mayor!

407
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,945
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's hear it for Rango!

408
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:50,736
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And so the stranger basks

409
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:54,207
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}in the adulation of his new friends,

410
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:59,496
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception.

411
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:01,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When is he going to die?

412
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,792
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Soon, compadre. Soon.

413
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:22,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My land is not for sale!

414
00:35:23,574 --> 00:35:26,065
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I came here to save my land, not sell it!

415
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:29,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sure there's something reasonable we can work out if you just talk to him!

416
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,992
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

417
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,376
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Mayor will see you now.

418
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:44,134
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Water, Mr Rango, water.

419
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:47,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.

420
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:52,518
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But with water there's life.

421
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:59,518
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at them, so desperate to live, they'll follow it anywhere.

422
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:02,318
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's the immutable law of the desert.

423
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:08,405
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Control the water and you control everything.

424
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:12,956
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I don't have to tell you that being a true man of the West, as you are.

425
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:17,456
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

426
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:19,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is from my private stock.

427
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:23,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Vintage rainwater from the Great Deluge.

428
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,634
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not Noah's deluge. Good heavens, I'm not that old.

429
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I guess power has its privileges.

430
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:34,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You make a good point, son.

431
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,858
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But with privilege comes responsibility.

432
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,447
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hell, I was mayor here before there was a Dirt!

433
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:46,859
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I may be just a sentimental old turtle

434
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:51,952
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but I think there's a future for this town. And I hope you'll be part of it.

435
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,582
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- To Dirt! - To Dirt.

436
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:03,132
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You see them, Mr Rango? All my friends and neighbours?

437
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:07,464
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a hard life here. Very hard.

438
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:12,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you know how they make it through each and every day?

439
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:13,141
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They believe.

440
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They believe it's going to be better.

441
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They believe that the water will come.

442
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,865
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They believe against all odds and all evidence

443
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,023
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that tomorrow will be better than today.

444
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}People have to believe in something.

445
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,659
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right now, they believe in you.

446
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,132
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pick it up, Mr Rango. Your destiny awaits.

447
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,052
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}People have to believe in something.

448
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's almost noon. Is everything ready?

449
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,609
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. But he might be a problem.

450
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:02,105
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's not a problem, William. He's a solution.

451
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,735
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It just don't make no sense.

452
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This whole town is drying up,

453
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,069
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and the Mayor is the only one who don't seem to be affected.

454
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,164
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Doesn't that make you just a wee bit suspicious?

455
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,454
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And what about that water I saw out in the desert?

456
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:20,917
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right! No need to incite anxiety. I'll inquire about the Mayor.

457
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,716
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But if you really feel there's some conspiracy occurring,

458
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff.

459
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:32,227
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is going to be good. Hey! Watch that needle there.

460
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,765
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not too tight. I want to leave room for some pucker!

461
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:34,893
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's good.

462
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,019
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, easy there, tiger.

463
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:38,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- A little up and back? - I don't think so.

464
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,142
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Have you got French cuffs with that?

465
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,559
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me, Sheriff Rango. I want to talk to you.

466
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,156
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Beans, what do you think of the new duds?

467
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:45,239
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got a 10-gallon hat marked down from 15.

468
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- That's nice. - Have you met Angelique?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So which way do you think they went?

657
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:22,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You want to sniff the air or commune with a buffalo or something?

658
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,508
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, you're good.

659
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:32,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm depending on you, Spoons.

660
00:50:32,938 --> 00:50:35,559
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got a little tobaccy in the beard there.

661
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:38,608
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Always good to have a medical man along, Doc.

662
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Reptiles got to stick together, right, my brother?

663
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:42,817
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm an amphibian.

664
00:50:42,948 --> 00:50:44,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ain't no shame in that.

665
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You sure you're fit for duty there, soldier?

666
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:53,916
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you got a little something in your eye there.

667
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,459
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir. It's hereditary.

668
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:02,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I'm glad to hear it's not contagious.

669
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:06,712
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute! A posse ain't no place for a...

670
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:08,796
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Never mind.

671
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,843
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold on there, little sister.

672
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:13,647
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Someone's gonna have to look after the town while I'm gone.

673
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:16,899
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can I gut-shoot someone?

674
00:51:18,277 --> 00:51:20,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's put a pin in that.

675
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:23,739
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff, you're going to bring that water back, aren't you?

676
00:51:24,658 --> 00:51:26,117
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Count on it, little sister.

677
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,497
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Which way do we go, Sheriff? - There's tunnels everywhere.

678
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,167
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whole town's perforated with them.

679
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:37,793
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He got more holes in him than even a painted lady on a porcupine.

680
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:40,834
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

681
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,211
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not what I expected.

682
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:46,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How'd them fellers find the bank, anyway?

683
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:49,174
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, if we can just stay on task here.

684
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff! Over here!

685
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Would you look at that? - Like seeing the face of God.

686
00:51:58,694 --> 00:51:59,892
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Amen, brother.

687
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,566
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I remember when it used to flow every Wednesday.

688
00:52:02,698 --> 00:52:04,655
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Those were the halcyon days.

689
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,554
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Must be a reason she quit on us.

690
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:10,372
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whatever the reason, something is controlling this here water.

691
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:11,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you say, Sheriff?

692
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,789
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Clearly, the robbers came from this direction.

693
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:19,293
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I say we track this pipe back to its hydraulic origin

694
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:21,879
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and apprehend the culprits behind this aquatic conundrum.

695
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,298
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What'd he say? - I think he said follow the pipe.

696
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:26,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- He said follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

697
00:52:31,394 --> 00:52:33,268
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sure is humid down here.

698
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:36,398
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's like the big mud piles.

699
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:38,233
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I had a goitre removed once.

700
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looked like Tony Bennett stepping out of the shower.

701
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:43,363
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I put that on a tortilla.

702
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:59,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whatever you do, do not look down.

703
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:05,511
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What is this place? - It's an aquifer.

704
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:08,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's an aquifer?

705
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:10,974
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, it's for aqua.

706
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, it's empty now.

707
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,579
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a big one.

708
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:40,037
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- It's the end of the line. - Don't go no further.

709
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:43,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now that there is a path. It's got to be connected to something.

710
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:46,627
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You talk too much. Why don't you put a cork in it?

711
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why don't you put a cork... Tell you where the sun don't shine.

712
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your mama did. I'll cook her right up.

713
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,305
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You two just don't get it, do you?

714
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:56,055
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Someone or something is messing with our hydration

715
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and that pipe has got something to do with it.

716
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,026
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I thought we was following bank robbers!

717
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,395
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

718
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,571
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna shift the features on your face if you don't shut up!

719
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,731
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go ahead and try!

720
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:11,081
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling. You're affecting my cogitation.

721
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,455
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.

722
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,256
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sure enough.

723
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:25,595
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Smart thinking there, feller.

724
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Start climbing. - Get your foot out of my face!

725
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,011
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not bad, huh, Beans?

726
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,515
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You keep thinking like that, your hat's gonna catch on fire.

727
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,053
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you know, you get on a roll, you just...

728
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,221
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hot, hot! Burn.

729
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:51,996
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Poor things. All they wanted was a little water.

730
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:55,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.

731
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Hey, look what I found! - What you got there?

732
00:54:57,463 --> 00:55:00,334
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I saw that first! - Hey, that's mine!

733
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:02,009
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Give me that!

734
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:04,092
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's empty anyway.

735
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,631
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I knew that.

736
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,009
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where'd you find that?

737
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,927
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!

738
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,307
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's Mr Merrimack from the bank.

739
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,816
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's he doing here?

740
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:18,436
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Everybody stand back. - All right, let me see.

741
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,024
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looks like them varmints shot him in the back.

742
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:25,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, this man wasn't shot. He was drowned!

743
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Drowned? - In the middle of the desert?

744
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:29,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What a way to go.

745
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:35,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

746
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,546
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's interesting. The ground's still wet.

747
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:44,755
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I suppose we should bury him.

748
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:46,133
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.

00:55:46,306 --> 00:55:47,551
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Circle of life!

750
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sherriff.

751
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:52,221
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will you say a few words?

752
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,853
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah.

753
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dearly beloved.

754

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We are gathered here today to honour this man.

755
00:56:04,116 --> 00:56:05,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr Merrimack,

756
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:07,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you have the right to remain silent.

757
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:09,695
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Speak now or forever hold your peace.

758
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,826
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Amen.

759
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:12,161
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Amen. - Amen.

760
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:15,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?

761
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:21,843
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I see you're consulting with the spirits.

762
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:24,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I'm moulting. Means I'm ready to mate.

763
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:28,217
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll keep that in mind.

764
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,013
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Cactus fruit.

765
00:56:30,143 --> 00:56:32,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.

766
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:34,765
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I believe your people use it as seasoning

767
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:36,309
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}when preparing your native dishes.

768
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:38,233
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Also natural laxative.

769
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:40,976
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pick up trail.

770
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:44,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Three men heading west. One blind, one with

771
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:48,574
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

772
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:51,954
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What did he say? - They're riding sidesaddle.

773
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,458
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- We're whispering. - What'd he say?

774
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:54,663
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Someone's got a bad valve.

775
00:56:54,794 --> 00:56:57,711
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, which one of you fellers needs a check-up?

776
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,794
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Awkward.

777
00:57:01,175 --> 00:57:04,426
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What exactly are we going to do now?

778
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:07,422
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now we ride!

779
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:15,977
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That means we're riding now! This moment.

780
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,272
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Marshmallows remind me of going camping with my daddy.

781
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:03,526
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I could eat them all night long.

782
00:58:05,365 --> 00:58:08,532
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course he did make me cough them back up again for breakfast.

783
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:13,365
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one time, I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

784
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:17,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That ain't nothing. I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

785
00:58:18,337 --> 00:58:20,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They started looking at me weird.

786
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:23,631
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I remember them. They was quite friendly.

787
00:58:23,759 --> 00:58:27,259
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter once.

788
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:32,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You might want to get that looked at.

789
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:36,186
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pass the beans, Beans.

790
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:37,974
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Sheriff? - No, thanks.

791
00:58:38,107 --> 00:58:42,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr Rango? Can you tell us about the Spirit of the West?

792
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:46,406
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Yeah, tell us about that. - Is it true what they say?

793
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:50,151
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, the Spirit of the West!

794
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:52,659
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The eternally unattainable ideal.

795
00:58:53,123 --> 00:58:55,697
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They say he rides in an alabaster carriage

796
00:58:55,834 --> 00:58:57,376
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}with golden guardians to protect him.

797
00:58:58,545 --> 00:59:01,416
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But he only appears to those who have undertaken an epic quest!

798
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:03,591
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And have made it

799
00:59:03,968 --> 00:59:05,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}to the other side.

800
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:11,464
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The other side of what?

801
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:13,518
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a metaphor.

802
00:59:13,644 --> 00:59:14,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My eye!

803
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:16,265
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's gonna heal right up.

804
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:20,347
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff? What are you going to do about Rattlesnake Jake?

805
00:59:20,944 --> 00:59:21,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What? Where?

806
00:59:23,738 --> 00:59:27,653
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sorry about that. Word is you come against him once or twice.

807
00:59:28,743 --> 00:59:30,024
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

808
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:32,119
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jake. You mean my brother.

809
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:34,074
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Your brother? - That's what I said!

810
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:37,455
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

811
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, Momma had an active social life.

812
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:42,878
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did he ever bite you?

813
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:46,377
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sure enough did. Look at that baby. Go ahead, you can touch it.

814
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:50,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's interesting. That there's a belly button.

815
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:52,052
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.

816
00:59:52,185 --> 00:59:54,058
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Put some in my coffee just to give it a little tang.

817
00:59:54,187 --> 00:59:56,096
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is it true he's only scared of them hawks?

818
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,813
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Them's what we call his natural predator.

819
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:04,731
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All this talk of that serpentine devil is putting my quills on edge!

820
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:06,822
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

821
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't you all worry about a thing. Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

822
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:12,161
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and return to a hero's welcome.

823
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:15,823
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Friends, before we bunk down

824
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:18,367
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'd like us all to join hands for a moment,

825
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:21,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}say a few words to the Spirit of the West.

826
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,918
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a good idea.

827
01:00:25,094 --> 01:00:28,048
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ain't always spoken rightly to you, Spirit of the West.

828
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:34,059
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But tonight I want to thank you for bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

829
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:36,729
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a hard life we got.

830
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:39,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sometimes I don't know how we're gonna make it.

831
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:43,651
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But somehow, Sheriff Rango makes me think we will.

832
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:47,533
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We needed a brave man and you sent us one.

833
01:00:48,702 --> 01:00:51,703
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nice to have someone to believe in again.

834
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,413
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

835
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,245
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Amen. - Amen.

836
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,911
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just checking.

837
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:37,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- It's a little cold tonight. - Thank you.

838
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:42,584
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You ever feel like those things are looking at you?

839
01:01:42,758 --> 01:01:44,418
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a Spanish dagger.

840
01:01:44,552 --> 01:01:47,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But around here, we just call them the Walking Cactus.

841
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:48,503
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Walking?

842
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,471
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's an old legend they actually walk across the desert to find water.

843
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:56,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late watching them, to see if they'd move.

844
01:01:56,481 --> 01:02:00,526
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I thought if I could follow them, they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

845
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:04,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Someplace with enough water for everyone.

846
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:09,694
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Night after night, I watched them. I never saw them move.

847
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But you're still watching.

848
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,827
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who doesn't want to find someplace wonderful?

849
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:18,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We'll find the water, Beans. I promise you.

850
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:24,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's such a lonely sound.

851
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:27,218
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You ever get lonely?

852
01:02:27,346 --> 01:02:28,675
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sometimes.

853
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:33,302
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer and everyone likes you so much.

854
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:36,807
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I never made friends easy like that. - No?

855
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:40,063
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, we're pretty isolated out there on the ranch,

856
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:42,862
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}sort of like being sealed up in a little box.

857
01:02:42,987 --> 01:02:46,357
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't really see a lot of folks.

858
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:48,698
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wouldn't know what that's like.

859
01:02:49,536 --> 01:02:52,074
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There someone special in your life, Rango?

860
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:55,535
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There used to be. But she couldn't keep her head.

861
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:57,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Besides, my life's too dangerous for that kind of thing.

862
01:02:57,795 --> 01:03:00,831
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, it's an awful solitary existence out there on the prairie.

863
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:03,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

864
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:06,125
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans?

865
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:09,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans?

866
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:30,282
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna whup you like a red-headed stepchild!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Choleric varmints, ain't they?

868
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,748
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's the water.

871
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:46,715
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have a plan, and each and every one of you has a part to play.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do I do?

873
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,924
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Spoons, you got the most important job of all.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I suggest we take evasive action!

938
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:13,301
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I suggest you shut up and shoot!

939
01:09:13,436 --> 01:09:15,974
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What happened to the Sheriff? - He had a previous engagement!

940
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:18,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

941
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:28,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What was that? Go check it out!

942
01:09:29,411 --> 01:09:31,071
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is it? Is there a problem?

943
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,916
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You could call it that.

944
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:24,457
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Headache.

945
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,255
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is that all you got?

946
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

947
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,033
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Eat lead!

948
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here, hold these.

949
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,854
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get your hands off me!

950
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:23,356
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry.

951
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jump!

952
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,725
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's impossible.

953
01:11:58,233 --> 01:12:01,103
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It can't be. It's empty.

954
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:02,896
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's no water!

955
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:06,445
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No water? Then what the hell we been fighting for?

956
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:10,786
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, you have defiled and desecrated the very sustenance of our livelihood!

957
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:13,486
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think that there fella in the purty dress is the Sheriff.

958
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:16,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's the same fellow what give us a prospecting permit?

959
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:19,128
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- A what? - Irrelevant! Obfuscation.

960
01:12:19,254 --> 01:12:21,212
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery

961
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,333
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and the murder of our beloved financial advisor

962
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:26,919
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Johannes Merrimack the Third, AKA, Fluffy Joe.

963
01:12:27,054 --> 01:12:28,596
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

964
01:12:28,723 --> 01:12:31,048
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We done tunnelled into that vault, but there weren't nothing in it.

965
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,093
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Somebody done robbed that bank before we robbed it.

966
01:12:33,227 --> 01:12:34,935
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then where'd you get this here jug?

967
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's what I been trying to tell you, Pappy.

968
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:38,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I found it in the desert.

969
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:41,644
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then why in tarnation did you bring it here?

970
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:45,692
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold on! You're saying this here jug was empty when you found it?

971
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,022
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right.

972
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:48,439
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't believe a word of it.

973
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:50,071
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Let's hang them, Sheriff! - String them up!

974
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:51,614
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who'd dump water in the desert?

975
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:53,789
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wouldn't be the first time.

976
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a puzzle! It's like a big old mammogram!

977
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,038
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's going on, Sheriff?

978
01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:00,499
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know.

979
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:04,629
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I'm going to strip away this mystery and expose its private parts.

980
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,967
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You and your kin are coming with me.

981
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:12,715
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're coming!

982
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:14,512
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here they come!

983
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:18,221
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looks like they got them robbers.

984
01:13:40,798 --> 01:13:42,173
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where's the water?

985
01:13:45,261 --> 01:13:47,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There weren't no water.

986
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:03,021
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where is he going?

987
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:06,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's going to see the Mayor.

988
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:10,701
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's got to be pleased with that.

989
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:12,572
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a good one, boss!

990
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's interesting.

991
01:14:23,634 --> 01:14:26,469
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I do apologise for the shoes, Mr Rango,

992
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,881
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but there's a certain protocol to this game, you understand.

993
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:32,304
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

994
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:35,352
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that's good, 'cause you got a few questions to answer

995
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I've got my own protocol.

996
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:44,649
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But why would anyone dump water in the blooming desert?

997
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:48,779
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It does seem a bit na'ive, taking the word of admitted bank robbers.

998
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:52,493
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Besides, once they hang, your job is done.

999
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:54,081
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Bravo! - Job well done.

1000
01:14:54,207 --> 01:14:57,125
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But what if somebody did rob the bank before they got there?

1001
01:14:57,252 --> 01:14:59,375
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And who would do that, Mr Rango?

1002
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:01,711
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was hoping you could tell me.

1003
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,795
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That sounds marginally near to an accusation.

1004
01:15:04,927 --> 01:15:06,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Take it any way you like.

1005
01:15:12,268 --> 01:15:15,851
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Something you said keeps rattling around in my frontal lobe.

1006
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,095
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's that?

1007
01:15:17,815 --> 01:15:21,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"Control the water and you control everything."

1008
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:24,193
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come now, Mr Rango.

1009
01:15:24,322 --> 01:15:27,193
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You attribute divine power to me.

1010
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:30,445
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How on earth could I possibly control the water?

1011
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:36,082
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You've obviously mastered this game.

1012
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:39,626
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I've been playing it for many years, sir.

1013
01:15:39,755 --> 01:15:42,875
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was here before the highway split this great valley.

1014
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:45,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I watched the march of progress,

1015
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:48,217
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I learned a thing or two.

1016
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:51,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Perhaps it's time you started to take the long view,

1017
01:15:52,018 --> 01:15:55,802
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}begin to appreciate the broad sweep of history.

1018
01:15:56,522 --> 01:15:57,981
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look out there, son.

1019
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:01,309
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can almost see time passing.

1020
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:06,649
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you building out here?

1021
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,069
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The future, Mr Rango, the future.

1022
01:16:10,203 --> 01:16:13,869
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One day soon, all this is going to fade into myth,

1023
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:16,786
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the frontier town, the lawman, the gunslinger.

1024
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:19,291
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's just no place for them any more.

1025
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:22,672
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- We're civilised now. - That's right, civilised.

1026
01:16:23,551 --> 01:16:25,128
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's what the future holds.

1027
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:28,594
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.

1028
01:16:29,015 --> 01:16:32,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is that what happened to Mr Merrimack? Did he get left behind?

1029
01:16:32,977 --> 01:16:37,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Careful, Mr Rango. You seem to forget you're just one little lizard.

1030
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:41,773
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You seem to forget I'm the law around these parts.

1031

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}he's actually starting to believe it.

1033
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:52,569
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

1034
01:16:52,706 --> 01:16:55,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

1035

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He never leaves without taking a blooming soul.

1036
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,118
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do it!

1037

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now be still. You gotta look presentable to meet your maker.

1038
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:27,024
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Death has arrived

1039

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How will the hero survive?

1040
01:17:39,672 --> 01:17:42,791
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Mayor has bought up all the land in the valley,

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

1042
01:17:44,885 --> 01:17:48,669
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That just don't make no sense. Without water, that land is useless.

1043
01:17:48,806 --> 01:17:51,593
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Unless he controls the water.

1044
01:17:51,726 --> 01:17:53,553
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Like a monkey's bladder!

1045
01:17:53,686 --> 01:17:55,928
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then he could bring it back once he's bought up all the land.

1046
01:17:56,064 --> 01:17:57,143
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But how does he control the water?

1047
01:17:59,484 --> 01:18:02,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you gotta spend some time and train them.

1048
01:18:02,737 --> 01:18:05,774
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}'Cause you know monkeys, when they do go, you rub their nose in it.

1049
01:18:06,032 --> 01:18:07,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff, we got a problem.

1050
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:18,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold on, Beans. That won't be necessary.

1051
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:24,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Hang him till his head turns blue! - Give us them robbers!

1052
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:27,376
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold on! Calm down, everyone! Let me talk!

1053
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:29,755
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Nail them to the courthouse! - Now, calm down, everybody.

1054
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:32,512
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get them out here so we can cut off their giblets!

1055
01:18:33,144 --> 01:18:34,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You, too, Spoons?

1056
01:18:34,854 --> 01:18:38,188
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They done taken that water. They taken everything we got!

1057
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:41,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No one's stringing anyone up. Not while I'm sheriff.

1058
01:18:41,402 --> 01:18:42,601
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But this is all his fault!

1059
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:45,063
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You said you's gonna bring the water back.

1060
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,689
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's just, we got no hope without that water.

1061
01:18:47,826 --> 01:18:49,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We got nothing left to believe in.

1062
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:51,906
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You see that sign up there?

1063
01:18:52,706 --> 01:18:54,864
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

1064
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,325
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you can believe that there's law and order in this town.

1065
01:18:57,461 --> 01:19:01,506
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But without law and order, ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

1066
01:19:01,632 --> 01:19:04,799
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Starts out slow, like a fungus.

1067
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:07,548
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Somebody says a cross word. Accusations start flying.

1068
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,467
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Neighbour turns on neighbour. Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

1069
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,975
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And then dogs and cats are getting together

1070
01:19:12,101 --> 01:19:14,723
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}to create all sorts of unnatural mutant aberrations!

1071
01:19:15,772 --> 01:19:19,307
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, you want something to believe in, Spoons?

1072
01:19:19,776 --> 01:19:20,974
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Believe in me.

1073

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}For as long as it hangs there, we got hope.

1075
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:56,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hello, brother.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Isn't that right?

1083
01:20:36,356 --> 01:20:39,522
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Seems these folks trust you.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why don't you just pull your gun and shoot me?

1090

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But, of course, you won't need all these.

1123
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,776
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't even know who I am.

1124
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,854
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They used to call you the Man with No Name.

1125
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,109
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}These days they got a name for just about everything.

1126
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,493
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Doesn't matter what they call you. It's the deeds make the man.

1127
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:39,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, but my deeds just made things worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

1128
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:43,372
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My friends believed in me, but they need some kind of hero.

1129
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,169
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then be a hero.

1130
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:49,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. No, no, you don't understand. I'm not even supposed to be here.

1131
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:53,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right. You came a long way to find something that isn't out here.

1132
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:57,273
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't you see? It's not about you.

1133
01:27:58,316 --> 01:27:59,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's about them.

1134
01:28:02,821 --> 01:28:04,196
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I can't go back.

1135
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:06,648
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't know that you got a choice, son.

1136
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:13,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No man can walk out on his own story.

1137
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,469
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So you made it.

1138
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:32,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right, amigo. The other side of the road.

1139
01:28:35,229 --> 01:28:37,471
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did you just see that?

1140
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:40,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We each see what we need to see.

1141
01:28:41,778 --> 01:28:43,735
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beautiful, isn't it?

1142
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:56,872
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1143
01:28:58,045 --> 01:28:59,373
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is.

1144
01:29:00,005 --> 01:29:03,754
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come, my friend. I want to show you something.

1145
01:29:06,804 --> 01:29:12,095
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Many years ago, this entire valley was covered in agua.

1146
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:16,141
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now only one question remains.

1147
01:29:17,398 --> 01:29:18,893
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where did it go?

1148
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:55,976
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They follow the water.

1149
01:29:56,105 --> 01:29:59,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They follow the water! Come on!

1150
01:30:34,103 --> 01:30:38,646
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That just don't make no sense. Without water, that land is useless.

1151
01:30:39,442 --> 01:30:41,351
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you building out here?

1152
01:30:41,486 --> 01:30:43,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The future, Mr Rango.

1153
01:30:43,488 --> 01:30:47,984
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.

1154
01:30:50,454 --> 01:30:53,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was here before the highway split this great valley.

1155
01:30:56,376 --> 01:30:58,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I watched the march of progress

1156
01:30:59,088 --> 01:31:01,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I learned a thing or two.

1157
01:31:06,679 --> 01:31:08,802
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Control the water

1158
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:11,303
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and you control everything.

1159
01:31:18,191 --> 01:31:20,397
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come now, Mr Rango.

1160
01:31:20,527 --> 01:31:22,318
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You attribute divine power to me.

1161
01:31:22,445 --> 01:31:24,983
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How on earth could I possibly control the water?

1162
01:32:01,945 --> 01:32:03,902
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What now, amigo?

1163
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,581
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No man can walk out on his own story.

1164
01:32:16,168 --> 01:32:17,579
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm going back.

1165
01:32:19,088 --> 01:32:20,416
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But why?

1166
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:23,547
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because that's who I am.

1167
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:40,357
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got a lot of nerve showing up here, lawman. What is it you want?

1168
01:32:41,444 --> 01:32:45,063
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your pappy and them boys are about to hang for something they didn't do.

1169
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:48,157
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I've got a plan.

1170
01:33:16,314 --> 01:33:19,101
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I appreciate how difficult this is for you, Beans.

1171
01:33:19,275 --> 01:33:22,193
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But you're making a practical decision.

1172
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,025
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Decisions, decisions.

1173
01:33:25,156 --> 01:33:28,276
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's no need for any more suffering.

1174
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:38,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your family's ranch is nothing but a wasteland now.

1175
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:43,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sign the deed and relieve yourself of your father's burden.

1176
01:33:45,678 --> 01:33:48,465
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My daddy was not a burden!

1177
01:33:48,597 --> 01:33:50,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Keep your blood money and I'll keep my land!

1178
01:33:57,148 --> 01:34:00,268
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do what he says or, by all the fires of the black pit,

1179
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:03,771
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes out of your skull!

1180
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:06,731
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, hold on, Jake. There's no need to...

1181
01:34:06,867 --> 01:34:09,155
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let me do my job! You brought me in.

1182
01:34:09,286 --> 01:34:11,824
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now we're gonna play this thing out to the end!

1183
01:34:12,664 --> 01:34:15,072
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sign the damn paper, woman!

1184
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:17,083
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go to hell!

1185
01:34:17,336 --> 01:34:19,625
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where do you think I come from?

1186
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:22,544
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look into my eyes.

1187
01:34:22,675 --> 01:34:25,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I want to see you die.

1188
01:34:30,141 --> 01:34:31,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jake!

1189
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:36,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm calling you out!

1190
01:34:38,983 --> 01:34:40,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jake!

1191
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:45,196
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This day just got a little more interesting.

1192
01:35:12,477 --> 01:35:13,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Put her down.

1193
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:17,352
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Or what, little man? You going to kill me?

1194
01:35:17,482 --> 01:35:19,309
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's just about the size of it.

1195
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Get your filthy paws off me! - Shut your gob!

1196
01:35:24,781 --> 01:35:27,901
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, Sheriff, make your move.

1197
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:01,673
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, amigos!

1198
01:37:06,262 --> 01:37:08,883
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Heave! Heave! - Heave! Heave!

1199
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,195
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That was a bad idea.

1200
01:37:33,624 --> 01:37:34,619
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thirsty, brother?

1201
01:37:38,295 --> 01:37:40,371
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here it comes!

1202
01:37:42,216 --> 01:37:43,212
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. No!

1203
01:37:47,638 --> 01:37:48,836
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a miracle!

1204
01:37:49,015 --> 01:37:50,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look out!

1205
01:37:57,523 --> 01:37:59,184
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Lookee there! - What is that?

1206
01:38:01,152 --> 01:38:02,528
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's our salvation, Pa!

1207
01:38:02,654 --> 01:38:05,738
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!

1208
01:38:16,001 --> 01:38:20,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna blow so many holes in you, your guts'll be leaking lead!

1209
01:38:20,172 --> 01:38:22,877
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, then it's a good thing I brought some backup.

1210
01:38:34,187 --> 01:38:35,218
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

1211
01:38:39,025 --> 01:38:40,852
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ain't no hawk.

1212
01:38:40,985 --> 01:38:43,393
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ain't nothing but bats!

1213
01:38:45,615 --> 01:38:49,827
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stick to the plan, boys! Let's bleed that devil dry!

1214
01:39:01,298 --> 01:39:03,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It only takes one bullet.

1215
01:39:03,551 --> 01:39:05,627
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You ain't got the nerve.

1216
01:39:06,846 --> 01:39:08,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Try me.

1217
01:39:12,643 --> 01:39:14,221
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, Mr Rango.

1218
01:39:14,937 --> 01:39:16,597
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Aren't you forgetting something?

1219
01:39:21,903 --> 01:39:23,812
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

1220
01:39:26,741 --> 01:39:28,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, Mr Rango.

1221
01:39:40,673 --> 01:39:42,914
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans! Hold on. Don't worry, I got a plan.

1222
01:39:43,926 --> 01:39:46,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Help!

1223
01:39:46,137 --> 01:39:48,425
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Open the door!

1224
01:39:49,098 --> 01:39:50,557
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, plan B.

1225
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:52,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans, you're mumbling.

1226
01:39:53,436 --> 01:39:57,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All my problems taken care of except for one.

1227
01:39:58,274 --> 01:39:59,353
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a new West, Jake.

1228
01:39:59,484 --> 01:40:03,813
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's no room for gunslingers any more. We're businessmen now.

1229
01:40:03,947 --> 01:40:05,655
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, we got new hats.

1230
01:40:05,782 --> 01:40:09,365
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where I come from, we call this improvisation.

1231
01:40:10,787 --> 01:40:12,495
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You came back.

1232
01:40:20,756 --> 01:40:21,919
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What was that?

1233
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,587
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No need to panic, but I think you just swallowed plan B.

1234
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,839
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

1235
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:28,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, panic time.

1236
01:40:29,098 --> 01:40:31,969
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You and the Sheriff are more alike than you think.

1237
01:40:32,143 --> 01:40:33,934
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're nothing but legends.

1238
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:37,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed.

1239
01:40:41,027 --> 01:40:43,601
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

1240
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:47,651
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How fitting.

1241
01:41:21,986 --> 01:41:24,109
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,

1242
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:28,367
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}we can reach a mutually beneficial solution to our current situation.

1243
01:41:28,493 --> 01:41:30,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You better take it up with him.

1244
01:41:42,007 --> 01:41:43,715
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One bullet.

1245
01:41:45,177 --> 01:41:47,466
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I tip my hat to you,

1246
01:41:47,638 --> 01:41:50,473
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}one legend to another.

1247
01:41:52,351 --> 01:41:54,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What was that you said?

1248
01:41:54,645 --> 01:41:59,308
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed."

1249
01:41:59,526 --> 01:42:01,602
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, Jake! No!

1250
01:42:13,999 --> 01:42:15,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rango!

1251
01:42:16,794 --> 01:42:20,578
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You brought the water back, just like you promised.

1252
01:42:20,714 --> 01:42:22,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You really are a hero.

1253
01:42:23,676 --> 01:42:26,796
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, the thing about heroes is, whenever you...

1254
01:42:26,929 --> 01:42:28,673
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't spoil it.

1255
01:42:28,806 --> 01:42:30,004
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right.

1256
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:33,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I don't know about you all, but I could sure go for a dip.

1257
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And so the lizard completes his journey

1258
01:42:40,443 --> 01:42:44,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}from humble beginnings to the legend we sing of today.

1259
01:42:44,572 --> 01:42:49,235
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And although he is certain to die, perhaps from a household accident,

1260
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:52,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}which account for 65o/o of all unnatural deaths,

1261
01:42:52,497 --> 01:42:55,913
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the people of the village will honour his memory

1262
01:42:56,084 --> 01:42:59,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}even as they abandon their dignity.

1263
01:43:06,846 --> 01:43:09,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I'm going in. - How about a cold one, there?

1264
01:43:09,307 --> 01:43:11,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Water ain't money. Money is money.

1265
01:43:11,434 --> 01:43:13,473
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I ain't got no...

1266
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:15,885
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We have a problem.

1267
01:43:16,022 --> 01:43:18,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who let Snuggles in the pool again?

1268
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:21,182
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I really think you complete me.

1269
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:23,478
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.

1270
01:43:23,613 --> 01:43:26,698
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five. - How can they take this any more?

1271
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, you kids.

1272
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:33,115
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What did you do that for?

1273
01:43:33,248 --> 01:43:35,656
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was just checking. I hope you don't get too sunburned.

1274
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,999
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can peel a man's face right off.

1275
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:39,539
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What is it? - That there's some human spleen.

1276
01:43:39,672 --> 01:43:40,667
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't touch it.

1277
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,043
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's the second time that's happened to me.

1278
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:43,716
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This water thing's great.

1279
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,301
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm urinating right now.

1280
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:48,512
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Adult swim, next five minutes.

1281
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,965
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stay between the buoys.

1282
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,381
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I packed your lunch. Danish is in there

1283
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,178
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I picked the raisins out just the way you like it.

1284
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,304
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't forget, your nasal spray is in your saddle-bag...

1285
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:58,017
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Beans! ...and your moisturising lotion...

1286
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,356
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Now, Beans! We've talked about this. - Lotion?

1287
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:03,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

1288
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:04,899
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sherriff, where are you headed?

1289
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:07,902
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's trouble down a dry creek. Bad Bill's been acting up again.

1290
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:09,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, honey, you come back with all your digits.

1291
01:44:09,995 --> 01:44:11,323
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And don't go trying to be a hero.

1292
01:44:11,455 --> 01:44:12,865
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beans, you are missing the point.

1293
01:44:12,998 --> 01:44:15,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got an image to protect now.

1294
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:17,912
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where's my Tic Tacs?

1295
01:44:19,213 --> 01:44:21,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I found them. - What's going on?

1296
01:44:21,382 --> 01:44:24,087
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, in order to satisfy the needs of the collective,

1297
01:44:24,218 --> 01:44:25,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the hero must abandon the self

1298
01:44:26,137 --> 01:44:30,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and solidify his image as an icon that will forever be remembered.

1299
01:44:30,975 --> 01:44:33,383
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, this is the sunset shot.

1300
01:44:41,778 --> 01:44:44,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Give them a good one, amigo.

1301
01:44:53,373 --> 01:44:54,998
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ready, Excelsior?

1302
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:57,124
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My fellow comrades.

1303
01:44:57,252 --> 01:44:59,826
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There will be times when you doubt yourself.

1304
01:44:59,963 --> 01:45:03,297
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When you feel pummelled by the cataclysms of life,

1305
01:45:03,425 --> 01:45:07,375
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}remember this moment. Remember me.

1306
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:10,551
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Know that I will be there watching you,

1307
01:45:10,725 --> 01:45:13,642
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}sometimes at inappropriate moments.

1308
01:45:13,978 --> 01:45:16,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's part of the deal.

1309
01:45:16,356 --> 01:45:19,974
