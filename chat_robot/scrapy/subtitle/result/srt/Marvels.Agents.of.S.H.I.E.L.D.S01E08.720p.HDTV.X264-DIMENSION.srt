12
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,970
在古代  人们相信
In ancient times, people believed

13
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,420
天堂满是众神  怪兽和魔法世界
the heavens were filled with gods and monsters and magical worlds.

14
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,430
随着时间的推移
Then, as time passed,

15
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,760
那些信仰变成了神话和传说
those beliefs faded into myth and folklore.

16
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,190
但现在我们知道故事是真的
But now we know the stories were true.

17
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,730
像阿斯加德这样的世界是存在的
Other worlds, with names like Asgard, exist.

18
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,560
像托尔这样曾被敬为神的人物
And beings once revered as gods, like Thor,

19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,980
回到地球  留给我们更多的疑问
have returned, leaving us with more questions and...

20
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,200
一大堆烂摊子留待我们清理
An enormous mess to clean up.

21
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,490
别说我没给过你东西
Don't say I never gave you anything.

22

{\an8}英国伦敦
格林威治大学

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,400
还得逐一在小石头上  检测外星的
Checking for alien spectrographic signatures

24
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,880
光谱特征径迹
one teeny rock at a time.

25
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,630
这是必要的预防措施
Necessary precaution.

26
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,950
我们可不想让外星物件被坏人拿到
We don't want anything alien getting in the wrong hands.

27
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,710
即便如此  这工作简单的连猴子都可以完成啊
Still, this is definitely the type of work a monkey could easily do.

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,170
你就是我们的小猴子
You're our little monkey.

29
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,850
{\an8}妈妈&爸爸来电

30
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,790
别那样看着我
Don't give me that look.

31
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,870
我准备好了  自然会接电话
I'll talk to them when I talk to them.

32
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,000
接谁的电话
Talk to who?

33
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,090
妈妈和爸爸
Mum and dad.

34
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,430
他们想知道...
They want explanations and answers for...

35
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,350
有关这些东西的解释
Well, all this.

36
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,820
但是我没法回答他们
But I don't have any answers.

37
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,450
更重要的是  自从我被感染后
And, more importantly, I haven't talked to them

38
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,460
还没跟他们谈过
since I was ill.

39
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,400
如果他们知道了  他们会更害怕
And if they knew that, they'd be even more terrified.

40
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
所以  你知道的
So, you know...

41
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,370
何必浪费时间呢
...why waste any of our time, really?

42
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,660
你们觉得这是陈年旧事
You guys may think it's old news,

43
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,740
其实它...对每个人来说都是新闻
but it's new...news to everybody else.

44
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,330
阿斯加德人是来自另一个星球的外星人
So, Asgardians are aliens from another planet

45
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,470
千年之前曾拜访过我们
that visited us thousands of years ago?

46
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,790
可能还要更早
Or more.

47
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,690
因为我们不了解外星人
And because we couldn't understand aliens,

48
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,220
我们就以为他们是神
we thought they were gods?

49
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,470
北欧神话就是这么诞生的
That's where our Norse mythology comes from.

50
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,710
太疯狂了
That's too crazy.

51
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,680
你们认为其他神也是外星人吗
Do you think other deities are aliens, too?

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,410
毗湿奴[印度教主神之一]肯定是  对吧
Vishnu for sure, right?

53
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,200
哪怕一次也好
You know, it'd be nice if, for once,

54
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,300
真希望托尔和他的人能把
Thor and his people sent down

55
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,240
"搞破坏后自己清理"之神派下来
the god of cleaning up after yourself.

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,770
他们也许有个魔法扫帚之类的
They probably have a magic broom for this kind of thing.

57
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,180
真希望他们把外星飞船留下
I just wish they'd left their alien ship behind.

58
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,670
好让我们把那个也清理吗
So we can clean that up, too?

59
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,010
好让我们进去  看看里面
So we could go inside, take a peek under the hood,

60
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,530
或许兜兜风什么的
maybe take it for a spin.

61
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,070
拜托  难道你要告诉我
Come on, you're telling me

62
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,450
开外星飞船不在你的遗愿清单上吗
piloting an alien ship isn't on your bucket list?

63
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,720
我印象中
I can't think of a single time

64
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,600
外星人物件落到人类手中都没有好下场
when anything alien in human hands ended well.

65
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,500
我倒是不介意让托尔的东西"落到我手中"
Wouldn't mind getting my human hands on Thor.

66
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,570
他是梦幻般的存在
He's so dreamy.

67
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,210
是的  他虽说是挺英俊的  但...
Sure, he's handsome, but --

68
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,540
不  他的确是梦幻般的存在
No. He's dreamy.

69
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,460
菲兹  那是...
Fitz, is that, um --

70
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,930
肯定不是这个星球来的
Definitely not from here.

71
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,200
应该是飞船的一部分  你在干什么
Another piece of the ship. What are you doing?

72
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,440
眼不见...
Out of sight...

73
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,640
...心不烦
...out of mind.

74
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,220
这才是我们来的目的
That's why we're here.

75
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,580
确保一切在控制之下
Keep everything under control.

76
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,700
{\an8}挪威
特莱马卡国家公园

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,460

- Now, who would do something like that? - Who knows.

78
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,270
宝贝  看
Baby, look.

79
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,920
"水之南  山之北"
"South of the water, north of the hill..."

80
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,090
"一圈石头"
"...A halo of stones" --

81
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,980
"环绕大树"
"Protect the tree still."

82
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,100
雅各布  是它吗
Jakob, is this it?

83
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,260
我们应该去看看
We should check that out.

84
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,250
终于找到了
Finally, after all this time.

85
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,600
等不及告诉其他人了
I can't wait to tell the others.

86
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,620
我说过这是真的...
I told you it was real...

87
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,200
而且我会找到的
And that I would find it.

88
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,000
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

89
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,460
不要排斥你感觉到的东西
What you're feeling, don't fight it.

90
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,550
那种愤怒  已经存在于你体内了
That rage, it's already inside of you.

91
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,630
不要害怕  不要隐藏它的力量
Don't be afraid of it. Don't hide from its power.

92
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,880
接纳它
Embrace it.

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,220
接纳它
Embrace it!

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,690
天呐  你们做了什么
God! What have you done?

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,860
{\an8}神盾局特工
第一季 第八集

96
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,350
需要的话你可以让我爬
I can climb it if you want.

97
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,520
但要跟我说怎么用这些...小玩意
Just talk me through what to do with the...doodads.

98
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,830
也就15英尺[4.6米]高
Yeah, it's only about 15 feet.

99
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,300
我没事  我...
I'll be fine. I'm --

100
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,250
只是从那次差点摔死之后
I'm just a bit more wary about the height thing

101
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,460
我就对高度比较谨慎
since falling to certain death.

102
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,600
你很害怕
You're afraid.

103
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,090
在发抖是吗
Hmm? Shaken up?

104
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,650
很正常
It's normal.

105
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,360
但有的感觉就是
But some feelings will take over

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,780
你越去想就会越强烈
if you dwell on them.

107
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,490
特别是恐惧
Especially fear.

108
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,770
现在  一直看前面
Now, keep your eyes ahead.

109
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,130
注意力集中到你最想做的事情上
Focus on what you like to do best.

110
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,670
好的
Yep.

111
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,150
不是掉下去
Not falling.

112
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,090
不是  是调查
No, research.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,270
你是一个科学家  你马上就能解决难题
You're a scientist. You like to figure things out.

114
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,450
是的  用我的小玩意
Yes. With my doodads.

115
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,670
我很好奇
I'm curious.

116
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,600
不管树上的东西是什么
Whatever was up in these trees

117
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,880
都已经在那里几个世纪了  是吗
had to be there for centuries, right?

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,090
至少上千年
At least a millennium.

119
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,160
放射性碳14记录了其中有一些树
Radiocarbon-14 dates some of these trees

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
有九千年了
at 9,000 years old.

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,520
听起来不可能啊  难道树是围着它生长的吗
That sounds impossible. Think the tree grew around it?

122
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,320
我得先查查年轮
I'd have to check the dendrochronology first

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,350
才能确定
to know for certain. Uh-huh.

124
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,820
当然  但是  挪威云杉
Of course. But, I mean, the Norway spruce

125
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,580
是生长相当快的松柏科植物
is a rather fast-growing coniferous,

126
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,970
而且我知道你会骗我再爬高点
and I know you're trying to trick me into going up,

127
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,230
不管怎么说我会往上爬  所以
but I'm going up anyway, so...

128
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,860
如果你掉下来了我会接住你的
I'll catch you if you fall.

129
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,270
尖叫  她眼里还有很多仇恨
Screaming, and so much hate in her eyes.

130
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,880
你说她还拿着一根银棒
And you said she had a silver stick?

131
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,550
也可能是钢的  我  我不知道
Steel, maybe. I-I don't know.

132
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,050
上面  还有图案
It, uh, had decorations on it.

133
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,750
你能形容一下或是画下来吗
Could you describe or draw them?

134
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,870
我没仔细看  我  我就逃了
I didn't get a good look. I I just ran.

135
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,080
谁会做这么邪恶的事
Who would do something so evil?

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
很遗憾你失去了同事
I'm sorry for your loss.

137
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
{\an8}结果:阳性
检测到外星物质

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
这里面的东西
Oh, um, whatever was in here

139
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,580
肯定不是这个世界上的
was definitely not from this world.

140
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,010
菲兹  你收到了吗
Fitz, you getting this?

141
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,540
这不是奇塔瑞的  是吧
It's not Chitauri, is it?

142
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,950
不不不  别担心
No, no, no. Don't worry.

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,480
这不是病毒威胁
This isn't another viral threat.

144
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,860
等一下
Um, hang on.

145
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,720
光谱特征符合资料上的...
Spectrographic signatures match readings from...

146
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,250
雷神托尔之锤
Thor's hammer.

147
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,470
西蒙斯  树里面的东西来自阿斯加德
Simmons, whatever was in that tree is Asgardian.

148
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,330
我  我能看到嵌入的印记
I-I can see an imprint of what was embedded.

149
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,200
三维立体复位扫描
Scanning for three-dimensional restoration.

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,630
好了告诉我
Tell me when.

151
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,260
好了
When.

152
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,540
看上去像是根手杖或者枝条
Um, looks like a staff or a rod.

153
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,650
精心制作  完美雕刻
Well crafted. Engraved.

154
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,290
我转换一下  做一个3D模型
I'll convert it, print a 3-d model.

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,880
这片森林是自然保护区
This forest is a protected reserve.

156
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,600
他们以为他们是谁啊
I mean, who do they think they are?

157
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,860
还有别的什么细节吗
Anything else? Details?

158
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,180
有没有能帮我们找到那些人
Anything that might help us to find these people

159
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,560
或是他们可能藏在哪里的线索
or where they might be hiding?

160
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,670
长官  他们看上去并没有躲
Sir, doesn't look like they're hiding.

161
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,290
{\an8}奥斯陆[挪威首都]街区突发暴力事件

162
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,720
现在发到你手机上
Sending to your devices now.

163
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,440
{\an8}奥斯陆街区突发暴力事件

164
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,050
...造成20人受伤  3人生命垂危
...leaving 20 injured, 3 in critical condition.

165
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,450
报道显示这十余人组成的队伍
Reports indicate that the group of about a dozen

166
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
{\an8}奥斯陆出现暴力事件
据称疑犯仍未被捕

167
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,870
由这一男一女牵头
was led by this man and woman,

168
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,460
尽管还不清楚他们的动机
and though their motive was unclear,

169
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,240
但他们所要传递的信息
their message was hauntingly spelled out

170
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,040
已经留在了奥斯陆的街头
on the streets of Oslo.

171
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,820
看来我们知道他们的身份了
Well, I guess we know who they think they are.

172
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,240
{\an8}我们是神

173
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,980
{\an8}雅各布・奈斯特龙  佩特拉・拉尔森

174
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,470
雅各布・奈斯特龙  三十岁
Jakob Nystrom, 30.

175
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,310
他的女朋友  佩特拉・拉尔森
Girlfriend, Petra Larsen.

176
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,650
一个挪威异教徒组织的领袖
Leaders of a Norse paganist hate group.

177
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,950
多亏了格林威治发生的事
And their numbers are growing,

178
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
和互联网
thanks to what happened in Greenwich

179
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
他们组织的人数还在增长
and thanks to the internet.

180
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
没错  就是互联网  她说得真讽刺啊
Yay, internet, she said sarcastically.

181
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,420
挪威异教徒
Norse paganist?

182
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,050
沉迷于与挪威神话也就是阿斯加德的故事
Obsessed with anything derived from norse mythology --

183
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,120
相关的一切
stories of Asgard.

184
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,730
现在我们要对付的是一件武器
And now a weapon.

185
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,570
只能扫描到其一侧
The scan only accounted for one side.

186
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,350
树上损伤太严重了  难以完全复制
Too much damage to the tree for complete reproduction.

187
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,810
但看看这里  很明显两端都有损伤
But see here -- it's clearly broken on both ends.

188
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,720
也就是说还有其他几部分吗
So there are more pieces?

189
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,210
对  至少还有两部分
Yeah. Two at least.

190
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,070
就是说这对情侣很有可能在找其他几部分
Which means Sid and Nancy may be looking for a complete set.

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,510
{\an8}雅各布・奈斯特龙  佩特拉・拉尔森

192
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,160
这是什么图案  阿斯加德的符号
The markings? Asgardian symbolism.

193
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,210
仅凭我们有限的知识很难进行翻译
Hard to translate with our limited knowledge.

194
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,670
你应该把你那雷神朋友喊过来
You should give your buddy the god of thunder a shout.

195
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,280
他从他的锤子那里得到力量  对吧
He gets his power from his hammer, right?

196
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,410
或许这是他锤子上的螺丝呢
What if this is his nail to the hammer?

197
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,510
我已经找过了
I already did.

198
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,670
弗瑞局长跟我说找不到他
Director Fury told me he's off the grid.

199
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,240
即使他有手机  我们也没他的号码
And if he has a cellphone, we don't have the number.

200
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,010
神盾局主要着手于寻找
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigation are on the trail

201
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,980
奈斯特龙和他的信众
of Nystrom and his followers.

202
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,850
我们负责辨认出目标
We're charged with identifying the object

203
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,880
并抢先一步找到其他几块
and finding any other pieces before they do.

204
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,610
看来他们有些优势
They seem to have some advantage.

205
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,210
他们在150平方公里的挪威森林里
They found this thing in 150 square kilometers

206
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,200
找到这东西
of norwegian forest.

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,040
各位  或许是它用魔法在召唤他们呢
Guys. What if it called to them with magic?

208
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,410
召唤他们吗
Called to them.

209
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,770
我们知道这是阿斯加德的东西
We know it's Asgardian,

210
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,440
所以这方面有很多我们不知道的法则
so the rules are a little bendy here.

211
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,100
我们只不过还没弄明白一些问题
Just because we don't understand something yet

212
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,770
这不意味着我们要倒退回中世纪
doesn't mean we should regress back to the dark ages,

213
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,160
尽说些魔法和神话什么的
talking of magic and fairy tales.

214
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,850
其实  我们正要这么做
Actually, that's exactly what we're going to do.

215
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,130
-你说什么  -真的吗
- Excuse me? - Really?

216
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,920
当我们在新墨西哥找到那锤子的时候
When we first found the hammer in New Mexico,

217
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,770
我请教了一个在全球挪威神话研究方面
I consulted one of the world's leading experts

218
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,640
领头的专家
on Norse Mythology --

219
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,850
埃利奥特・兰道夫
Elliot Randolph,

220
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,840
在塞维尔的一所大学当教授
a professor at a university in Seville.

221
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
我们马上就去找他
We'll leave immediately.

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,580
或许他可以告诉我们更多这些图案的信息
Maybe he can tell us more about these markings.

223
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,910
{\an8}西班牙  塞维尔

224
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,790
有一点必须纠正  埃琳娜
Well, one must adapt, Elena.

225
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,510
最近发生的事让我们改观了
Recent events have thrown us all for a loop.

226
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,700
我一直以为我在教挪威神话
I thought I was teaching Norse Mythology.

227
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,630
其实不然  结果证明我是一个历史学教授
No, turns out I'm a history professor.

228
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,780
就是说  你不打算更改我的分数吗
So, you're not going to change my grade?

229
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,020
不  我会给你一个星期去重写
No. I will give you a week to rewrite it.

230
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,710
我想  一般而言
I think, in general,

231
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,210
应多一点历史描述  少一点评价
Little more history, less lit crit.

232
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,440
但我还是希望今晚我们可以共进晚餐
But I do hope we're still on for dinner tonight.

233
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,140
我列了一个书籍的清单
I've included a list of books there

234
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,420
这些书或许能帮得到你
that might help you.

235
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,750
再见
I'll see you later.

236
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,450
兰道夫教授
Professor Randolph.

237
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,980
科尔森特工  请进  请进
Agent coulson. Come in, come in.

238
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,310
沃特菲尔德44
Waterfield 44.

239
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,900
14k金的笔尖嵌上珍珠母
14-karat-gold nib with mother-of-pearl inlay.

240
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,030
你挺有眼光的嘛
That's quite an eye you've got.

241
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,180
我不知道你还是个收藏家
I didn't know you were a collector.

242
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,670
政府付的钱  我不算是个收藏家
On a government salary, not quite.

243
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,320
我猜你们在伦敦的地上找到些什么
Well, I'm assuming you found something on the ground in London.

244
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,660
在挪威的树里面找到的
In a tree in Norway.

245
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,210
不幸的是
And, unfortunately,

246
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,280
不是我们找到它的
We weren't the ones who found it.

247
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,720
这是个3D模型
It's a 3-D model.

248
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,420
太不可思议了
Oh, that is amazing.

249
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,140
基于这些如尼文
Now, based on these runes,

250
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,530
我得说这是狂暴战士手杖的一部分
I'd say I'm looking at a piece of the berserker staff.

251
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,750
我们来看一看
Let's have a look.

252
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,600
没错  神话故事要追溯到十二世纪晚期
Yeah, the myth dates back to the late 12th century.

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,640
是关于一名来自阿斯加德的强大勇士的
It's all about a powerful warrior from Asgard.

254
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,270
这里
Here.

255
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,210
一名狂暴战士军队的士兵
A soldier in the berserker army.

256
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,100
狂暴战士军队
Berserker army?

257
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,450
是的
Oh, yeah.

258
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,650
一支强大的军队
A powerful army.

259
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,210
曾经是一支残暴的军队
Fierce army it was.

260
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,340
狂暴战士们像愤怒的野兽一样战斗
Berserkers battled like raging beasts,

261
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,160
摧毁他们道路上的一切
destroying everything in their path.

262
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,390
一名狂暴战士拥有二十名勇士的力量
A single berserker had the strength of 20 warriors.

263
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,210
那么无论谁持有手杖就拥有了超人类的力量
So whoever wielded the staff got superhuman strength?

264
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,600
用它战斗会将勇士置于
Fighting with it put the warrior

265
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,260
一种无法控制的愤怒状态
into a state of uncontrollable rage.

266
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,670
手杖拥有一种非常强大的魔法
The staff contained a very powerful magic.

267
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,140
或者一种我们还未发现的科学特性
Or a scientific attribute we've yet to discover.

268
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,370
拥有分析性的头脑并且笑靥如花
Analytically minded and pretty as a peach.

269
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,910
你是在说传说中的勇士吗
The warrior in the story.

270
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,870
在传说中  他来到地球上是为了战斗
Well, in the story, he came to earth to fight,

271
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,670
结果却坠入了爱河
but he ended up falling in love.

272
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,540
爱上了谁
With whom?

273
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,100
爱上了地球上的生活
With life on earth.

274
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,380
通了人性
Humanity.

275
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,650
他爱得如此之深
He fell so much in love

276
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,460
以至于当他的军队返回阿斯加德的时候
that when his army returned to Asgard,

277
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,440
他留了下来
he stayed behind.

278
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,350
手杖怎么样了
What happened to the staff?

279
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,840
他不想让它的黑暗魔法
Well, he didn't want its dark magic

280
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,250
落入错误的人之手
falling into the wrong hands,

281
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,480
所以他把手杖断成三部分
so he broke it into three pieces

282
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,360
每一部分藏在了不同的地方
and hid each one in a different location.

283
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,880
手稿上不会正好有说
The manuscript wouldn't happen to say

284
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,030
他把它们藏在了哪里对吧
where he hid them, would it?

285
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,680
实际上  有说
Actually, it does.

286
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,550
在三首诗里
In three verses.

287
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,190
请诸位铭记在心这些诗意抽象
Now, let's all bear in mind these are poetic abstracts

288
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,070
是从失传已久的古文字里面来的
from long-lost ancient texts.

289
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,460
有一首是关于一棵树
So, there is one about a tree,

290
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,830
看起来他们已经找到了
which they've found, it seems.

291
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,880
另一首  "河流以东  烈日当空
Another is, "East of the river, sun overhead,

292
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,410
与逝去之人的尸骨同埋于土壤中"
buried in earth with the bones of the dead."

293
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,190
有点毛骨悚然  不是吗
That's a bit macabre, isn't it?

294
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,470
还有另外一首
There's another here.

295
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,780
这一首甚至连韵脚都没有
Well, this one doesn't even have a rhyme.

296
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,370
不过它的主旨是  "接近上帝"
But the gist of it is "Close to god."

297
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,000
那可以是指任何东西  不是吗
That could be anything, couldn't it?

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,730
也可能什么都不指
It could also mean nothing.

299
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,480
我还希望能够少一些暗喻
I was hoping for less metaphor,

300
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,910
多一些经纬度之类的
more longitude and latitude.

301
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,630
我想  沿着维京海盗袭击路线搜寻
Well, I mean, it does stand to reason

302
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,160
显然是合乎情理的  不是吗
to search near Viking raid routes, doesn't it?

303
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,230
近来在加拿大沿海一带的巴芬岛
Now, there have been some recent interesting findings

304
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,020
有些关于挪威人遗迹的有趣的发现
of Norse relics on Baffin Island off the coast of Canada.

305
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,640
可谓史前古器物中的无价之宝
Yeah, virtual treasure trove of new artifacts.

306
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,730
那么我们就从那里入手  谢谢你  教授
We'll start there, then. Thank you, professor.

307
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,210
你知道巴芬岛上有一座托尔峰吗
Did you know there's Mount Thor on Baffin Island?

308
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,910
不知道
I did not.

309
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,390
你知道托尔峰上没有什么吗
Do you know what's not on Mount Thor?

310
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,320
和阿斯加德有半点联系的东西都没有
Anything Asgardian at all.

311
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,400
我们在那里的特工什么都没有找到
Our agents on the ground haven't found a thing.

312
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,460
你这里怎么样
What about you?

313
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,180
奈斯特龙深度网络中的留言板上
Nystrom's deep-web message boards

314
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,100
正有一群疯子在叽叽喳喳
are just abuzz with psychos.

315
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,010
他们坚信自己将升仙为
They believe they're gonna ascend

316
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,070
死亡与毁灭之神
to be the gods of destruction and death.

317
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,100
都是些鸟人  长官
People suck, sir.

318
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,450
这就是你的进展吗  "都是些鸟人"
That's your progress? "People suck"?

319
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,530
这些人确实很烂
These people do.

320
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,820
另外他们还喋喋不休有关进行地下行动
And there's also chatter about going underground.

321
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,330
可能是指隐姓埋名或者...
Could mean going incognito or...

322
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,750
或者寻找手杖的下一部分
Or searching for the next piece.

323
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,330
兰道夫说要沿着维京人的路线搜索
Randolph said to check viking routes.

324
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,020
找到其它的了吗
Find any others?

325
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,120
在俄罗斯境内的伏尔加河沿岸有些遗址
There's some sites along the Volga River in Russia,

326
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,230
基辅也有一些  更奇怪的是  这里也有
Some in Kiev, and, weirdly, here.

327
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,750
{\an8}塞维尔

328
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,420
在西班牙的塞维尔吗
In Seville, Spain?

329
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,410
可能性比较小
It's a long shot,

330
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,540
但维京人曾两次侵占过塞维尔
but vikings sacked Seville twice.

331
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,060
我们找到一个有可能存放维京遗物的地点
We found one promising location with viking relics --

332
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,630
艾尔德维诺尼诺
El Divino Nino.

333
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,500
一个建立在公元八世纪地穴废墟上的教堂
A church built on the ruins of an 8th-century crypt

334
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,560
而在那之前是个公元前206年的罗马遗址
built on Roman ruins from 206 B.C.

335
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,500
河流的东边
East of a river.

336
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,880
还有许多的遗骨
And lots of bones.

337
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,650
看看我们能不能发现[挖出]点什么
Let's see what we can dig up.

338
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,030
听出我的双关语了吗
See what I did there?

339
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,480
这感觉一定不错
Must be nice --

340
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,380
能有规定的午休时间
have a mandatory nap time.

341
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,410
午休不是政府规定的
Siesta isn't mandatory.

342
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,410
{\an8}气候炎热国家如西班牙等有午睡的习惯

343
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,420
但午睡确实是件美事
Just very pleasant.

344
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,480
你怎么样  沃德特工
How you doing, Agent Ward?

345
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,210
真希望我没长这么高
Wishing I was shorter.

346
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,490
暂时还没有发现
Nothing yet.

347
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,270
{\an8}检测结果  无异常

348
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,210
我的仪器读数显示一切正常
All my readings are normal.

349
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,760
那你呢  斯凯  运气怎么样
What about you, Skye? Any luck?

350
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,500
幸运的是我的监管人员
I'm lucky my S.O. volunteered

351
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,900
主动提出搜索那条最阴森恐怖的走道
to take the super-creepy hallway

352
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,190
而把这间好不到哪去的地牢留给了我
instead of the slightly less-creepy dungeon-room place.

353
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,220
我没有发现
I got nothing.

354
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,500
抱歉  啥都没有
Sorry -- nada.

355
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,370
沃德  你的光谱仪检测出周围有异常
Ward, your spectrograph is reading something near you.

356
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,260
我什么都没看见
I don't see anything.

357
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,660
仪器显示就在你正前方
Well, it's right in front of you.

358
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,460
等等...不对  好吧...稍等
Oh, wait. No. Uh, okay, hold on.

359
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,130
它正在移动  西北方向
It's moving. Northwest.

360
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,670
我看到可疑人物了
Visual contact.

361
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,280
沃德  向左转
Ok Ward, turn left.

362
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,100
我可以解释这一切
I have a wonderful explanation.

363
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
你是想说碰巧撞见一些异常...
Ran into some unexpected com--

364
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,940
沃德  发生了什么事
Ward, what's happening?

365
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,610
他的仪器刚刚失去了联系
His device just went down.

366
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,650
-斯凯  你能...  -已经在路上了
- Skye, can you get... - Already on it.

367
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,050
沃德
Ward.

368
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,190
你还好吗
Are you all right?

369
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,590
格兰特  冷静点  求你了
Grant, calm down. Calm down, please.

370
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,680
冷静下来
Calm down.

371
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,420
手杖...被他拿走了
The staff -- he has it.

372
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,780
沃德有点不对劲
Something's wrong with Ward.

373
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,480
手杖也不见了  有人拿走了它
The staff's gone. Someone took it.

374
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,530
我也有一截
I have one, too.

375
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,490
他不会就这么凭空消失的
He can't just disappear.

376
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,100
他总要找个地方回到...
He'll have to turn up some...

377
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,170
地面
...where.

378
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,290
就是那里
There we go.

379
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,430
距小教堂南边一个街区的位置
A block south of the chapel.

380
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,460
教授
Professor.

381
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,140
我搞砸了
I screwed up.

382
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,830
-这么做真没必要  -很有必要
- This is ridiculous. - It's anything but.

383
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,530
沃德  你刚刚昏迷了
Ward, you passed out.

384
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,330
而且你现在的举止很不正常
And you were acting not right.

385
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,270
科尔森命令我给你做一个详细的全面检查
Coulson ordered me to give you a full work-up,

386
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,880
这就是我正在做的
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

387
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,610
在你失去知觉前
Um, before you lost consciousness,

388
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,220
你有没有产生幽闭恐惧症的感觉
were you feeling claustrophobic?

389
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,840
为什么这么问
Why?

390
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
她只是在排除恐惧发作的可能性
She's ruling out a panic attack.

391
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,290
我从不会感到恐惧  从来不会
I don't panic. Ever.

392
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,970
好的  排除这项
There we go. Ruled out.

393
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,870
你是触碰了手杖才这样的  是吗
Touching the staff caused it, right?

394
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,060
有任何残留的症状吗
Any residual effects?

395
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,170
你是否感受到身体内有异于寻常的力量
Are you exhibiting any extra s-strength?

396
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,040
不如我拿那家伙来试试
Why don't I find out on that guy?

397
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,230
不如我们还是别这么做比较好
Why don't we not do that?

398
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,630
在你昏迷之前
What's the last thing you remember

399
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,070
你记得的最后一件事是什么
before you lost consciousness?

400
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,250
这简直是浪费时间
This is a waste of time.

401
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,280
我们得尽快找到手杖
We need to find the staff.

402
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,560
你到底记得了什么
What exactly do you remember?

403
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,570
一些我很久都没有想起过的事
Something I hadn't thought about in a long time.

404
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,690
我们还是别问了
Why don't we leave it alone?

405
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,330
我是说  他刚把手臂抽出了...
Well, I mean, he just pulled his arm out of this --

406
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,070
安静
Quiet!

407
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,140
我想听他说什么
I want to hear this.

408
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,070
我的手下受伤了  手杖不见了
One of my men is hurt. The staff is gone.

409
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,580
我也不想那样
I didn't want any of that to happen.

410
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,830
那你想怎样
What did you want?

411
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,090
你想自己独享手杖的力量么
The staff's power for yourself?

412
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,570
根本不是那样
Nothing like that.

413
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,620
我只是想成为第一个研究它的人
You know, I just wanted to be the first to study it,

414
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,150
证明狂暴战士真的曾经来过这里
to prove that the Berserkers were actually here,

415
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,700
是历史的一部分
a part of history.

416
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,740
你试想一下那会怎样
You think about that.

417
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,730
我在想
Oh, I'm thinking about it.

418
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,660
你在干什么
What are you doing?

419
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,070
你的心率在上升  肾上腺素分泌激增
Your heart rate's rising. Adrenaline's spiking.

420
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,610
你需要冷静下来  不能情绪激动
You need to calm down, not get worked up.

421
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,850
那段回忆  是有关你弟弟的么
The memory -- was it about your brother?

422
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,500
别说了
Drop it.

423
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,960
沃德  如果你需要宣泄一下情绪
Ward, if you need to get it out,

424
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,400
我可以和你
I am here --

425
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,350
谈谈么
Right. To talk.

426
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,940
因为你就只会谈谈  谈了又谈
Because that's what you do -- talk...and talk.

427
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,970
你都不会对自己的声音感到厌倦么
Don't you ever get tired of hearing your own voice?

428
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,500
沃德  别这样
Ward, stop.

429
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,360
这就说得通了
Well! This makes more sense.

430
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,090
沃德  你所经历的  现在这种感觉
Ward, what you're experiencing, this feeling --

431
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,570
是一种化学反应
It's chemistry.

432
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,430
希望如此
Hope so.

433
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,880
是的  他的促肾上腺皮质激素出现峰值
Yeah, spikes in his adrenocorticotropic hormone.

434
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,440
就像你听到的那些故事里讲的一样
It's like those stories you hear

435
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,640
一个母亲为了救自己的孩子抬起了一辆车
when a mother is able to lift a car to save her baby.

436
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,910
肾上腺素激增可以产生巨大的
An adrenaline surge can create a massive --

437
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,030
别说了
Stop talking!

438
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,840
治好它
Just fix it!

439
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,220
我也希望我能
I wish I could.

440
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,480
我们可以减轻部分症状
We can relieve some of the symptoms.

441
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,520
我会给你注射10毫升的苯二氮
I'm going to give you 10cc of benzodiazepine.

442
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,350
冷静小药丸  好主意
Chill pill. Good idea.

443
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,560
镇静剂  不可能
A sedative? Not gonna happen.

444
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,150
讲讲道理  看看你现在的样子
Yeah, well, be reasonable. Look how you're behaving.

445
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,530
如果给我注射了镇静剂
And if I'm sedated

446
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,670
然后我们碰上了那群"嗨翻"的疯子
and we cross paths with those juiced freaks,

447
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,360
那群掀翻车子  把人压扁的疯子
the ones who flip cars and smash people up,

448
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,140
你来解决掉他们么
are you gonna take them on?

449
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,220
你来保护我们么
Keep us safe?

450
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,080
还是要我再救西蒙斯一次
Or am I gonna have to save Simmons' ass...again?

451
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,530
那只是生物化学反应
That was just a biochemical reaction.

452
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,870
他不是那个意思
He didn't mean all that.

453
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,470
我懂
No, I know.

454
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,770
不用解释
No explanation necessary.

455
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,050
他们怎么找到它的  我完全没有头绪
How'd they find it? I have no idea how they found it.

456
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,960
他们也许有原始文本
They may have the original texts.

457
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,330
跟我没关系
I wasn't involved.

458
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,470
你知道么  这只是一个
You know, it was just a chance to uncover something

459
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,630
发掘神从天堂带来之物的机会
that the gods brought down from the heavens.

460
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,200
那是外星人带来的  从外太空
Aliens brought it. From space.

461
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,410
我曾经和外星人独处过
I've spent some one-on-one time with aliens before.

462
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,040
相处得并不融洽
Didn't work out too well.

463
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,900
所以这类案件对我来讲  很私人化
So cases like this are personal to me.

464
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,500
我只知道这些
That's all I know.

465
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,130
好好待着吧
Get comfortable.

466
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,080
帮帮我
Help me!

467
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,600
求你了  帮帮我
Please! Help me!

468
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,340
帮帮我
Help me!

469
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,630
求你了
Please!

470
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,850
沃德
Hey, Ward!

471
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,030
你应该更加小心
You should be more careful.

472
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,960
我没事  你呢
I'm fine. You?

473
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,220
我正在试图解决这个问题
I'm working it out.

474
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,860
你在猛击泄愤
You're punching things.

475
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,330
这是你最不需要做的事情了
The last thing you need is to punch things.

476
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,750
那你有别的好办法么
You got a better idea?

477
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,690
让我帮你吧
Let me help you.

478
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,570
我现在唯一需要的帮助就是
The only help I need is to stop those guys

479
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,520
在那些家伙再伤人之前阻止他们
before they hurt somebody else.

480
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,580
我们是新的秩序
We are the new order!

481
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,050
我们的世界正在被众神夺走
Our world is being taken by gods!

482
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,660
我们将要成为众神并把它夺回来
We will become gods and take it back!

483
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,540
这就是新的秩序
This is the new order!

484
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,630
你准备将权力夺回来了吗
Are you ready to take back the power?

485
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,840
{\an8}神盾局移动行动小组
地点  审讯室

486
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,420
你有时间吗  长官
A moment, sir?

487
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
进来吧
Come on in.

488
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,840
我担心之前与那件武器的接触
I'm concerned that my exposure to that weapon

489
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,700
严重影响了我的工作能力
has compromised my ability to do my job.

490
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,500
继续说
Go on.

491
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,450
你知道我家史
You're familiar with my family history.

492
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,820
因显而易见的原因  我不会回想自己的童年
So, for obvious reasons, I don't think back to childhood.

493
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,460
从不
Ever.

494
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,560
有些事我很久以前就封存起来了
There are things I put away a long time ago.

495
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,050
封得严严实实
On lockdown.

496
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,410
因为要做好现在的工作  我必须专注  机智
Because to do this, I have to be focused, tactical.

497
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,330
我不能分心
I can't be distracted.

498
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,630
尤其不能被很久以前发生的一些事分心
Especially by things that happened a lifetime ago.

499
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,810
你的意思是摸了那件东西会释放某些记忆
You're saying touching the staff unlocked certain memories.

500
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,170
最痛苦的记忆
My worst memory.

501
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,510
我第一次感觉到...
The first time I felt...

502
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,120
仇恨
hate.

503
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,210
而且这种感觉挥之不去
And it won't go away.

504
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,090
我不信任我自己
I don't trust myself.

505
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,590
我在实验室里对斯凯和菲茨・西蒙斯发火...
The way I went off at Skye and Fitz-Simmons in the lab --

506
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,660
格兰特  你告诉我这些
Grant... you telling me this

507
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,110
让我感觉我可以信任你
makes me feel I can trust you.

508
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,440
可是他...
Him, on the other hand...

509
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,320
我无法让教授开口
I can't get the professor to talk.

510
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,880
你不是积压了些愤怒吗
You've got some rage built up.

511
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,340
现在是时候发泄一下了
Maybe it's time to let it out.

512
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,280
你得开口说实话
You need to start talking.

513
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,390
我知道的  都已经跟科尔森特工说了
I told Agent Coulson everything I know.

514
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,510
你在撒谎
You're lying.

515
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,480
告诉我那玩意对我做了什么
Tell me what that thing did to me

516
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,300
我怎样才能恢复
and how fix it.

517
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,900
我发誓我真的不知道
I swear I don't know.

518
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,080
那好吧
Okay, then.

519
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,690
你说得对
You were right.

520
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,820
他是阿斯加德人
He's Asgardian.

521
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,060
这是好事
Good thing.

522
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,970
否则那就太尴尬了
Otherwise, that would have been awfully embarrassing.

523
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,520
好吧  我很想知道
Okay, I have to know.

524
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,970
你是怎么发现的
How did you figure me out?

525
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,550
推理
Did the math.

526
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,530
第一  你不是我抓住的第一个阿斯加德人
One -- you're not the first Asgardian I've had in custody.

527
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,380
你们这种人不会因被抓而畏惧或者慌张
You guys don't flinch or panic in captivity.

528
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,910
第二  就凭教授那点工资
Two -- a Waterfield 44?

529
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,680
能买得起沃特菲尔德44号吗
On a lit professor's salary?

530
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,890
我看未必
I don't think so.

531
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,430
最后
And lastly,

532
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,950
如果我告诉别人我跟外星人
when I tell someone I've had some one-on-one time

533
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,240
独处过
with an alien,

534
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,960
一般人会比较好奇
they tend to be a little curious.

535
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,620
显然你比一般人更具洞察力  科尔森特工
Well, you're certainly more observant than most, Agent Coulson.

536
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,820
你就是那个留下的阿斯加德人对吧
So, you're the Asgardian warrior who stayed.

537
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,440
不要跟别人说  拜托了
Please don't tell anyone.

538
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,650
真是没想到啊
I had no clue.

539
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,700
你呢
Did you?

540
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,010
就在光天化日之下  一个真正阿斯加德人
Hidden in plain sight -- an actual Asgardian.

541
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,780
太厉害了
Brilliant.

542
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,470
你觉得他在地球上待了多久了
How long do you suppose he's been on our planet?

543
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,390
一千年  可能更久
A thousand years. Maybe more.

544
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,740
如果我们把他稍微割开一下
If we could just cut him open a little bit,

545
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,140
提取些组织样本  或者是体液
get some tissue samples, maybe some bodily fluids,

546
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,090
那就可以确定了
we could find out.

547
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,110
也可以直接问他啊  你个怪人
Or we could just ask him, weirdo.

548
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,810
这个比看历史频道过瘾多了
This is way, way better than the history channel.

549
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,170
这家伙经历过所有恐怖的事件
I mean, this guy has lived through all the scary stuff --

550
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,360
十字军东征  黑死病  迪斯科
the Crusades, the Black Death, disco.

551
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,150
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

552
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,260
把审讯室的门封上
Sealing the interrogation-room door.

553
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,720
科尔森下的命令
Coulson's orders.

554
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,010
要把我关起来啊
Ah, locking me in.

555
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,340
更严密的牢房我都待过
Well, I've been in tighter spots.

556
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,620
这间屋子是由碳化硅涂层的
This room is made of a silicon carbide-coated

557
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,200
震金合金打造
vibranium alloy.

558
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,550
专门用来关你这种人
Meant for prisoners like yourself.

559
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,060
但你也在这里面
But you're in here, too.

560
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,660
那扇门终归还是得打开
And eventually, somebody will open that door.

561
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,420
我让他们打开才会打开
Not if I tell them not to.

562
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,840
这么说  神话就是你的自传
So, the myth is your autobiography.

563
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,140
不是我写的
I didn't write it.

564
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,740
我不想让人知道我的身份
I didn't want anyone to know about me.

565
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,920
可我管不住自己的嘴
Then I had to open my big mouth.

566
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,990
你是被俘虏了
Were you captured?

567
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,590
还是被严刑拷打
Tortured?

568
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,150
性欲
Horny.

569
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,220
1546年我和一名法国女孩相识
I met a French girl in 1546.

570
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,320
她喜欢听故事
Ah, she loved stories.

571
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,320
所以
So...

572
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,480
我给她讲了一个很棒的故事
I told her a great one.

573
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:45,640
告诉她关于留下来的那个阿斯加德人的事
All about the peaceful Asgardian warrior who stayed.

574
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,580
我怎么会知道
Now, how was I to know

575
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,230
她的牧师哥哥会将其记录下来
her brother the priest would write it all down

576
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,620
后来成了  我也不清楚  神话
and turn it into, I don't know, a thing?

577
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,350
你知道托尔吗
Do you know Thor?

578
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,970
当然  我耗费一生精力想要结识
Oh, sure, I spent all my days palling around

579
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,640
未来的阿斯加德之王
with the future king of Asgard.

580
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
我当然不认识托尔
No, I don't know Thor.

581
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,620
我是个石匠
I was a mason.

582
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,990
凿石头的
I broke rocks.

583
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,990
你根本无法想象
For thousands of years.

584
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,650
我凿了几千年的石头
If you can imagine that.

585
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,010
所以他们来征兵时
So when they came, asking for people to fight,

586
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,550
很自然地  我就参军了
Yes, of course I signed up.

587
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,780
我其实就是想到处走走
I think, really, I just wanted to travel.

588
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,300
但你有手杖
But you had the staff.

589
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,690
我讨厌那玩意
I hated that thing.

590
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,640
其他人沉溺于狂怒所带来的力量
Other guys loved all the power that comes with the rage.

591
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,190
但是我不为所动
No, I didn't like it at all.

592
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,160
看起来  你和我一样
And you don't, either, it seems.

593
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,160
那手杖对我做了什么
What did it do to me?

594
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,190
它能在你内心最阴暗的角落点一盏灯
It shines a light into your dark places.

595
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,000
不管你是人类  还是阿斯加德人
Doesn't matter if you're human, asgardian.

596
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
效果都一样
The effect is the same --

597
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,560
让人不舒服
Unpleasant.

598
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,010
"点一盏灯"  说了等于没说
"Shines a light." That's no explanation.

599
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,910
手杖由一种稀有金属锻造而成
It was forged from a rare metal

600
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,550
对任何持有者都起作用
and reacts to whoever is holding it.

601
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,750
或产生互通
Or interacts.

602
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,040
我大费周章
I went to such great lengths

603
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,740
就是为了不让手杖被发现
to make sure that the staff wasn't found.

604
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,260
不幸的是  传说被记录了下来
Unfortunately, since the myth was written down,

605
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,230
几千年来  有人不停地寻找手杖
people have been searching for it for centuries.

606
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,380
在他们拿到最后一截手杖前
I need your help to stop them

607
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,170
我需要你的帮助去阻止这些人
before they get the last piece of your staff.

608
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,310
可我现在是和平爱好者
Oh, I am a pacifist now.

609
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,950
而且你不希望自己的身份暴露
And you don't want to risk your identity being discovered.

610
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,040
听着  我不担心
Listen, I wouldn't worry too much

611
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,010
那些冲动的年轻人
about these angry youths.

612
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,230
他们总会冷静下来
They always calm down,

613
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,340
然后最终  衰老消逝
and eventually, they die of old age.

614
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,040
这就是地球上生命的可贵之处
And that is one of the pleasant aspects of life here.

615
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,440
万物变化无穷
Everything changes.

616
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,390
我来告诉你什么会变化
I'll tell you what's gonna change --

617
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,010
你的隐匿身份
Your anonymity...

618
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,790
除非你帮助我找到最后一截手杖
Unless you help up find the final piece of your staff.

619
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,300
你可能不认识托尔
You may not know Thor.

620
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,900
但我认识
But I do.

621
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,660
爱尔兰是我初来地球时的挚爱
My first love on this planet was Ireland.

622
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,060
那里有一座庙宇  那里的僧侣
There was a monastery, and the monks gave me

623
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,590
给了我舒睡的地方
a nice, warm place to sleep,

624
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,270
几碗汤
some soup,

625
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,250
还有一些热红酒
and some mulled wine.

626
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,700
"近神之地"
"Near god."

627
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,520
手杖所施加的效果
The effects of the staff.

628
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,460
是永久的吗
Are they permanent?

629
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,210
力量会慢慢消退
The strength wears off.

630
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,550
之后你会感到精疲力尽
You will feel exhausted afterwards.

631
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,030
需要睡眠
You'll need sleep.

632
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,350
那...
What about...

633
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,800
其他不良反应呢
the other effects?

634
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,370
你是说心底那阴暗而猛烈的痛
Oh, that dark, nasty ache in the pit of your stomach,

635
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,170
还有胸腔那股让你以为
the rage in your chest that makes you feel

636
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,180
心要爆炸的愤怒
as if your heart's about to explode?

637
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,970
人类会更难受些
It's worse on humans.

638
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,470
但过个几十年
But give it a few decades,

639
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,690
终会消退
and it'll wear off, too.

640
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,740
真是太好了
Great.

641
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,020
你觉得沃德的状况适合出外勤吗
Are you sure Ward's okay to go into the field?

642
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,150
他显然有点不在状态
He's not exactly acting like himself.

643
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,510
他知道这一点
But he knows it.

644
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,230
他没问题
He'll be fine.

645
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,160
我同意科尔森的意见
I'm with Coulson.

646
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,590
有段时间没来了  我想...
Well, it's been a while. I wonder --

647
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,780
是的  就在这里
Ah, yes. There it is.

648
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,360
还在这里
Still here.

649
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,200
鼻子画得不太像  但是
Well, the nose isn't quite right, but --

650
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,360
那是你吗
That's you?

651
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,900
是的  他们当我像圣人一样尊奉
Yeah. They venerated me a bit as a saint.

652
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,190
他们是白痴
They're idiots.

653
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,480
手杖在哪里
Where's the staff?

654
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,720
在楼上
It's upstairs.

655
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,660
那是正常的沃德还是更狂暴的沃德
Is that the normal Ward or the new, angrier Ward?

656
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,900
分辨不出
I can't tell.

657
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,940
好安静
It's quiet.

658
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,780
不然我怎么会放心地把秘密交给他们
Why do you think I trusted them with my secret?

659
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,880
因为他们发誓保守秘密
They take a vow of silence.

660
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,630
但当你逼他们说时
But when you get them talking...

661
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,510
他们会尖叫[告密]
they squeal.

662
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,500
如果你要战胜神
If you want to defeat a god,

663
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,030
你就必须成为神
you must become one.

664
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,750
我们得帮他
We need to help him!

665
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,500
我去追她
I'll get her.

666
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,060
他怎么样了
How is he?

667
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,400
我不知道该怎么做  他不是人类
I don't know what to do. He's not human.

668
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,260
他要死了
He's dying.

669
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,820
我们知道  但她不懂他的身体构造
We know, but she doesn't understand his anatomy.

670
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,890
-而我都...  -老天啊
- And I'm even w-- - What in god's name?

671
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,020
我的天呐
Oh, my god.

672
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,400
有时你必须站出来
Sometimes, you have to just jump in

673
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,790
把事情搞清楚
and figure things out.

674
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,880
阿斯加德人的再生能力比我们快
Now, Asgardians regenerate faster than we do.

675
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,570
也许我们尽可能维持他的生命
Maybe we can keep him alive long enough--

676
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,480
好让他的身体能自愈
For his body to heal itself.

677
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,100
那我现在要找什么
Okay, what am I looking for?

678
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,410
他的心脏
His heart.

679
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,680
救救我
Help me!

680
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,310
我好像找到了
Oh, okay. I think I got it.

681
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,330
-心脏  -好极了
- Heart. - Oh, yeah.

682
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,660
有没有撕破或是断裂
Can you feel a tear or rupture?

683
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,250
在他的心脏上施加压力  尽量放慢出血
Clamp down hard on his heart. Try to slow the bleeding.

684
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,100
格兰特  放下手杖
Grant, drop the staff.

685
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,930
离我远点
Get away from me.

686
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,130
-沃德特工  -你不是这样的
- Agent Ward. - This isn't you.

687
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,060
退后
Get back.

688
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,970
求求你  救救我
Please! Help me!

689
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,300
求求你
Please!

690
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,540
求求你
Please!

691
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,270
格兰特
Grant.

692
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,610
救救我
Help me! 

693
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,910
求求你  救救我
Please, help me!

694
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,830
格兰特
Grant!

695
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,300
-还不行  格兰特  -救救我
- Not yet, Grant. - Help me!

696
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,280
-但是他要  -还不是时候
- But he's gonna-- - Not yet.

697
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,380
如果你抛下绳子  我就会把你也扔进去
Throw him the rope, and I'll throw you in there, too.

698
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,160
求求你
Please!

699
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,420
格兰特
Grant!

700
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,020
我的天呐  你还好吧
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

701
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,330
过来
Come here.

702
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,490
你在开玩笑吧
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

703
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,710
这次让我帮忙
This time, let me help.

704
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,720
来吧
Come on.

705
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,870
我一点也不怕你
I am not afraid of you.

706
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,250
我死了吗
Am I dead?

707
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,040
看来没有
Apparently not.

708
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,920
千年来  你无疑是我见过
You are easily the most beautiful thing I've seen

709
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,190
最漂亮的尤物
in a thousand years.

710
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,390
科尔森这么做了吗
Coulson did that?

711
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,810
他就这样把手塞进去了
He just shoved his hand inside?

712
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,620
他必须那样做  我僵住了  不知道该怎么做
Well, he had to. I froze, didn't know what to do.

713
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,880
你没僵住
Hey, you didn't freeze.

714
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,030
你只是不会
You just won't be up for the idea

715
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,070
把手伸进别人的胸腔里
put your hand inside somebody else's chest.

716
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,370
{\an8}老妈老爸来电

717
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,230
也许我该站出来了
Maybe I should jump in.

718
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,590
是的
Yeah.

719
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,710
老爸
Hi, dad.

720
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,350
我也很高兴听到你的声音
Yeah, it's great to hear your voice, too.

721
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,750
我这几天一直想打电话给你
I've been meaning to call you for a couple of days.

722
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,670
这几周比较辛苦
It's been a difficult few weeks.

723
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,430
你拿着手杖的时候  看到什么了吗
When you held it, did you see anything?

724
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,070
那你是怎么做到的
Then how?

725
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,490
你怎么拿得了三个
How did you hold all three?

726
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,840
因为我每天都看到
Because I see it every day.

727
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,090
我见过这种神情
I know that look.

728
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,530
你动心了
You tempted?

729
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,150
你想看到的是什么
Now, what is it you want to see?

730
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,140
我们有很多相似之处
You and I have a lot in common.

731
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,810
我们都被刺中过心脏
We've both been stabbed in the heart.

732
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,850
我被杀死了
I was killed.

733
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,070
差不多算是
Well, almost.

734
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,840
我记不大清了
I'm hazy on that.

735
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,610
死后  一片空白
Afterwards... is kind of a blank.

736
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,820
没有被救活的记忆
I have no memory of being revived,

737
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,970
没有在医院的记忆
of being in a hospital.

738
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,780
只是在几个月后醒来了
Just...woke up a few months later.

739
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,480
你觉得很困扰吗  科尔森先生
And are you haunted by it, Mr. Coulson?

740
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,850
不觉得
No.

741
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,090
不算是
Not exactly.

742
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,870
那你纠结什么啊
Then what's the problem?

743
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,180
我想你说得对
I suppose you're right.

744
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,710
我们能送你回大学吗
Can we give you a lift back to the university?

745
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,080
欧洲现在对阿斯加德的事物
Well, you know, with Europe's new fascination

746
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,200
很是着迷
with all things Asgardian,

747
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,390
我在想是否该在别的地方重新开始了
I'm wondering if it's time to start over somewhere else.

748
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,870
美丽的海滩
Nice beach?

749
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,780
过喝热带饮料  做按摩的生活吗
Life of tropical drinks and massages?

750
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,450
我会觉得无聊的
Mm, oh, I'd get bored.

751
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,680
你该考虑美国西北地区
You should consider the American northwest.

752
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,090
也许是波兰
Maybe Portland.

753
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,680
那里有很多美食  交响乐团也很棒
Good food scene. Great philharmonic.

754
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,420
除非你会来探望我
Well, if you will come and visit.

755
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,900
我可不会和随便什么人都分享我的经历
It's not everyone I get to share my stories with.

756
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,040
行啊
Sure.

757
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,510
如果托尔刚好在  我会帮你引见
And if Thor's in town, I'll introduce you.

758
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,460
我能习惯夜床服务
I could get used to turndown service

759
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,470
和枕头上的几块薄荷糖
and little mints on my pillow.

760
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,030
通宵工作不常有
Overnights aren't standard.

761
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,010
我们该好好享受一夜
We deserve a nice night.

762
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,770
特别是你
You especially.

763
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,220
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

764
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,780
不大好
Not great.

765
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,460
对不起
I'm sorry.

766
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,230
因为之前的事
For before.

767
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,260
我
I'm...

768
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,760
我不是那个人
I'm not that guy.

769
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,330
当你救人性命时
When you're a guy who saves lives,

770
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,460
我能忽视些许"绿巨人的愤怒"
I can overlook a little Hulk rage.

771
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,030
没有伤害  就不算犯规
No harm, no foul.

772
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,990
你就让一切都随风而逝吗
Does everything just roll off your back?

773
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,700
不是
No.

774
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,610
如果这样有所帮助  我会一直生气
If it helped, I'd rage all the time,

775
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,960
但那样没有帮助
but it doesn't.

776
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,520
我看到的
What I saw...

777
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,560
是关于我弟弟的事
It was about my brother.

778
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,720
我猜到了
I figured.

779
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,360
我知道你不喜欢聊天
I know you're not one to talk,

780
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,440
但我说过  我在你身边
but, like I said, I'm here.

781
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,340
可以借你个肩膀
My shoulder's free.

782
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,290
我累坏了
I'm beat.

783
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,290
也许下次吧
Another time, maybe.

784
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,760
你知道我在哪里
Well, you know where I live.

785
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,370
漫威《神盾局特工》
"Marvel's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

786
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,090
很快回来
will return in a moment.

787
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,060
我睡着了吗
Did I fall asleep?

788
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,120
睡了一小会儿
For a little while.

789
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,020
但是  那样很好
But, uh, that's good.

790
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,020
说明你放松了
It means you are relaxed.

791
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,150
我的感觉正是如此  放松
That's precisely how I'm feeling -- relaxed.

792
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,620
老实说  塔希提岛太过美好  简直让人难以置信
Honestly, Tahiti's too good to be true.

793
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,500
我知道
I know.

794
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,070
这是个神奇的地方
It's a magical place.
