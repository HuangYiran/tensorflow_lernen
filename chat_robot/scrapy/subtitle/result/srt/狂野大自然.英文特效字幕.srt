{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe it's something technical.

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,720

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-I've tried everything. -Everything?

286

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-You tried everything? -What are you saying?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.

288
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't think I could do that, Benny.

289
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean...

290

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!

326
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We've got to find him!

327
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That is not good! Not good at all!

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}where stiff lady with spikes on her head...

332

334
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stiff lady, spikies?

335
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,500

337
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.

338
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!

339
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,120


340
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am sorry for this. I really am.

341
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hello?

342

343
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You always say that.

344
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I keep on sayin' it. No one's listenin'.

345
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Like a broken record here.

346
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK. When do we leave, Sammy?

347
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, when do we leave?

348
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's not "we." It's me. Let's make this clear.

349
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.

350
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We'll come too! We're not afraid.

351
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are we, guys?

352
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Afraid? No.

353
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know koalas. More like "scared of things."

354
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ryan's like a cub to all of us.

355
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.

356
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, there's that famous... A koala once said,

357

358
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. Anyway.

359
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-So we're helping, whatever it takes. -You want to leave with me? OK.

360
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...

361
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}...stuffed... -OK!

362
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}...or worse, then fine.

363
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.

364
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.

365
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nobody's leaving but me. Got it?

366
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-You're the boss. -You bet.

367
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-You got the big hair. -Absolutely.

368
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's good, Sammy.

369
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, way to weed out the weak links.

370
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?

371
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,320


372
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't worry about a thing, big guy.

373
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got it all taken care of.

374
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know this city...

378
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're there!

379
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

380
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What? -We're going to help you find Ryan!

381

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."

382
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Oh, great. -Hey, guys.

383
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got popcorn up my bum.

384
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,930


385
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do I look trashy in this?

386
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK, here's my...

387
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here's my overall plan. Where are we going?

388
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!

389
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And now I have to worry about you three?

390
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, fine. When do we get off of this thing, Benny?

391
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Benny's here?

392
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, he's right there.

393
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Benny?

394
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Benny!

395
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great. Now what am I gonna do?

396
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys! Guys! I think we should duck!

397
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is she saying?

398
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She said, "Duck down!"

399
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Duck!

400
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am not in the mood for a game of footsie

401
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}or hoofsie or pawsie or...

402
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That wasn't my paw. It was this!

403
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I didn't steal it. I borrowed it.

404
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It'll light the way to Ryan.

405
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,320


406
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,060


407
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The walls are moving.

408
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right, right. The walls...

409
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The walls are moving!

410
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Larry, hold your breath!

411
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Larry, stay straight!

412
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Everybody out!

413
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, don't panic. What we've got to do...

414
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is definitely not good. Samson!

415
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Give me your hoof! -Help!

416
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Larry!

417
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The garbage! It lives!

418
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,150


419
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys?

420
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK, anybody? I'm freakin' out.

421
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What's the hold up? -Hello?

422
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're over here, Nigel.

423
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right. I'll be there in a minute.

424
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Think. What did Benny say?

425
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Couple of lefts, couple of rights.

426
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bridget, can you see the green lady?

427
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm looking, I'm looking,

428
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but I can't see over anything for a change.

429
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How far are you away? You in a different continent?

430
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is that you, Larry?

431
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Up here, Nige.

432
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're a very furry snake.

433
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys... We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.

434
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dogs. This should be fun for you, Samson.

435
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nigel! Grab Bridget!

436
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What? -Run!

437
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

438
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?

439
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All part of the plan. This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.

440
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.

441
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What next?

442
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Page 11?

443
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go on, you mutts!

444
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.

445
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Taken you to a... To a disco!

446
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Larry, improvise!

447
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Larry, that's not helping. -OK.

448
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You dogs think you got bark? Well, Samson's got roar!

449
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Show 'em, Sam. -Dig deep, Samson.

450
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're a lion. Be a lion.

451
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at that guy!

452
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.

453
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK...

454
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Larry, coil! -Check!

455
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Sam! -I improvised. Now jump!

456
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Down there? -Yes!

457
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're leaving, Larry!

458
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Teensy question, Samson. With those dogs up there,

459
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?

460
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, lionize 'em or lionate them

461
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}or lionify them?

462
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.

463
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We have to find Ryan, remember?

464
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is this stinky place?

465
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Lt...

466
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}...appears to be a human bathing area.

467
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?

468
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Disgusting!

469
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're hopeless. It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.

470
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.

471
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No hurry, but is there a plan?

472
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course there's a plan.

473
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We follow this water to the big water,

474
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and then we find the lady with...

475
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.

476
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wasn't me.

477
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

478
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Smooth move, Nigel! -Oh, boy! Twins!

479
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys

480
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}are seeming to have acid reflux or something!

481
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Everybody... stay calm.

482
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Calm? -Not good.

483
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yo. Boo!

484
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here

485
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}are a little far from your borough.

486
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Far from your borough! I love it.

487
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're going to the big water.

488
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nigel, show them what we're looking for.

489
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Like this? -I think it's in her right hand.

490
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-And isn't she blue? -I can't do blue.

491
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-No idea. You? -Doesn't even register.

492
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-You're battin' zero, kid. -Do the thing with...

493
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Make your bloody mind up.

494
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The big female with the spikes on her melon!

495
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're tourists.

496
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, tourists, listen up. Ya gotta get to Battery Park.

497
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}First take the Broadway culvert.

498
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Down the Broadway culvert? -What's wrong with that?

499
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-They get lost at the sewage plant! -Get outta here!

500
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What are you talking about? -How would you send 'em?

501
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!

502
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.

503
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-That is true. -All right.

504
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys, you gonna help or not?

505
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure. Of course we're gonna help ya's.

506
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're one big family, right?

507
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Except for that guy there. He scares the...

508
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine? Are ya?

509
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I apologize. He never got over being flushed down the toilet.

510
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

511
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.

512
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a jungle down here.

513
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Stan, you know who that is? -What? No.

514
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!

515
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How ya doing?

516
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm so cuddly! I like you!

517
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've seen a lot of those things floatin' here in the sewer.

518
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's good! You're makin' me laugh over here.

519
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just wait for me!

520
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are we in the right place?

521
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Any place without two hilarious alligators

522
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}seems a move in the right direction.

523
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Sam, do you see anything up there? -I sure do.

524
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, well, well. There she is, like Hamir said.

525
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.

526
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys, look. We know the box Ryan's in is green.

527
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...

528
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. So we should shout out if we see a box

529
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that looks like the ones over there.

530
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It hasn't left yet! We can make it!

531
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Let's go! -Hold on, Larry!

532
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Which way now? -Yeah, which way?

533
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Run!

534
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No!

535
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No!

536
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ryan's on that thing!

537
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We've got to stop it!

538
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-We can't, Sam! -I don't care!

539
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-No, Sammy, you'll drown! -Sam!

540
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I failed. Again.

541
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I only count one failure.

542
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's big, but it's just one.

543
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Ryan. We're gonna miss ya.

544
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Samson! -What on earth is going on?

545
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.

546
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.

547
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

548
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great! One problem down...

549
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Far out.

550
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Cool.

551
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One disaster to go.

552
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you doing? We're headed for the other boat!

553
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How do we steer? Who knows how to steer?

554
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}None of us. We're animals. Great!

555
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Hold on, Larry. Do that again. -Do what?

556
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whatever you just did, but the opposite!

557
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I don't know my opposites!

558
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, Larry, like this!

559
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think I've got it.

560
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that was easy.

561
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, dear. Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?

562
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This isn't so difficult.

563
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm the lion of the sea!

564
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well done, sir.

565
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.

566
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're brilliant.

567
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee,

568
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.

569
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What, nothing? -Nothing. He's gone.

570
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No.

571
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There! Nelson! The green boxes!

00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}not this olfactory insult.

668
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I...

669
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since,

670
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you know, I haven't eaten for a while.

671
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Exactly!

672
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.

673
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excellent. Fantastic!

674
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We get to see the legend in action.

675
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'd love to, but we just don't have time.

676
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We got the time, Sammy. Just...

677
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And then you do this. And then this bit.

678
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rip him apart!

679
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The horror.

680
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can't bear to watch! But I have to.

681
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go on. Get out of here.

682
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-The legend dropped his dinner. -Oh, boy.

683
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's wrong? I'm not good enough for you to eat?

684
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. It's just I'm allergic to nuts.

685
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now I get it. You're gonna toy with me?

686
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?

687
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How exciting.

688
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, guys. Ryan can't be far.

689
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! I'm not finished with you! I am a delicacy.

690
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My flesh has fruity wood notes!

691
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre. That's Samson the Wild.

692
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You call this wild?

693
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is a cat! A big, fat, tame pussycat!

694
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-OK, that's enough! -The pussycat hissed at me!

695
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.

696
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?

697
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. What are you, a twit?

698
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Ignore him. -Don't bother! I'm leaving.

699
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-You're weird. -Run for your lives!

700
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a lion with moral issues!

701
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I've had it with you too!

702
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!

703
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,410


704
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Teensy question.

705
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Or more like a... a sort of a query meets a statement.

706
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That hyrax back there?

707
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.

708
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, and what about those dogs? There was no munching there, either.

709
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...

710
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-A vegetarian? -Nope.

711
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-That's not what I was going to say. -You were going to say...

712
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-It's almost like... -You're not from...

713
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The wild?

714
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you're right. I'm not from the wild.

715
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

716
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just a phony.

717
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Truth is I can't protect you out here.

718
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Please just go back to the boat.

719
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got to find my son.

720
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.

721
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.

722
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So that means...

723
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We are going to die!

724
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, guys! Guys!

725
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will the three of you calm down?

726
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How could he lie to us?

727
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-We're his best friends. -Sure.

728
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.

729
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK, yeah, whatever. Whatever.

730
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's just go back to the boat, then.

731
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The fierce, the proud, the wild... Rubbish!

732
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Where you goin'?

733
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop right there! Stop!

734
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bridget, if you go, I'm...

735
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm breaking up with you.

736
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We were never going out in the first place.

737
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then we're taking a break.

738
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Nigel! -All right!

739
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, listen!

740
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know you're scared. But at least we got each other.

741
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sammy's got nobody. He's out there all alone.

742
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And... so is Ryan.

743
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}OK, OK, focus, Samson.

744
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's got to be out there somewhere. You'll find him.

745
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?

746
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ryan!

747
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey there, little fella. You're lost too, huh?

748
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You remind me of my buddy back home.

749
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A bloodthirsty monster!

750
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where? Where?

751
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's a killer! Get away from my baby!

752
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Calm down, lady!

753
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Won't anyone save my baby?

754
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bye-bye.

755
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ryan! Ryan!

756
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sammy!

757
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wasn't meant for the wild.

758
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was made to nibble and be elegant

759
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and to appear in children's books as the letter G.

760
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,110

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait! What? What? Wait!

952
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Hey!

953
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:27,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get off me!

954
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is goin' on here?

955
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:34,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Stinky does not speak. -It rolls like a little ball.

956
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait. You guys think I'm a...?

957
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Achtung, Stinky! -Less talk, more roll.

958
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:41,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Ja. -Roll! Roll!

959
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What the...? Hey!

960
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!

961
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll give you something to roll about!

962
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!

963
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bridget? Larry! They're gone.

964
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I gotta find them!

965
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No! I gotta find Samson first!

966
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No! First...

967
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sam. Sam!

968
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bridget! Larry!

969
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, Ryan! You're alive!

970
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good to see you guys.

971
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Where's my hug? -Larry.

972
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-There it is. -It's good to see you too.

973
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you guys doing here?

974
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We came here with your father to find you.

975
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:43,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.

976
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wish he were.

977
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.

978
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What? -What?

979
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't think he made it. I don't see how he could.

980
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, Ryan.

981
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I got you into this.

982
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.

983
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's this? Where's the other lion?

984
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right. Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...

985
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why are you looking at me like that?

986
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!

987
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You klutz.

988
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain

989
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}until we eat a lion!

990
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.

991
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What about the rest of us?

992
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Step-kick, pivot-kick!

993
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ouch! I twisted a hoof!

994
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You work and you work. Then they break your heart.

995
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-There goes my career! -Prepare the sacrifices!

996
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why did I let him go off by himself?

997
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.

998
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bet I could catch you.

999
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Please.

1000
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My natural predator is fuel inject... What?

1001
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I knew you weren't really gone. I knew it!

1002
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, I knew it! We're still buddies, right?

1003
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I lost Ryan.

1004
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There were too many. They just took him.

1005
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who? Who took him?

1006
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:25,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Wildebeests. -The freaks with the hooves!

1007
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They got Larry and Bridget too.

1008
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Couldn't fight, couldn't...

1009
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, Sam. You're a lion.

1010
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You come from a long line of kings.

1011
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.

1012
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But fighting's in your blood!

1013
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:42,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. I'll never be a real lion.

1014
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wrong! You are a real lion.

1015
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Doesn't matter where you're from:

1016
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.

1017
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's what's in here.

1018
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That determines who you are!

1019
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:56,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}At least, that's what you always told your son.

1020
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now he's out there, Sammy,

1021
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and he needs you.

1022
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?

1023
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:10,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's it, Sammy.

1024
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's it.

1025
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go find my son... and my friends.

1026
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah! Nothing's gonna stop us!

1027
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Except that we have no idea where we're going!

1028
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Follow your instincts.

1029
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Follow your instincts.

1030
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:41,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-What is that? -My... instincts?

1031
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Benny? -You're almost there.

1032
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That settles it, then.

1033
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.

1034
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Benny, look.

1035
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:58,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The freaks with hooves!

1036
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ryan's in there.

1037
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can't just barge in. That's suicide!

1038
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Benny, get out of my way! -Don't listen to the rat.

1039
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:10,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Hey, who are you calling a rat? -You, of course.

1040
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-You'll give away our position. -I'll have you written up for that!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fool! You blew our cover! Men! Scatter!

1042
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not so fast!

1043
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look who I got, Sammy. It's your lion instincts.

1044
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who are you guys?

1045

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Our names aren't important. -I'm Cloak. He's Camo.

1046
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-We're covert agents. -Why have you been leading me around?

1047
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-That's classified. -Top-secret.

1048
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-The wildebeests have gone mad. -Cloak.

1049
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...

1050
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?

1051
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-That's need-to-know. -They did.

1052
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-They think the koala's a god. -You're the worst covert agent!

1053
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Then why can I do this? Men!

1054
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,880

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Idiot! That maneuver's confidential. -It's secret. This one's confidential.

1056
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Cloak! -And this one's restricted.

1057
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:03,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Super-secret. Top-secret. This is ultra-secret!

1058
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Enough! No more!

1059
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:08,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!

1060
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No!

1061

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got an idea.

1062
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who is this Great Him, anyway? I'll take him on.

1063
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm the Great Her! I'll show Him a thing or two.

1064
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.

1065
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

1066
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You have got to be kidding me.

1067
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,

1068
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-but I will kick your... -Silence!

1069

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why, you little...

1070
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Silence, again!

1071
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You do not speak to me!

1072
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nigel, what's the deal?

1073
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?

1074
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, we shall! What's on the menu?

1075
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Them.

1076
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

1077
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...

1078
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}God, friends, god, friends. God, I...

1079
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that was subtle.

1080
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Prepare the meat fire!

1081
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait!

1082
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We cannot cook them without...

1083
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}...onion!

1084

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Onions. Onions. Onions.

1085
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that was fast.

1086
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let the ritual begin.

1087
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Move it!

1088
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am so mad at you!

1089
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait! We also need... hats!

1090
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do we not have the party hats of death?

1091
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got mine!

1092
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:11,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And before the feast, we must all...

1093
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What the...?

1094
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}...levitate...

1095
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}...and spin uncontrollably!

1096
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And feel a bit sick.

1097
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How do I stop this thing?

1098
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Guys. -Benny?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great Him, it's another miracle!

1108
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You've delivered us a real lion!

1109
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Blag, your luck has turned.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whack, whack, whack!

1120
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Dad! -What? Ryan!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.

1123
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:00,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-Stay close. -Prey has become predator!

1124

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And predator has become prey!

1125
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And the hoof finally trumps the claw!

1126
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, Dad! Let's show these turkey-jerkies

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's eat the brat first.

1129
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Over my dead body!

1130
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1131

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!

1133
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why don't we use the secret play?

1134
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know. Shut up, Larry. That's stupid.

1135

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No! It's brilliant!

1136
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:54,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.

1137
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But look who's laughing now!
