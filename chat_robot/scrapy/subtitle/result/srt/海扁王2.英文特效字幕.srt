00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely not. No.

00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, if you don't wanna do it,

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

8
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn! I'm alive.

11
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready to go again?

12
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely not.

13
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

14
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't just say "fine"

15
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then shoot me in the chest.

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause it's not cool.

17
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like at all.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

19
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:43,013

00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always wondered

21
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why no one tried to be a superhero before me.

22
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It turns out somebody had.

23
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy Macready.

24
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After her dad died, his old partner on the force,

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus, became her guardian.

26
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a Pink Pony bag she's wearing? Nice backpack.

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

28
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steal it from a six year old?

29
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus dropped her off every day.

30
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But as soon as he was gone, so was she.

31
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one at school found out

32
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because she hacked into the server

33
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and gave herself the award for perfect attendance.

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit Girl and Big Daddy had been the real deal.

35
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy was gonna keep wearing the mask

36
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as long as there were criminals to take down.

37
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no matter how many drug dealers she stopped,

38
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she couldn't stop feeling alone.

39
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? I'd given up being a superhero

40
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it was way too dangerous.

41
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only problem, I was dying of boredom.

42
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like most high school seniors,

43
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

44
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, I didn't know what channel I wanted to watch.

45
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just TV, Dave, not peace in the Middle East.

46
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My best friends Todd and Marty

47
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had no clue I was the first superhero to go public.

48
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys watch Spider-Man last night?

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it weird that Aunt May gets me kinda hard?

50
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not if you're a granny-slammer.

51
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They may wear costumes, but it isn't Halloween.

52
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're real life superheroes,

53
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and in the two years since the first ordinary citizens

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}donned capes and masks,

55
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the movement has started to spread.

56
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I became a superhero because of Kick-Ass.

57
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you just come home from work,

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you grab your gear and you go out on patrol.

59
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help us make the streets safe.

60
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I inspired all those people to get off their asses,

61
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now I was stuck on mine.

62
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that night after dinner,

63
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:28,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided to get my old costume out.

64
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry.  - Can't you knock?

65
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:33,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, buddy,

66
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's perfectly normal for you to touch yourself...

67
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Jesus, Dad. Get out!

68
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I was even thinking about a Kick-Ass sequel,

69
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to get serious.

70
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, can we chat?

71
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, Mindy?

72
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in the cab. Meters running.

73
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna team up like Batman and Robin.

74
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody wants to be Robin.

75
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong with Robin?

76
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weren't you like Big Daddy's Robin?

77
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robin wishes he was me.

78
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I'm trying to say is we should be partners,

79
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you and me, like the dynamic duo.

80
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in the NFL, Dave. You play pee-wee.

81
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So? Train me.

82
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna walk the walk,

83
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're the closest thing I know to a real superhero.

84
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you tired of being on your own?

85
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you wanna know someone's there for you?

86
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone who's got your back?

87
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you'll do anything I say?

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything.

89
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit me.

90
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a 15-year-old girl.

91
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell?

92
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Act like a bitch, get slapped like a bitch.

93
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, goddamn.

94
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy beat me like morning wood every day for three weeks.

95
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Guard up! Left, right, guard up!

96
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with my damaged nerve endings,

97
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it hurt like hell.

98
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, in a weird way, I kinda liked it.

99
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It gave me a sense of purpose.

100
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What happened to your face? - Nothing.

101
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like we were driving towards something.

102
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn!

103
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's amazing!

104
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the other people putting on masks

105
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were just playing superhero.

106
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were training to really do it.

107
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't tell my girlfriend Katie,

108
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or Marty and Todd.

109
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I didn't care. We were having too much fun.

110
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left, right, left!

111
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our own superhero team.

112
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was gonna be balls.

113
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell, Mom?

114
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you delete the news off the DVR?

115
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes, I did, Christopher.

116
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was the one with Kick-Ass.

117
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Christopher,

118
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've gotta stop obsessing over this superhero.

119
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is not a superhero, Mom, he's a murderer.

120
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He blew up Dad with a bazooka, for fuck's sake!

121
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father died in a fire.

122
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A fire? What is your problem?

123
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You! You are my problem!

124
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am trying to raise you to be a normal boy!

125
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we moved to Long Island

126
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after your father's accident.

127
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bazooka is not an accident,

128
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you delusional bitch!

129
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This conversation is over.

130
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Then I'm leaving.

131
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Javier, be cool.

132
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Chris, but your mom pays me not to be cool.

133
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate you!

134
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You home-school me like I'm a prisoner!

135
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You threw away my Red Mist costume.

136
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! I am not the problem! You are!

137
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you were dead!

138
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy?

139
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch that.

140
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry. What is it?

141
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a last resort.

142
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like if all else fails and you're about to die.

143
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you not scared to die?

144
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you scared you're never gonna grow into your big boy pants?

145
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious.

146
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if Spider-Man or Batman got killed one night?

147
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It could happen.

148
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're scared of dying,

149
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one thing is certain,

150
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you are going to die.

151
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My daddy was never afraid of dying.

152
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look where that got him.

153
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knew he might have to make the ultimate sacrifice one day.

154
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's why he made me promise

155
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd never stop defending this city.

156
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cross my heart,

157
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hope to die.

158
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad was insane. You know that, right?

159
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're wrong, Dave.

160
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My daddy was the first real superhero,

161
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not you or Red Mist. It was my daddy,

162
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was an honor to serve by his side.

163
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Min, how was school?

164
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Super crazy.

165
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Mullins was out today,

166
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we had Mr. Cooper leaching us biology, such a grump.

167
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? That's weird

168
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:46,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because Principal Himoff called me yesterday.

169
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were supposed to get an award for perfect attendance,

170
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you didn't attend.

171
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I followed you this morning.

172
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Saw you get into a cab with some boy,

173
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I lost you guys over the bridge.

174
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now you wanna tell me where you really were today?

175
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really sorry, Marcus.

176
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't wanna make you mad.

177
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut the waterworks, Min. You're 15, not five.

178
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

179
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, he asked me to cut class and go lo the mall.

180
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, yeah, yeah, I did.

181
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has nothing to do with you being Hit Girl?

182
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna find any ninja blades

183
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or throwing stars under your bed?

184
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I just wanted him to like me. Okay?

185
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie, skipping school's not a way to get boys to like you.

186
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so stupid.

187
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're one of the smartest little girls I know.

188
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go get some pizza.

189
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, you mean I'm not grounded?

190
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, just consider this a warning.

191
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you sure you wanna give all your mom's things away?

192
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell am I supposed to do with all her stuff?

193
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn, she had a nice pair of guns.

194
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, she's dead! Don't talk about her tits.

195
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was talking about these.

196
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, those. Those were my dad's.

197
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you keep them?

198
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure?

199
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I mean, they belong to you, right?

200
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Chris. You're your own man now.

201
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just be careful, all right? - Yeah.

202
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Definitely don't wanna keep those!

203
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take care of it.

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take the day off. Later.

205
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, are you ready for your first field test?

206
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I supposed to do with these?

207
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put them on and, uh, go fishing.

208
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the whitest pimp ever.

209
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the idea.

210
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the next right. Comes out on Flatbush.

211
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure I should be doing this without my gear?

212
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the point.

213
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass isn't a costume.

214
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass is who you really are.

215
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave Lizewski is the mask.

216
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, my "mask" is about to get his teeth kicked in.

217
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, queer bait,

218
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where are you going with those bags, man?

219
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him you're on your way to fuck his mother with a 12-inch strap on.

220
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just taking a walk.

221
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This really isn't what I do.

222
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I usually just call the cops.

223
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you talking to, man?

224
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, I'm just on a call. It was...

225
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, service round here, it sucks, man.

226
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now give me the bags, faggot,

227
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before I make you suck my fat cock, huh?

228
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

229
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

230
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you believe I let Mindy beat the snot out of me for weeks

231
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just so I could get my ass kicked again?

232
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much for a team.

233
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ready to die? You faggot!

234
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, all that homophobic shit

235
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}makes you sound super gay.

236
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I ever catch you robbing again, shit-burger,

237
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia on your ass and cut your hand off.

238
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promise me you're done with your life of crime.

239
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

240
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pants on fire.

241
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you think? - I think you almost got me killed!

242
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. What do you think of my line?

243
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Pants on fire." I wrote a whole bunch of 'em.

244
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run! I'll tell them you saved me. Go!

245
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Female suspect fleeing Flatbush.

246
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Under 5 feet. Masked.

247
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Armed with nunchucks and a sword.

248
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Min. - Hey, Marcus. What's up?

249
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you answered your phone.

250
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means you're not in school.

251
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was,

252
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I wasn't feeling so good,

253
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and so the nurse decided to send me home.

254
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor thing. Well, I'm almost home.

255
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make soup and we can watch Jeopardy!

256
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All righty. I'll see you soon, okay?

257
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

258
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

259
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got my soup?

260
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me take your temperature first.

261
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you're really clammy.

262
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll feel better after a nap-nap.

263
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close your eyes. I'm gonna get you that soup.

264
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that blood?

265
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it, Mindy. I can't do this anymore.

266
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father was like a brother to me.

267
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a great cop and a hero.

268
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Big Daddy? That was not your father, okay?

269
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was someone who robbed you of your childhood.

270
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this?

271
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit Girl? That's not who you are.

272
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are Mindy Macready

273
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:47,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're just starting high school.

274
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand that you don't know who that person is yet,

275
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you will, you've just gotta try.

276
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to.

277
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what you want.

278
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't. You're not an adult, not yet.

279
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years

280
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than most adults have in their lifetime.

281
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That note that your father gave you,

282
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the one that you were supposed to open

283
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:08,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if anything ever happened.

284
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did it say?

285
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you would take care of me.

286
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that you were supposed to listen to me, right?

287
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, listen up.

288
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you in school.

289
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to stop talking to that boy.

290
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want you to promise me

291
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this is never gonna happen again.

292
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cross my heart,

293
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hope to die.

294
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

295
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy!

296
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell?

297
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First you almost get me killed, then you stand me up.

298
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, I'm sorry.

299
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I... You are?

300
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am.

301
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For everything.

302
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, okay, great.

303
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, "apologetic" isn't a word I'd use to describe you.

304
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many times do I have to say it?

305
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, let's get out of here.

306
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta ease up. I think I might have broken a rib.

307
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, I'm done.

308
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With training?

309
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With everything.

310
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, you mean everything?

311
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't. You're Hit Girl.

312
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were gonna start a team, you can't just quit.

313
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is who you are.

314
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not anymore, Dave.

315
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, but it's over. I'm done.

316
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just broke up with him?

317
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just leave me alone.

318
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you stop apologizing?

319
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what's worse,

320
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're fucking a 9th-grader

321
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or that you just got dumped by one.

322
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:58,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pedophile freak.

323
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not like that

324
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what is it like? Please, tell me.

325
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't. It's to do with the Kick-Ass thing.

326
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a secret for you.

327
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember Malik?

328
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude who volunteers at your needle exchange?

329
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His baton is so much bigger than Kick-Ass'.

330
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No.    - Yeah.

331
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by "baton," I mean penis.

332
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

333
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifteen gets you 20, pervert.

334
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A freshman, Dave? You old, salty dog.

335
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the problem?

336
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grass on the field, play ball. Right?

337
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Todd.

338
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, your tutor's here.

339
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:34,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris!

340
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, your...

341
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit. What the hell is that?

342
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My destiny.

343
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, just because your mom liked to get a little freaky now.

344
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what my role is in this, Javier.

345
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad was a crime boss, so it just makes sense.

346
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a supervillain. It's evolution.

347
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on.

348
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just put those things down before you hurt somebody, Chris.

349
00:18:58,838 --> 00:18:59,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not my name.

350
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay. Uh, Red Mist...

351
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red Mist was my superhero name.

352
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henceforth I'll be known as

353
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Motherfucker.

354
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After Mindy quit,

355
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided to stop hitting the heavy bag

356
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:16,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and start hitting the streets.

357
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Kick-Ass, welcome back!

358
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the best, man!

359
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only problem, I was still on my own.

360
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I went online and found a physics professor

361
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}calling himself "Dr. Gravity."

362
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl,

363
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I had to start somewhere.

364
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the zero G device that I invented.

365
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can levitate any object up to a ton.

366
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For real?

367
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, no, man. This is a baseball bat wrapped in tinfoil.

368
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it fooled you.

369
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, could I get a Diet Mountain Dew, please?

370
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not even a physics professor.

371
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a copywriter for an ad agency.

372
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's why I love this stuff.

373
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can be anyone you want!

374
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You done many team-ups before?

375
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of. Yeah. No, not really.

376
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was getting kinda nervous about being on my own, you know?

377
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, me, too. I never even been in a fight.

378
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, hopefully you won't have to.

379
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I friended a guy talking about forming a team,

380
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you're interested.

381
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how serious he is,

382
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but his picture was pretty hard core.

383
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me? That's why I contacted you.

384
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't wanna freak you out by bringing it up too soon.

385
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show you his profile after I hit the men's room.

386
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Uncle Ralph's not gonna be happy about this, Chris.

387
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not my name.

388
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not calling you that, forget it.

389
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Javier, you worked for my dad.

390
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you worked for my mom. Now you work for me.

391
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm probably the richest kid in New York City.

392
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you don't like that,

393
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}find yourself another motherfucking job, okay?

394
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Kick-Ass!

395
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, am I glad to see you.

396
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there anything I can do to help, sir?

397
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I was hoping you can help me

398
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get a million hits on YouTube.

399
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:00,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Come on.

400
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God!

401
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, Kick-Ass, run!

402
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jersey Shore motherfucker!

403
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what, you not interested in a fair fight?

404
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is no fair fight.

405
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Team meeting tomorrow.

406
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll e-mail you the address.

407
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beware Dr. Gravity!

408
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had to admire the Doctor's enthusiasm.

409
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't wait to meet his friends.

410
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hands in the air, Spring Roll.

00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go.

514
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we were gonna go and get high on bath salts at Logan's house.

515
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy, I wanna give you a chance

516
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the rest of the girls in our class would kill for.

517
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you wanna walk out the door every day

518
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in skin-tight clothes

519
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}knowing that everyone warships you?

520
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you wanna sneak out at night,

521
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:02,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}raise a little hell,

522
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and show the world what a strong,

523
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}independent woman is capable of?

524
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you wanna belong?

525
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:13,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# So you know that I'll carry you #

526
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I wear this to Logan's?

527
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be so much fun.

528
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we tried the cops and tried the newspapers,

529
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and even set up a, you know, a thing on the Internet

530
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for people to help us find Tommy.

531
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we got nothing.

532
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never saw our son again.

533
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came up with the name Remembering Tommy,

534
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, uh, we've been doing this three nights a week. So...

535
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Colonel Stars and Stripes found us online.

536
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's terrible, guys. I'm real sorry.

537
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I became Night Bitch

538
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:54,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after my sister was murdered and found in a dumpster.

539
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

540
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't bring her back,

541
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but at least I'm doing something positive about it.

542
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insect Man.

543
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been bullied my whole life for being gay,

544
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so now I stand up for the defenseless.

545
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I don't wear a mask.

546
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too much like being back in the closet.

547
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long as your heart's in the right place,

548
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we don't care what you put in your mouth.

549
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fist bump. - Thank you. Thank you, sir.

550
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I became Battle Guy

551
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after my parents were mugged and killed coming home from the opera.

552
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I tell you that sick bastard

553
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maxed out their credit cards on porno sites?

554
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope we get the chance to say hello to this guy someday

555
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I can personally levitate his soul from his body.

556
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Marty?

557
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I knew I recognized your voice.

558
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't know what you're talking about.

559
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know no Marty. New guy.

560
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, asshole, it's me, Dave.

561
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:49,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave? Why are you dressed like Kick-Ass?

562
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm Kick-Ass.

563
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two know each other?

564
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like since we were five.

565
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's all this bullshit about your parents getting killed?

566
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeesh, language. What?

567
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Battle Guy, care to update your resume?

568
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to figure out how to explain this

569
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without sounding like a complete idiot right now.

570
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm not sure that's possible, Batman.

571
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not, either.

572
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Well, when I found you guys online,

573
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you were all swapping these awesome origin stories.

574
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Colonel, you're ex-Mafia, for Christ's sake.

575
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:25,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

576
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

577
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't think you'd let me join the team

578
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unless I had a good story, too.

579
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, we'll let you off the hook this time,

580
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:36,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Battle Guy.

581
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna see something cool?

582
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought this could be our meeting room.

583
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, this is so cool.

584
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this little renovation was totally clandestine,

585
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which means nobody knew about it.

586
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I know it's not much,

587
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this is just the beginning.

588
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Together we can make a real difference.

589
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you'd consider it, Kick-Ass,

590
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'd be honored to have you join us.

591
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, yeah!

592
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I like to hear.

593
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, time for initiation.

594
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn around and I'll unzip you.

595
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, what?

596
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just joking. Let's get down to business.

597
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha.

598
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are.

599
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We saved you a seat in the caf, but you never showed.

600
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I usually head over to the Olive Garden to carb load.

601
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't had white sugar since my first birthday.

602
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we need a thintervention?

603
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, best way to tighten up a tummy

604
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:35,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is varsity dance team.

605
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sign-up sheet just went up.

606
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's still blowing my mind. Kick-Ass.

607
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like finding out your best friend's

608
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}always been Will Smith, you know?

609
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, guys. What are you talking about?

610
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

611
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nothing? - Yeah, Todd, nothing.

612
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. See you around, guys.

613
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd, wait.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Justice Forever!

717
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were in the ultimate clique.

718
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't matter that no one else knew.

719
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We knew. And we felt like rock stars.

720
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, guys. Nice job. Battle Guy.

721
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night, Colonel. Thanks for everything.

722
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, son, thank you.

723
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,025
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You showed us that every man can make a difference.

724
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without Kick-Ass, none of us would be here.

725
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's from the heart. Don't let it go to your head.

726
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not really that tired.

727
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

728
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's leave the masks on.

729
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

730
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

731
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First big mission's tonight

732
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's not community service.

733
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're taking on some real bad guys.

734
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, can't your team handle it?

735
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not you, Mindy.

736
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remembering Tommy owns a dry fruit business.

737
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night Bitch teaches ballet.

738
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night Bitch?

739
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is she? A superhero or a soft core porno?

740
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe a little bit of both.

741
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God, you're plugging her?

742
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna vom.

743
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're like a ninja.

744
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:11,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't you just sneak out after Marcus goes to sleep?

745
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't get it, Dave.

746
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made a promise to Marcus.

747
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So break it. You're a superhero, remember?

748
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy Macready's just a disguise.

749
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, I don't know what kind of superhero Night Whore is,

750
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if you really think I'd ever break my word,

751
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you obviously have no idea who I am.

752
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that making dance team

753
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't make you stop being who you are.

754
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know Hit Girl couldn't give a shit

755
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about what high school girls are into.

756
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that you wouldn't go on a date

757
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:40,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if your life depended on it.

758
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:41,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to hell, Dave.

759
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You know I'm right.

760
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roid Rage.

761
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

762
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna take me on a date sometime?

763
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, yeah. Sure.

764
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's, um, Simon.

765
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great, um, Simon.

766
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a date.

767
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy, I'm sorry.

768
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there a problem, Min?

769
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:05,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zero.

770
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Because I don't like problems.

771
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, you been sneaking out at night?

772
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Neipert said

773
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she thought she saw you leaving at 2:00 in the morning.

774
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Neipert's crazy, Dad.

775
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She tried to teach her dog Spanish.

776
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you on drugs?

777
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously?

778
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta ask.

779
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my best bud and you're growing up so fast.

780
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promise me you're not doing anything foolish?

781
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I promise.

782
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good enough for me, pal.

783
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're too smart to do anything stupid.

784
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Justice Forever!

785
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad you got that out of your system.

786
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:53,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Todd texted me. Again. What a loser.

787
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, how bad-ass is Colonel Stars and Stripes?

788
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I still can't believe he's an ex-mob enforcer.

789
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, how do you go from that to being a superhero?

790
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a born-again Christian.

791
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up.

792
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's hope he can handle tonight.

793
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess we're about to find out.

794
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the rest of the team?

795
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Gravity has the flu,

796
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Remembering Tommy got Book of Mormon tickets, so...

797
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay.

798
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five of us should do.

799
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you say this guy made his money, sir? Prostitution?

800
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not just girls. Kids.

801
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:37,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ships them in from villages back home.

802
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boneheads in blue take a blind eye.

803
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know he's here tonight?

804
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because Thursday night is poker night.

805
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same five low-lifes every week.

806
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man with a habit ain't hard to find.

807
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what's the plan? Are we sneaking in?

808
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we'd knock.

809
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - It's more polite.

810
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay frosty, team.

811
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to eat punks like this for breakfast.

812
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jehovah's Witness!

813
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:08,693


814
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:10,600


815
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:14,257


816
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:16,832


817
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I just zoned out for a second.

818
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say that we're going up against five gangsters?

819
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And bouncer makes six.

820
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And three-quarters.

821
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck do you want?

822
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening, young man. We'd like a word with Jimmy Kim.

823
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's not too inconvenient

824
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the fuck out of here

825
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:43,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before I tear your head off, you old fuck.

826
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:45,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

827
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're in trouble.

828
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't understand why people feel the need

829
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to use that kind of language.

830
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he goes.

831
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sweet Jesus.

832

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Battle Guy,

833
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what did I tell you about taking the Lord's name in vain?

834
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, sir.

835
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eisenhower, at the ready.

836
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insect Man, I want you right behind me.

837
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody else spread out, catch the strays.

838
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And try to have fun,

839
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}otherwise what's the point?

840
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice party. Anybody wanna dance?

841
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

842
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very nice. Behind you!

843
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch the birdie.

844
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you move.

845
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night Bitch! Behind you!

00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you shouldn't talk with your mouth full.

850
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very rude. Come on.

856
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are the girls?

857
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man. I've got a heart problem.

858
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah?

859
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

860
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want me to solve that for you?

861
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. The girls are upstairs in the apartments.

862
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My little brother, he's on the till-

863
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just a college kid.

864
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kick-Ass, Night Bitch. - On it.

866
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It hurts!

867
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, there's a dog on your balls.

868
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want money? There's 50 grand on the table.

869
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please just make him stop! Please!

870
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you can buy us? Is that what you think?

871
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not here to steal from you.

872
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:38,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're here to send a message to all the other bottom-dwellers.

873
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're shutting you down. - Come on.

874
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a van waiting outside from a battered women's shelter.

875
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll take you some place safe.

876
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go. Go. - We really can't leave.

877
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have no money.

878
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Battle Guy, how much they have on the table?

879
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's like 50 grand.

880
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got plenty now.

881
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

882
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:11,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job, guys.

883
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very tidy. Very tidy.

884
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe you pulled a gun on that guy.

885
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you really gonna shoot him?

886
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let you in on a little secret.

887
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Empty. Don't tell the bad guys.

888
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon my language, Colonel,

889
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:29,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you have got some serious balls.

890
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly more than Mr. Kim.

891
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"There's a dog on my balls."

892
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn it.

893
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Javier! - What happened?

894
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some douche just posted a link to a story about a whorehouse,

895
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}says that Kick-Ass' team took them out.

896
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell? Where's my crew?

897
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, everybody's just...

898
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, can you ladies excuse us for a second?

899
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, no, they're my sidekicks.

900
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can listen to what we have to say.

901
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not your sidekicks, Chris.

902
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're prostitutes and witnesses, come on.

903
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Sorry, no offense.

904
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody's just too afraid of your Uncle Ralph

905
00:46:05,073 --> 00:46:05,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to take the job.

906
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's in prison.

907
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't matter. He runs the family now.

908
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he wants everybody to lay low.

909
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:12,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, fortunately for you,

910
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big Tony doesn't know how to lay low, so he's in.

911
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't remember a Big Tony. Is he huge? - He's ironic.

912
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}5 foot 4, but mean as shit.

913
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's go! such a hard-on for killing people.

914
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's little and he kills. - Right.

915
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call him "The Tumor,"

916
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's next?

917
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, we've got an ex-Triad member looking for work.

918
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, "Genghis Carnage." Come on.

919
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta quit with the racist stereotypes, Chris.

920
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Archetypes. Keep going.

921
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:48,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got, uh, Katarina Dumbrovski.

922
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:49,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait. A chick?

923
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

924
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, you hired a chick?

925
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:53,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Former KGB.

926
00:46:53,884 --> 00:46:57,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was locked up in the Gulag until she ate her eel/mate.

927
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. "Mother Russia."

928
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother Russia and Motherfucker both on the same team?

929
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't work, Chris.

930
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not asking for suggestions, asshole.

931
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get them costumes and get them ready!

932
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

933
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Javier, thank you.

934
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't do this without you.

935
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:20,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're pretty much like the only real family I have left.

936
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a problem, man. I got your back.

937
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kinda like you're the Alfred to my evil Bruce Wayne.

938
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just call me your fucking butler?

939
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, is that not a compliment?

940
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. My bad.

941
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There wasn't much action most nights.

942
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, there was always a little action with Night Bitch.

943
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:49,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The reality of being a superhero is lots of patrols.

944
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:53,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that didn't stop people from begging to join up.

945
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all our new members,

946
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it seemed kinda shitty not to ask Todd.

947
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop peeking, man, you're gonna ruin it.

948
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out.

949
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't fight crime in that

950
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:12,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your pants are so tight, you got frog-eye.

951
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell's "frog-eye"?

952
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Male camel toe.  - What?

953
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not really sure about these names, either.

954
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:20,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Whup-Ass," "Kick-Ass-Man."

955
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dr. Kick-Ass"? Yeah.

956
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, they all kinda seem derivative.

957
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me translate that.

958
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't just copy Dave's name, you knob-gobbler.

959
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

960
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wait. Oh, I got it.

961
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it. I got it.

962
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Ass Kicker"

963
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously?

964
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're such a dick, Marty.

965
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know this is why you guys aren't texting me back,

966
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not an actual idiot.

967
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you could have fooled me, Ass-Licker.

968
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:53,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. well, screw you guys. - Todd...

969
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, really. Fuck you guys.

970
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go find my own team.

971
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd. Wait. Come on.

972
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd was right, we were being dicks.

973
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:04,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the truth is,

974
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:08,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the only person I really wanted on the team was Mindy,

975
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but she was too busy trying not to be a superhero.

976
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Min, he's here.

977
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your first big date. How are you feeling?

978
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like the first time Big Daddy sent me into

979
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:28,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a crack den with nothing but a penknife.

980
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got some butterflies.

981
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just be yourself and you let me be nervous.

982
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about me.

983
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:39,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can kill a man with his own finger.

984
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A word of advice, I wouldn't open with that.

985
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for letting me finally take you out.

986
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how else was I gonna get you to stop calling?

987
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - You're welcome.

988
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:10,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going?

989
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To a party.

990
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is this party in the middle of nowhere?

991
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because that's where keg parties usually are, right?

992
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess we're the first ones here.

993
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't where you have a party, moron.

994
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is where you dump a dead body.

995
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your problem?

996
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

997
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll stop being such a bitch.

998
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You actually seem like a nice guy.

999
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, um...

1000
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna hook up?

1001
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a total idiot.

1002
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Simon, get back in the car.

1003
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

1004
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yay, you made it.

1005
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brooke?

1006
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is to celebrate you.

1007
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Celebrate?

1008
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a total loser you are.

1009
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we ditch losers.

1010
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor Mindy. What did you think?

1011
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cool kids saw something special in you

1012
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and invited you to your first party

1013
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where you'd sip your first beer

1014
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and finally suck face for the first time?

1015
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:41,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Newsflash, you're not special.

1016
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:47,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck with the queen bee and you're gonna get stung.

1017
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Date ditch.

1018
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:52,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Party at my house!

1019
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pathetic.

1020
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Simon, you can drive us.

1021
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave?

1022
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God! Mindy?

1023
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:49,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit. What are you doing?

1024
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:54,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just needed to see my Robin, I guess.

1025
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1026
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to do.

1027
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those girls, they're...

1028
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're evil.

1029
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just high school. Who gives a shit?

1030
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:18,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be out there in the real world

1031
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:19,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}making it a better place.

1032
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, I can't.

1033
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, you promised your dad.

1034
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's not here anymore.

1035
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your life. You've gotta live it.

1036
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I supposed to face them tomorrow?

1037
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:38,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so embarrassed.

1038
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1039
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're smart.

1040
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're beautiful.

1041
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:44,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're funny.

1042
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the strongest person I've ever met.

1043
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:50,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can do anything.

1044
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're Hit Girl.

1045
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't matter if you're wearing a mask or makeup,

1046
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's who you really are.

1047
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what should I do? Cut their tongues out?

1048
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Definitely not.

1049
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fucking with you.

1050
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just beat them at their own game.

1051
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By being yourself.

1052
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if you really wanna be popular,

1053
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}consider two little words,

1054
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"sexy" "tape."

1055
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lois, you don't need these ax wounds.

1056
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I can dress like them, so can you.

1057
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a gift from some drug dealer who went missing.

1058
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because you dress like us,

1059
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't mean you can be like one of us.

1060
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter what costume I wear, yours or mine,

1061
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:07,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a superhero. That's who I am.

1062
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Captain Muffin-Muncher,

1063
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have fun playing make-believe.

1064
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:11,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This?

1065
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:13,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all make-believe, Brooke.

1066
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The reality is you're an evil bitch

1067
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who's just as bad as the worst criminal scum.

1068
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna get real, Mindy?

1069
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:22,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the real world, I win.

1070
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I go to an awesome college, I marry a hot guy

1071
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I make adorable babies for my nanny to take care of

1072
00:55:29,573 --> 00:55:30,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while we vacay in Paris.

1073
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:34,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My life is gonna rock and yours is gonna suck.

1074
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no matter how slutty you dress,

1075
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no boy is ever gonna wanna kiss that hole you call a mouth.

1076
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:42,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why don't you spare us all the whining

1077
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and slit your wrists now?

1078
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause the only thing that's gonna ruin my day

1079
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is looking at your face one more second.

1080
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Told her. Damn.

1081
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that? A ghetto cell phone?

1082
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gonna call for help with a come-back?

1083
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, my daddy bought this from a disgruntled DARPA employee.

1084
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, it was designed for crowd control,

1085
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but deemed too severe.

1086
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:10,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It emits a pulse that creates spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

1087
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called it "the sick stick."

1088
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either your daddy got ripped off,

1089
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or you're back in make-believe land, sweetheart,

1090
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because we feel fabulous.

1091
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not for long.

1092
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God!

1093
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get away from me. Please, you win.

1094
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:36,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna win.

1095
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:38,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to make the world a better place.

1096
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

1097
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You home? Dad?

1098
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this what you've been up to

1099
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while I'm out working nights saving for your college?

1100
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been dressing up and fighting people?

1101
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:11,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is blood on these stick things.

1102
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing in my room?

1103
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was looking for drugs.

1104
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was worried about you.

1105
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, good. Now you can stop.

1106
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Now I'm even more worried.

1107
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, Dave, drugs would have been better.

1108
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is deranged.

1109
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some people do a lot worse.

1110
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, the people you hang outwith? - No.

1111
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people I hang out with are superheroes.

1112
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no such thing, Dave.

1113
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the real world with real consequences.

1114
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When are you gonna grow up?

1115
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it means turning into you, never.

1116
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wear the mask because I'm ashamed of who I am.

1117
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not like you.

1118
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:44,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that supposed to mean?

1119
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're not at work, you're here doing crunches.

1120
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? So you can look like someone else?

1121
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe get a few more years of doing nothing?

1122
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your life has no meaning, Dad.

1123
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you're gone, who's gonna notice?

1124
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the hell are you going?

1125
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, uh, I'm leaving. That's what you do when you grow up.

1126
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he say why he wanted to see me?

1127
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When your Uncle Ralph calls, I don't ask questions.

1128
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the kid.

1129
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, just be cool and you'll be fine.

1130
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how you doing?

1131
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, Uncle Ralph.

1132
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Chrissy,

1133
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}things have been tough all around since your dad,

1134
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know.

1135
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:39,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I been trying to get the family back on track from in here.

1136
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They record these things.

1137
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, it's fine.

1138
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warden's a pal. Now listen to me.

1139
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:46,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay to have a bit of fun,

1140
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you can't go hiring a gang of heavy hitters.

1141
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Javier should have told you.

1142
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it doesn't matter.

1143
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:53,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uncle Ralph,

1144
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:56,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am gonna make Kick-Ass pay for what he did to us.

1145
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chrissy, you need to forget that punk.

1146
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's more important that you stay out of this.

1147
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not like me, or your dad, you're, uh...

1148
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Special.

1149
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't tell me what to do anymore.

1150
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who I am now.

1151
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah?

1152
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who's that?

1153
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:22,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Motherfucker.

1154
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you're the big bad guy, huh?

1155
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:35,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you what real evil looks like.

1156
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1157
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Javier, what's going on?

1158
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, what's up?

1159
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing on Lou's phone, huh?

1160
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop yours in the toilet again?

1161
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything okay?

1162
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for that I needed it.

1163
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For what comes next.

1164
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be stupid, Chris.

1165
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get out of town for a while.

1166
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:30,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to college or something.

1167
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:33,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? You just taught me everything I needed to know.

1168
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Voila!

1169
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Presto and elegant, damn.

1170
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:48,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Them boys designed a very tasty logo.

1171
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter, girl? You hear something?

1172
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's go see. Come on!

1173
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody out here?

1174
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see anything.

1175
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gonna have to stay in there

1176
01:01:13,142 --> 01:01:14,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until you calm down, you lunatic.

1177
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder what's bothering you.

1178
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Tonight you die.

1179
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies first.

1180
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will not shoot me.

1181
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are superhero.

1182
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:34,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You help people. You do not hurt them.

1183
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's supervillain territory.

1184
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or as I like to call my little gang,

1185
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Toxic Mega-Cums.

1186
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like your head.

1187
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:04,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh, it's gotta hurt!

1188
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:20,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did my homework on you, Colonel.

1189
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You used to be Sal Bertolini, didn't you?

1190
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:27,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did a few jobs for my dad back in the day, before you got "born again."

1191
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to hang with a lot of losers.

1192
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:35,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?

1193
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:36,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dressed like an idiot?

1194
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:40,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you supposed to be?

1195
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm The Motherfucker!

1196
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm here to end Kick-Ass. Not just kill him.

1197
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:49,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am gonna shit on everything that he loves.

1198
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's trash this place, guys.

1199
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Miranda Swedlow"?

1200
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:03,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that, Sal?

1201
01:03:03,694 --> 01:03:05,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She one of the whores on your team?

1202
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:23,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night Bitch all snuggled up to Kick-Ass.

1203
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like our boy's got a new hot pocket.

1204
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want me to kill his dog?

1205
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dog? Jesus Christ, I'm not that evil.

1206
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut the old man's head off.

1207
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys hungry? I'm starving. Come on.

1208
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pizza, can we get pizza?

1209
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:42,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting pizza.

1210
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, I kill you first.

1211
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Justice For ever.

1212
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Brooklyn resident was found decapitated last night.

1213
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to Twitter,

1214
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a man claiming to be the world's first supervillain...

1215
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold you, no TV. You're grounded, remember?

1216
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus, I know I made you a promise,

1217
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:06,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I can't keep being someone I'm not.

1218
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I see evil, I have to stop it.

1219
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy, what you did to those girls at school

1220
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:12,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was unacceptable.

1221
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could have really hurt them.

1222
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:14,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right, I could have,

1223
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but instead I sent them home with tummy-aches.

1224
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boo-fucking-hoo.

1225
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:18,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it.

1226
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:21,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This obsession that you have with revenge is not healthy.

1227
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't let me and the police do our jobs,

1228
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is gonna be nothing that I can do for you.

1229
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're never gonna have a normal life

1230
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'll probably end up like your father.

1231
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus, they cut a guy's head off.

1232
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who else is going to stop them?

1233
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass? You?

1234
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go to your room and do your homework.

1235
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

1236
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys, we're signing a sympathy card for the Colonel's sister.

1237
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna go 5 bucks each

1238
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we can send flowers from the team?

1239
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you guys see The Motherfuckers Twitter page?

1240
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this guy? And what's his problem with us?

1241
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, but he has got some elephant-sized balls.

1242
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:09,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been bragging on the web

1243
01:05:09,691 --> 01:05:11,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about what they did to the Colonel.

1244
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can that be traced?

1245
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried. His IP address is masked.

1246
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, here's what we're gonna do.

1247
01:05:17,078 --> 01:05:18,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna organize a fight.

1248
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are a lot of guys online who said they're in if we need them.

1249
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me? This isn't West Side Story.

1250
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:24,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't join up to be in a gang.

1251
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did this so we could help people.

1252
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shannon! right. We need to leave this to the cops.

1253
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We better start walking in pairs.

1254
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motherfuckers tweeted that the Colonel was just the beginning.

1255
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:35,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody seen Night Bitch?

1256
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure she's on that team?

1257
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stupid gash posted on her superhero page

1258
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:53,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that shes dating Kick-Ass.

1259
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

1260
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:00,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Night Bitch!

1261
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, she wants to take the party upstairs.

1262
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna have a party.

1263
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She closed the door.

1264
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, darling, I'm not gonna kill you.

1265
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to give a message to your boyfriend.

1266
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, wriggly.

1267
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go!

1268
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're done banging superheroes, baby.

1269
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's time to see what evil dick feels like.

1270
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:39,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1271
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

1272
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1273
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1274
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:54,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, okay, I'm just... I'm not in the mood.

1275
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:56,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess evil dick feels limp.

1276
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurt her. Bad!

1277
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cops are coming.

1278
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave it to Mother Russia.

1279
01:07:05,085 --> 01:07:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She makes 10 times what we do.

1280
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifty thousand a week. Plus expenses.

1281
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:13,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, watch out!

1282
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reverse it! Reverse it!

1283
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't move! Freeze!

1284
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifty thousand. She's worth it'

1285
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:05,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa! Why are they backing up?

1286
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is there a lawnmower on the trunk?

1287
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need back-up, eight men down.

1288
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you mean 10.

1289
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's bounce! Put the word out I'm building an evil army.

1290
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All psychopaths and ex-cons welcome.

1291
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you're gonna have a problem

1292
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:43,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when people hear about this.

1293
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just disappeared?

1294
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All they have to do is take off their masks,

1295
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no one's gonna recognize them

1296
01:08:53,066 --> 01:08:54,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once they're back in their street clothes.

1297
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your attention, please!

1298
01:08:56,566 --> 01:09:00,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feds traced the IP addresses for all those other costumed freaks.

1299
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:02,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got every law enforcement agency

1300
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the state working to hit them at once!

1301
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is Kick-Ass on this list?

1302
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:07,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His crew does community service.

1303
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't give a shit.

1304
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:11,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone wearing a mask is getting detained.

1305
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:13,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're putting an end to this tonight!

1306
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of people said the cops were too heavy-handed that night.

1307
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you gotta put it into context.

1308
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police didn't mind our real life superhero stuff

1309
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:25,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as long as we were picking up litter

1310
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or helping old ladies cross the street.

1311
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But suddenly it was serious.

1312
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:36,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suddenly we represented everything that was wrong with society.

1313
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:38,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze!

1314
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad had warned me that the real world had real consequences.

1315
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:43,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As they pulled up,

1316
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:45,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he must have been feeling pretty damn vindicated.

1317
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:51,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit, Dave. What have you done?

1318
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police, open up.

1319
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, uh, it's me, Kick-Ass.

1320
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're actually pretty cute under that mask.

1321
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry about what happened.

1322
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be.

1323
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my own fault.

1324
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:25,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna find these assholes and make this right.

1325
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the point?

1326
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, we're really superheroes

1327
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about as much as we're really dating.

1328
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't even know each others names.

1329
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time to get back to the real world.

1330
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we were trying to make it a better place.

1331
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why is it worse?

1332
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Night Bitch was right,

1333
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which means Dad was, too.

1334
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, things had gotten out of hand.

1335
01:10:57,854 --> 01:11:00,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it was time for me to stop crashing at Marty's

1336
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and start apologizing.

1337
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

1338
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my dad.

1339
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:17,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad's Kick-Ass? What?

1340
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he just gave himself up.

1341
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't understand. He's doing this to protect me.

1342
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:24,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad!

1343
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:26,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad!

1344
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mindy?   - Dave?

1345
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:47,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need your help. My dad's been arrested.

1346
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They think he's Kick-Ass. Can you talk to Marcus?

1347
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm grounded. - So?

1348
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that means I can't get involved.

1349
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Wait a second. I wish I could help.

1350
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy! Are you on the phone?

1351
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I gotta go, okay?

1352
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Dave.

1353
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy, wait, wait.

1354
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what the hell were you thinking?

1355
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I could ask you the same thing.

1356
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe you lied to them.

1357
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:21,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't gonna do nothing while you went to jail.

1358
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:25,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I chose this. You should let me deal with the consequences.

1359
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you wanted me to grow up.

1360
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? When you get a kid of your own one day,

1361
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:29,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll understand.

1362
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:30,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1363
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It'll just make things worse.

1364
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I spoke to my attorney.

1365
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said they gotta let me out by tomorrow.

1366
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No actual crime was committed.

1367
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are people out there who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

1368
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:48,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the cops are out there looking for them,

1369
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so the safest place for Kick-Ass is right here,

1370
01:12:50,392 --> 01:12:52,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}locked away.

1371
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how you got into all this shit, but...

1372
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you gotta promise me

1373
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you will never dress up in that outfit again.

1374
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:00,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you hear me?

1375
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

1376
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This evil lair owns!

1377
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do people still say that, "own"?

1378
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, of course.

1379
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your shark. Somethings wrong.

1380
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think you used the wrong kind of water.

1381
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell, Eyal?

1382
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fine, Chris.

1383
01:13:31,217 --> 01:13:32,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're supposed to lie at the bottom of the tank.

1384
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:36,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just their way of, how you say, settling into their environment.

1385
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't screw me on this, okay?

1386
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said we'd be ready in two days,

1387
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:40,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we don't even have a men's room yet.

1388
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:41,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

1389
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's with the bags of shit?

1390
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fertilizer for the bombs.

1391
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a supervillain

1392
01:13:47,146 --> 01:13:49,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you don't have a plan to destroy the city.

1393
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will not work. You need a chemical kind.

1394
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:54,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I have to do everything myself?

1395
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:55,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just fix it!

1396
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must relax.

1397
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything is going as planned.

1398
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm, no. No. Except it's not, okay?

1399
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sad sack is not Kick-Ass.

1400
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen Kick-Ass, he's like my age.

1401
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy's old enough to be his father.

1402
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No shit, right.

1403
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, who are you?

1404
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, uh, volunteered for your evil army, like the others.

1405
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. I appreciate that.

1406
01:14:18,915 --> 01:14:20,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for joining the cause.

1407
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:24,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the VIP area for the core group.

1408
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought it was funny you said that.

1409
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he is Kick-Ass, father.

1410
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:29,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

1411
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lizewski. He's Kick-Ass, dad.

1412
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up!

1413
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

1414
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1415
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you, my friend, have just earned

1416
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}life-time access to my VIP area.

1417
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go take a little seat.

1418
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, get the kid a Frappuccino,

1419
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then put his little punk ass back to work.

1420
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1421
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1422
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I help you?

1423
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:16,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Motherfucker wants us to take a picture with you.

1424
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It helps that my dad is a really good lawyer.

1425
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I don't think my beautiful ass

1426
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:23,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would last too long in prison.

1427
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, that's weird.

1428
01:15:25,243 --> 01:15:27,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris D'Amico just texted me a picture.

1429
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:30,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red Mist? Whatever happened to that guy?

1430
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

1431
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, what's wrong?

1432
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

1433
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next few days passed in a fog.

1434
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:08,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't matter that I told the police about Chris,

1435
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they couldn't find him.

1436
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cops did show up at Dad's funeral,

1437
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not out of respect,

1438
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but because they were scared something would happen.

1439
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad was a decent man.

1440
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All he ever did was try and give me a good life,

1441
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I told him no one would notice when he was gone.

1442
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, pal.

1443
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, too, Dad.

1444
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:42,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys came.

1445
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:46,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd love to help you track down this Chris D'Amico d-bag,

1446
01:16:46,555 --> 01:16:46,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but...

1447
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:49,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we just got out on parole.

1448
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:50,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's fine.

1449
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not looking for revenge.

1450
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last thing I promised my dad

1451
01:16:55,128 --> 01:16:56,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was that I was gonna give this up.

1452
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1453
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you started this.

1454
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I'm ending it.

1455
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:14,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, I'm so sorry.

1456
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you hate me for not helping?

1457
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not even a little bit.

1458
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right. You gave it up.

1459
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:27,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I had, too, my dad would still be alive.

1460
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only person I blame is myself.

1461
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:47,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do this!

1462
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:51,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down!

1463
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:57,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy!

1464
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:01,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spread out!

1465
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your head down!

1466
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1467
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him!

1468
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get that van over here!

1469
01:18:35,311 --> 01:18:36,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up!

1470
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy?

1471
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy!

1472
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy?

1473
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta put this on.

1474
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna do it.

1475
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:11,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing left you can do to hurt me.

1476
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna bet?

1477
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game on, cocksuckers!

1478
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a girl on the roof!

1479
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's still up there!

1480
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think I got her! - Go check!

1481
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:13,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out there!

1482
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Move your head.

1483
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull over, pube-face.

1484
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know Chris D'Amico is The Motherfucker.

1485
01:21:07,848 --> 01:21:08,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he hiding?

1486
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat a dick.

1487
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna eat yours if you don't start talking.

1488
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead and shoot me, you little bitch.

1489
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing you can do that would make me talk.

1490
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:17,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, hold on.

1491
01:21:17,766 --> 01:21:19,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't do this right now.

1492
01:21:19,433 --> 01:21:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my dad's funeral.

1493
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, your father loved you.

1494
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:28,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like my daddy loved me.

1495
01:21:28,215 --> 01:21:30,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know it hurts, but maybe,

1496
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe that's the real meaning of being a superhero.

1497
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:38,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is taking that pain and turning it into something good.

1498
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:40,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something right.

1499
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:43,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember what you told me?

1500
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:47,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your life. You've gotta live it.

1501
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now help me find some pliers.

1502
01:21:51,113 --> 01:21:53,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1503
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously?

1504
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - Marcus?

1505
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy. What's going on? Are you okay?

1506
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:02,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine.

1507
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know where The Motherfucker's hiding.

1508
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's recruiting an army of supervillains

1509
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:07,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and making homemade bombs.

1510
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus, he wants to burn the city down.

1511
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised me.

1512
01:22:11,193 --> 01:22:12,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Know you see me as this little girl,

1513
01:22:14,197 --> 01:22:16,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm not and I never was.

1514
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

1515
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy did take my childhood away,

1516
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm not so sure that was a bad thing.

1517
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus, he gave me a gift,

1518
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:26,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a gift that I can't escape no matter how hard I try.

1519
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:29,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't need to spend the next four years of my life

1520
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to figure out who I am

1521
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I already know.

1522
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Hit Girl.

1523
01:22:39,306 --> 01:22:43,184


1524
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:45,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I posted the address. Do you think they'll show?

1525
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris has an army.

1526
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:49,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These real life super dweebs

1527
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have been waiting their whole lives for a call like this.

1528
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:04,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1529
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Yeah, no... I'm fine.

1530

01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what it means to be evil.

1559
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:44,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We, my friends, are the real 1%,

01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:56,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter, Chris?

1574
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit hit your shorts?

1579
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready to die, little girl?

1580
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,517

1594
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:08,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is the point of wearing a mask

1595
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you can't do what you want?

1596
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want to do good.

1597
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, people want to win the lottery.

1598
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:24,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People want to fuck Scarlett Johansson.

1599
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:38,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you can kill me with little needle?

1600
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not what it's for.

1601
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called adrenaline, bitch.

1602
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:08,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that, some cheap shot?

1603
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was for the Colonel.

1604
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's for Night Bitch.

1605
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's for my dad.

1606
01:31:58,428 --> 01:32:02,425


1607
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:05,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing?

1608
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:07,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Saving your whiny ass!

1610
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't let you have this. I'd rather die!

1611
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is wrong with you, dude?

1612
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:16,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not a comic book, it's real life!

1613
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:19,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you're dead, it's done.

1614
01:32:19,028 --> 01:32:20,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no sequel.

1615
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made this real.

1616
01:32:22,082 --> 01:32:22,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You started it!

1617
01:32:23,294 --> 01:32:25,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna finish it.

1618
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be immortal' like an evil Jesus.

1619
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:40,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait!

1620
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm alive.

1621
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, I'm so sorry.

1622
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:08,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The feeling was indescribable.

1623
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:10,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris D'Amico, dead.

1624
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:15,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His wannabe supervillains, defeated.

1625
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:19,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But did we make the world a better place?

1626
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or did we just finish something that began

1627
01:33:23,448 --> 01:33:25,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I first put on this mask?

1628
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:30,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cops are coming.

1629
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll take care of the bad guys.

1630
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We better skedaddle before they get here.

1631
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:36,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did it.

1632
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:38,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck, yeah.

1633
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, language.

1634
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:40,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right,

1635
01:33:41,251 --> 01:33:42,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we're gonna dress like heroes,

1636
01:33:43,303 --> 01:33:44,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we should act like heroes.

1637
01:33:45,887 --> 01:33:48,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd be proud of you, Dave.

1638
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd be proud of all of us.

1639
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:55,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know we can never do this again, right?

1640
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's over.

1641
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:04,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One last time. Come on.

1642
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say, Hit Girl? Are you in?

1643
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:15,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why the hell not?

1644
01:34:17,085 --> 01:34:19,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Justice Forever!

1645
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:33,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for the ride.

1646
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:36,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you at school.

1647
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:40,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm leaving New York, Dave.

1648
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:41,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't go home.

1649
01:34:41,831 --> 01:34:44,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't put Marcus in that position.

1650
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:46,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? He won't arrest you.

1651
01:34:46,007 --> 01:34:47,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just saved the city.

1652
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:50,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, I also killed six guys with a cop's gun.

1653
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:53,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vigilantes don't get a free pass.

1654
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:57,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go. People need you.

1655
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They've got you now. - Mindy...

1656
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not like you.

1657
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:08,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to be a bad-ass to be a superhero, Dave.

1658
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just have to be brave.

1659
01:35:24,252 --> 01:35:25,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

1660
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was my first kiss.

1661
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be nice or I'll rip your ass  out through your mouth.

1662
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When Mindy left,

1663
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:48,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's when I finally understood where my life was going.

1664
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:51,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like it had to eventually happen,

1665
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:54,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that real people would try to be superheroes.

1666
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:58,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eventually it had to end, too.

1667
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:18,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Superheroes can't exist in the real world for a reason.

1668
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:22,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's because the real world needs real heroes.

1669
01:36:23,478 --> 01:36:26,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And not some punk in a wet-suit playing dress-up,

1670
01:36:27,315 --> 01:36:31,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but a genuine bad-ass who can really kick ass.

1671
01:36:34,764 --> 01:36:50,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}亲，有空的时候可以来交流电影哦 加我QQ：1610169789

1674
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go.

1675
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:28,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is anybody there?

1676
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:32,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1677
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some help, please?

1678
01:42:39,754 --> 01:42:41,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A shark bit my fucking dick off

1679
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:43,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I can't get some water?
