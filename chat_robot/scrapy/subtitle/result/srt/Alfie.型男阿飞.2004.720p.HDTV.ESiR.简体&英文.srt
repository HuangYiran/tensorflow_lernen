3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,218
知道吗 你很幸运
You're lucky, you know.

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,537
我很少让人进我的房间
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.

5
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,136
我知道 我知道 我知道
I know, I know, I know.

6
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,531
简居陋室
Humble digs.

7
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,971
我不是你想的那种"内裤猎人"
Not exactly what you'd call a "panty peeler."

8
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,892
懂我的意思吗
Do you know what I mean?

9
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,414
但它正适合我
But it suits me just fine.

10
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,409
老实说 我很少在自己的床上过夜
To be honest, I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway.

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,579
瞧 这就是我的见解:
You see, here's my theory:

12
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,492
对多数女人来说 如果一个男人乐意付出
For most women, if a guy's a good provider

13
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,138
而且人也不错 那么没有六块腹肌也没什么
and generally a nice chap, six-pack abs really aren't a deal-breaker.

14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,773
不过 也不绝对
On the flip side, however,

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,250
即使网络男朋友坐在你旁边
even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you

16
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,048
手搭在你的肩膀上 你也不会心动
with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it...

17
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,170
其实他也不会心动 对男人而言 我们只关心F.B.B 那就是:
And he will deny it. For us boys, it's all about F.B.B.

18
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,215
脸蛋 胸脯 屁股
Face. Boobs. Bum.

19
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,012
我只是实话实说
I'm just being honest.

20
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,252
人家说衣服是国际通用语言
It's been said that clothes speak the international language.

21
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,851
我必须承认一点 我对时尚很追崇
And I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fashion whore.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,419
不幸的是 我今天要去上班 所以我必须穿的低调一点
Unfortunately, today I've got work, and I have to tone it down a little bit,

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,412
但是 没问题 Gucci 去年的夏季大甩卖！
but that's all right. Gucci. End-of-summer sale.

24
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,137
很朴素 而且我能轻而易举得搭配
Very understated. And I can easily spice it up with...

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,333
什么 不 不 我知道你在想什么
What? No, no. I know what you are thinking.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,010
如果你有阳刚气 就像我们这里的某人一样
If you ooze masculinity, like some of us do,

27
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,457
你没理由避开粉红色 帅呆了！
you have no reason to fear pink. Smashing.

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,970
现在 该撒古龙水了 很多男人用过头了
Now, in the cologne department, most men overdo it.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,093
美国人通常是喷洒
Americans practically spray it on with a crop-duster.

30
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,537
我的原则：颈部以上不用
My rule: Nothing above the neck,

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,010
但是我却喜欢在我的大笨钟上面撒一点
though I do like a little splash on Big Ben.

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,770
你永远不会知道今天会发生什么
You never know where the day may take you.

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,617
差点忘了
Almost forgot.

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,019
每日一词
New word for the day.

35
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,655
"卖弄: 试图吸引别人注意力的行为"
"Ostentatious: The attempt to attract attention to oneself."

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,175
谁 我
Who? Me?

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,692
哦 我太失礼了 我还没介绍我自己
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude. I haven't introduced myself.

38
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,255
－我是...  －阿尔菲
－I'm... －Alfie

39
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,530
你知道了 阿尔菲
There you go. Alfie.

40
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,410
是你这个小精灵在我门前留的莫卡咖啡塘吗
Are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?

41
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,609
没有 一定是有人暗恋你 斯尼特莫太太
No, no, no. You must have a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,608
你真可爱 阿尔菲 但是我应该节食
You are such a doll, Alfie. But I'm supposed to be on a diet.

43
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,615
哦 节食?
Oh, on a diet?

44
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,175
－节食? －您?
－A diet. －You?

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,695
－是的 －我不想说得太直接 露
－Yeah. －Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu,

46
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,495
但您必须知道 像您这样丰满的女孩
but you should know by now that a full-figured girl like yourself

47
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,379
－是每个男人的梦想 - 别再说了
－is every guy's secret fantasy. －Stop it.

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,929
虽然她像一摊猪油 事已至此
So she's a tub of lard. The ship's already sailed,

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,695
那何不让她自我感觉良好一点呢 是吧
so why not make her feel good about herself, right?

50
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,538
－哦 对了 露 －是的 亲爱的
－Oh, Lu －Yes, angel

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,699
我今天上夜班
I'm working the night spot,

52
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,134
而我的房间里一团糟 不过我很不好意思总是让你
and my apartment is a horror show, so I'm sorry if I keep you up

53
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,094
－在下午两点帮我打扫一下 －哦 别担心
－with the dust－busting at 2 a.m. －Oh, don't you worry.

54
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,497
－我会很快帮你整理一下的 －不 不 您不必那样
－I'll give it a quick straighten. －Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.

55
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,295
别这么说 我乐意服侍你 阿尔菲
Nonsense. I like doing things for you, Alfie.

56
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,293
有你在我身边 我真是太幸福了
I'm a blessed man having you in my life.

57
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,249
谢谢你
Thank you.

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,736
钥匙在老地方
Keys are in the usual spot.

59
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,253
在家里你总是能听到一些人的传奇故事:
Now, back home, you're always hearing tales about some bloke

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,619
移民到美国 然后大把大把地捞钞票
migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money.

61
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,738
所以不久前  我打点行囊 来到这里
So not long ago, I packed up my bucket and headed west.

62
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,893
我得承认 我有其他动机
Now, I must admit, I had a second motive.

63
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,496
人们都说世界上 最漂亮的女孩都
I'd always been told that the most beautiful women in the world...

64
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,972
...聚集在曼哈顿
...resided in Manhattan.

65
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,497
当你决定去搞女人时 只会关心一件事:
And when it comes to shagging birds, it's all about one thing:

66
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,850
地点 地点 地点
Location, location, location.

67
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,613
上帝 我爱死这座城市了 好啊 女孩们
God, I love this city. All right, girls.

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,339
看看周围 每个都那么独一无二 与众不同
Just look around. I mean, every one of them, unique, special,

69
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,417
就像雪花瓣
like snowflakes.

70
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,539
又是那么的丰盛...
And with such a plethora...

71
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,179
每日一词上的解释是"魅力十足 差异万千"
Calendar word meaning "abundance," of gorgeousness and diversity,

72
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,339
这样的话 一个男人怎么能 只想和一个女人厮守到老呢
well, how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?

73
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,977
我本人更信奉欧式生活哲理:
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life.

74
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,451
酒和女人永远是第一位的...
My priorities leaning towards wine, women...

75
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,616
事实上 人生就如此
Well, actually, that's about it.

76
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,811
酒和女人
Wine and women.

77
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,972
然而 在女人之间做选择 亦是一件乐事
Although, women and women is always a fun option.

78
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,453
所以
So...

79
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,454
...尽情地享受生活
...to live life to the fullest,

80
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,849
我只需应付日常的开销就足够
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses.

81
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,376
我不想成为墓地里最有钱的死尸
I've no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,136
我想这也许是我最喜爱的体位了
I think this might just be my favourite position.

83
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,168
我知道这是肯尼迪总统的招牌姿势
I know it was President Kennedy's.

84
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,130
他真是个潮流领导者
He was such a great leader.

85
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,735
当然 他只是用背伤作为藉口
Of course, JFK used the old bad-back excuse,

86
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,818
但我觉得 其实他知道 这个体位会给人最大的快感
but if you ask me, he knew it gave you maximum pleasure

87
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,619
用最小的付出
with minimum exertion.

88
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,299
加长轿车的后背座怎么样
What is it about the back of a limo?

89
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,976
不可推托的拥抱
Obligatory cuddling.

90
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,057
一千零一
Thousand one,

91
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,579
一千零二...
thousand two...

92
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,858
哦 嘿 我得走了 我十点要去接人
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking. I've got a 10:00 pickup.

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,408
你最好快点 你不会想让她久等的
You better hurry up. You don't want to keep her waiting.

94
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,928
还算不错吧
Quite the number, isn't she?

95
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,496
但是  她告诉我她老公 六个月没碰她了
Yet, she tells me her old man hasn't shagged her in six months.

96
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,218
六个月！我的意思是 感谢上帝 幸好还有像我这样的"绅士"在
Six months. I mean, thank God there are gentlemen like me around

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,376
来填补这个空挡
to pick up the slack.

98
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,335
看看她 像赛马般的腿
Just look at her. Legs like a racehorse.

99
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,494
完美的瑜伽身心 我给她打出了我的最高分:
Perfect yoga bum. I give her my highest grade:

100
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,698
A-
A-minus.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,456
你怎么跟你老公说我们今晚去了哪
Where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?

102
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,573
－看电影 －宝贝  求你 别别这样
－A movie. －Treasure, please, no, no, no.

103
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,578
你把我的预设都打乱了
Stop messing about. You'll ruin my presets.

104
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,049
－抱歉 －看什么电影
－Sorry. －What movie?

105
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,494
我不知道 有什么区别吗
I don't know. What's the difference?

106
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,739
区别在于  你告诉他越详细 他就越不感兴趣
The difference is, the more detail you give, the less interested he'll be.

107
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,458
我说什么都无所谓
It wouldn't matter what I said.

108
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,892
菲儿决不会想到会有其他男人
It would never occur to Phil that another man

109
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,812
－会再看上我 －桃儿 亲爱的
－would ever look twice at me. －Dor, darling,

110
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,049
你想寻求恭维
you fishing for a compliment?

111
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,535
不是
No.

112
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,217
到现在 你应该知道 只有在最不经意间 我才会这样
You should know by now they only come from me when least expected.

113
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,576
吃块薄荷糖 这样菲尔就闻不到你的呼吸中有我的味道了
Now, come and have a mint so Phil doesn't smell the Alfie on your breath.

114
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,494
他闻到了我也不在乎
I don't care if he does.

115
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,933
只有一件事让我远离婚姻: 那就是已婚女人
There's one thing that puts me off marriage: It's married women.

116
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,696
桃利还不明白这个
Dorie doesn't know it yet,

117
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,415
但你不太会想再看到她了
but you won't be seeing much more of her.

118
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,974
我有点腻了的感觉
I've got that all-too-familiar feeling.

119
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,652
迟早 她会提出我满足不了的要求
Sooner or later, she'll be wanting a little bit more than I'm able to give.

120
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,330
今晚如果我跟你回家 而不是菲尔那个傻瓜
Wouldn't it be great if I was going home with you tonight

121
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,968
那不是很好吗
instead of Phil the Pill?

122
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,938
是啊
Yeah.

123
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,170
绝对是到玩消失的时间了
It's definitely time to stage a disappearing act.

124
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,850
那么下周二  老时间 老地方吗
So next Tuesday, same time, same place?

125
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,696
抱歉  亲爱的 那是时装周 我要轮班
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week. I'm booked double shifts.

126
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,333
－我忙完就打电话给你 －好
－I'll call you the instant things let up. －Okay.

127
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,774
另外 我还留了一些小纪念品让你会想起我
In the meantime, I left you a little souvenir to remember me by.

128
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,818
哦 桃
Oh, Dor

129
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,658
你的臀部从这个角度看实在是很迷人
Your derriere looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point.

130
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,659
瞧
See?

131
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,331
出其不意的恭维
A compliment when least expected.

132
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,809
我说什么好呢 快乐得像个摇尾巴的小狗
What can I say? Happy as a pup with two tails.

133
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,771
而且我觉得也算帮了老菲儿一个小忙
And I think I've done old Phil a bit of a favour too.

134
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,811
当然 他肯定是最后一个知情的
Of course, he'd be the last to see it.

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,931
别指望此生能够得到任何人的报答
Never expect any thanks in this life.

136
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,053
你明白吗 那么下周二...
You know what I mean? So Tuesday...

137
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,731
...晚上10:03
...10:03 p.m.

138
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,896
我是该回我那冷冰冰的房间 空空如也的冰箱
Do I drag myself home to a cold flat, empty fridge,

139
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,858
还是快点回城里 享受热水澡 混暖的身体 在床上享用早餐呢
or nip across town for a hot bath, warm body, breakfast in bed?

140
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,773
做决定 做决定...
Decisions, decisions...

141
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,970
没错 我想该去看看我的半正式的
Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit to my semi-regular,

142
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,492
准女朋友
quasi, sort of girlfriend.

143
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,696
我的宝贝茱莉.
My sweet Julie.

144
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,410
让我猜猜 出乎意料的最后一刻她来找你
Let me guess. Unexpected last-minute fare.

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,652
是啊 她让我来来回回的开了几个小时
Yeah. She had me going up and down for hours.

146
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,410
那不是很有趣吗 因为那是如此...
That supposed to be funny? Because it is so very...

147
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,338
没趣
Not.

148
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,659
嗨!
Hey!

149
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,775
我不是开玩笑 阿尔菲!
I'm not kidding, Alfie!

150
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,899
我没开玩笑 有时侯我真的恨你
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.

151
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,652
是啊 你懂得如何用炫耀的方式来表现出来
You have a very ostentatious way of showing it.

152
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,492
是 我当然会
Yeah, I sure do.

153
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,529
不 亲爱的 我们能停一下吗 我只想放松一下
No, darling. Can we hit pause? I just need a second to unwind.

154
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,253
哦,我从豪华轿车里偷了半瓶伏特加酒
Oh, I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo.

155
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,653
你想怎么喝 加冰块吗
How do you want yours, on the rocks?

156
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,208
我就想像往常一样 阿尔菲 来吧
I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.

157
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,737
不 我已经精疲力尽了 我明天早上再补偿你
No, I'm so totally knackered. I'll make it up to you in the morning.

158
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,050
我保证
Cross my heart.

159
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,297
但是今晚  我只想好好的吃一顿 洗个热水澡
But tonight, all I'm good for is a bite to eat, hot bath

160
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,651
再好好地睡一觉
and a nice long sleep.

161
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,610
这里不是假日酒店 阿尔菲
You know, this isn't a Holiday Inn, Alfie.

162
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,412
你说什么
What's that again?

163
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,688
你今晚到底去哪儿了 说真的
Where were you tonight? Really?

164
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,455
你真该去开个餐馆 这真是太好吃了
You've got to open a restaurant. That's seriously delicious.

165
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,219
谢谢 阿尔菲 这只是辣椒而已
Thanks, Alfie. It's just chilli.

166
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,659
嗨
Hey.

167
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,538
来吧 看着我
A little eye contact, please.

168
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,257
我们之间真有感情
We have something here,

169
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,615
还是我只是你随叫随到的女人呢
or am I just a glorified booty call?

170
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,493
嗨
Hey.

171
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,813
嗨
Hey.

172
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,611
其实她想说的是
Here's what she's really saying:

173
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,613
她想要我负责 意思是: 成为 "正式的"
She wants me to commit. Translation: Become "domestified."

174
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,094
在一生中依属与任何人都是个错误
Now, it doesn't do to become dependent on anybody in this life.

175
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,616
改变你的本性 那你就死定了
Change your nature, you're a dead man.

176
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,337
再来点红辣椒
Chilli, please.

177
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,138
不要误解我 她是很可爱
Don't get me wrong. She's adorable.

178
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,010
乖巧? 当然啦 但那就足够了吗
Cute? Absolutely. But is it ever enough?

179
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,857
我告诉你男人是什么 我们想要惊艳
I told you how we men are. We want showstoppers.

180
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,774
问题在于: 茱利叶还未惊艳到...
And the problem is, Julie hasn't got enough

181
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,654
足以让我当回事
of the superficial things that really matter.

182
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,256
－我不值你对我那么好 －是啊 也许真的是
－I don't deserve you. －Yeah, that's probably true.

183
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,054
我爱死你了
Too bad I love you.

184
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,658
谢谢 亲爱的
Thanks, babe.

185
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,932
－阿尔菲 阿尔菲 －怎么了
－Alfie, Alfie... －What?

186
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,294
你竟然对我说 "谢谢 亲爱的"
You're giving me the "Thanks, babe."

187
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,616
你就用"谢谢 亲爱的"来回答我！
You're giving me the "Thanks, baby."

188
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,050
－冷静点 －别让我冷静!
－Calm down. －Don't tell me to calm down!

189
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,938
－我知道你怎么想! －等等
－I know how you feel! －Wait a minute.

190
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,655
－你会吵醒...  －麦克斯
－You're gonna wake up... －Max.

191
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,255
嗨 小家伙 我们吵醒你了吗
Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?

192
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,018
是啊
Yes.

193
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,170
伙计们 吸取我的教训
Now, lads, learn from my mistake.

194
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,931
决不要跟单身妈妈交往
Never get involved with a single mum.

195
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,775
瞧 她们带着附属品
See, they come with accessories,

196
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,458
有些是...
some of which can be...

197
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,295
...不幸的 无法逃避的
...unfortunately, irresistible.

198
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,975
像刚才那一幕 提醒你我都是有保质期
Sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date.

199
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,494
而女人的确比男人的保质期要短 不是吗
And women do have a shorter shelf life than men, don't they?

200
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,214
我认为这是茱利叶昨天发脾气的原因
I think that's what Julie was banging on about yesterday.

201
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,654
豪华轿车及司机
Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.

202
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,013
我以此为生
This is where I make my reasonably honest living.

203
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,537
这狠狠地打击了优雅的定义 你觉得呢
Standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?

204
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,658
我知道 相信我 这不过是一块踏脚石
I know. Believe me, it's merely a stepping stone.

205
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,417
现在只做着原地准备而已
Currently parked on one of those stepping stones

206
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,252
是我的好朋友 以及未来合伙人 马龙
is my best mate and future business partner, Marlon.

207
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,891
黑色 就像洛内迪的肤色
Black. Like Lonette's skin...

208
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,448
...我再也触碰不到了
...which I will never again touch.

209
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,889
恐怕 你看到的他 心情很不好
I'm afraid you're not meeting my man on top form.

210
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,335
瞧 马龙最近比较烦
See, Marlon's got a problem.

211
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,851
"恼人"的洛内迪
It's called Lonette.

212
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,579
前不久 她甩了他
And very recently, it dumped him.

213
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,572
哦 亲爱的 拜托 这次什么问题呢
Oh, dear. Come on, what was it this time?

214
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,013
凌晨三点 我在她门前乞求她
Three a.m. Begging, at her front door.

215
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,779
－有多醉 －呕吐了
－Level of inebriation? －Vomiting.

216
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,888
好 让我理顺一下 凌晨三点
Right. So let me get this straight. You were at her front door,

217
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,497
你在她家门口 边乞求 边呕吐
3 a.m. In the morning, begging and vomiting?

218
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,209
然后呢 她不为此感动吗
And what, she wasn't charmed by that?

219
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,215
阿尔菲 为什么2号车里的伏特加酒没了
Alfie? Why is there no Stoli in car number two?

220
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,492
我不知道
I've no idea.

221
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,212
我得好好地看着这个家伙了
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.

222
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,939
这矮家伙名叫闻
That little chap's name is Wing.

223
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,091
我老板 这个烂企业的老板
My boss and owner of this tragic enterprise.

224
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,894
－好好擦车 －"老板的概念"只是在我和马龙
－Wipe that car good. －Owner, that is, till me and Marlon

225
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,535
搞到贷款 把这家公司从他手里买下来之前
swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny...

226
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,492
嗨 这里 鸟粪没擦掉
Hello. You miss bird shit.

227
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,012
闻
Wing.

228
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,057
他是个乱叫的疯子
He's barking mad.

229
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,935
看他和那个女人说话的样子
Check out the way he talks to the little woman.

230
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,813
她给了他青春 帮他做饭
She's given him her best years, cooked his chop suey,

231
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,739
帮他打理公司一切事务 我打赌 曾有一次
helped with the business, and I bet at one time he couldn't wait

232
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,129
他迫不及待地撕开她的和服 但看看现在的他
to rip off her kimono. And now look at him.

233
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,768
我开始怀疑起婚姻制度
And I'm supposed to respect the institution of marriage?

234
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,618
真是个好主意 我们搞到那笔贷款
That's a great figure, man. We swing that loan,

235
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,898
你从退休帐户上提钱 我当了摩托车
cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...

236
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,893
那一定会让闻大吃一惊的
We're gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this.

237
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,738
我能预料到这些 瞧 马龙和洛内迪的感情到了
I could've predicted this. See, Marlon and Lonette have reached

238
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,175
这关键的"18个月"的危险时期 "我们的未来怎样 我们在干什么"
that critical 18-month "Where are we going, what are we doing,

239
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,419
"我们怎么了" 这些讨厌的问题
what's happening here?" crisis point that rears its ugly head

240
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,619
会出现在任何一段感情里 洛内迪想要结婚 家庭 孩子
in every relationship. Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.

241
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,619
马龙则还想要18个月
Marlon wanted another 18 months

242
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,850
以确定他不会遇上更好的
to make sure nothing better was coming his way.

243
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,410
我把事情搞砸了
I fucked up egregiously.

244
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,492
我看见你很茫然 不知所措
I see you're making the most of that birthday calendar.

245
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,459
等他意识到错误 希望她回到自己身边时...
By the time he realized he'd made a mistake and he wanted her back...

246
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,939
一切都太晚了 －嗨 陌生人
...it was too late. －Hey, stranger.

247
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,819
嗨
Hey.

248
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,939
...卡洛
Carol.

249
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,898
－卡洛!嗨 卡洛 －嗨
－Carol. Hi, Carol. －Hi.

250
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,611
你看上去棒极了
You look wonderful.

251
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,848
啊 卡洛 真高兴又见到你 你保重
So, Carol, well, it's nice to see you again. You be well.

252
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,729
刚才到底怎么回事
What's up with that?

253
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,376
这么说吧 戏才刚开场就结束了
Put it this way, the show closed after one performance only.

254
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,498
－我能知道为什么吗 －算了吧
－Do I even wanna know why? －No. Come on,

255
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,772
告诉你后就没意思了
it would be less than discreet to tell you why.

256
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,016
手臂上的毛 说真的 又粗又厚...
Hair on the arms. Seriously. Long, thick...

257
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,492
你在说什么 你手上没毛吗
What are you talking about? You don't have hair on your arms?

258
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,332
－你今晚看起来真漂亮 －谢谢
－You're looking very lovely tonight. －Thank you.

259
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,608
哦 吃闭门羹了 老兄
Dude, the iron door has slammed shut, man.

260
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,417
经典 不是吗
Classic, isn't it?

261
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,135
现在他得不到她 他觉得自己不能没有她
Now that he can't have her, he thinks he can't live without her.

262
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,816
有些人真是搞笑
Some people are funny.

263
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,654
马龙的尴尬处境让我想到我自己
Marlon's predicament got me thinking about my own situation.

264
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,819
或许...该是时候回家撩起欲火了
Maybe... Maybe it was time to stoke the home fires.

265
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,412
有人给小阿尔菲开门吗
Anybody in the mood for a little Alfie, straight up?

266
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,933
哦 阿尔菲 现在不是时候 我心里很乱
Oh, this isn't a good time, Alfie. Got a lot on my mind.

267
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,173
哦 上帝 是啊 我真的很讨厌那样
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate when that happens.

268
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,096
开门 宝贝 你看上去美极了
Open up, baby. You look seriously beautiful.

269
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,372
－今晚不行 阿尔菲 －怎么了 告诉我
－Not tonight, Alfred. －What's the matter? Tell me.

270
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,255
我没什么...我只是... 我想我只是看到了
I don't... I'm just... Well, I guess I'm... I'm just...

271
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,049
我简直眼火爆
I'm just seeing red.

272
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,411
我是说 那个可怜人在痛不欲生
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.

273
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,209
算了吧,难道你... 你已经折磨他很长时间了
Come on, haven't you...? You've tortured him long enough.

274
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,938
阿尔菲 他应该早料到这一天的
Alfie, he should've thought about all that

275
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,939
在他和他前女友搞不清楚之前
before he was screwing around with that ex-girlfriend of his.

276
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,295
那些假臀 廉价货色
Those fake-ass, $5 titties.

277
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,369
－那些是假的 －醒醒吧
－Those are fake? －Hello?

278
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,091
哇 我郁闷了 那些就像...
Wow, I'm devastated. They've got, like...

279
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,530
阿尔菲 你来这里该是来安抚我的 记得吗
Alfie, you're supposed to be consoling my devastation, remember?

280
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,210
我是 看他回心转意了 不是吗
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?

281
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,735
双膝跪地 边乞求 边呕吐...
Begging, crawling on his knees, vomiting...

282
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,418
我不在乎
I don't care.

283
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,619
抱歉 我没那么好骗 而且我决不原谅他 也绝不会忘记
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't forgive and I definitely do not forget.

284
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,815
－我现在走行吗 小姐 －噢 是的 菲力克斯
－Is okay if I leave now, miss? －Oh, si, Felix.

285
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,614
顺道把灯关上 谢谢
And hit the lights on your way out, por favor.

286
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,458
我该走了
I better go.

287
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,370
外面要下大雨了
It's really coming down out there.

288
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,371
是啊
Yeah.

289
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,536
而且我穿着绒衣
And I'm wearing suede.

290
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,174
你得说真话 太好玩了
You're telling the truth. That's brilliant.

291
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,935
好吧 我想起来一个 我从没在太平洋里游过泳
Okay. I got one. I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.

292
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,289
－我也没有 －哦 该死
－Me neither. －Oh, shit. Okay.

293
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,492
哦 我从没看过一部007电影
Okay. I've never seen a James Bond movie.

294
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,611
你开玩笑 连肖恩.康纳里演的也没看过吗
You're joking. Not even a Sean Connery?

295
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,888
真的吗
You serious?

296
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,218
哇 不知道这到底算是奇迹还是悲剧
Wow, I don't know if that's magic or tragic.

297
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,498
好 五球 该我了
Okay. Five ball. My go.

298
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,775
－我从没自己铺过床 －哦 胡说
－I've never made my own bed. －Oh, bullshit.

299
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,019
不 我重复一遍 我从没自己铺过床
No, I repeat, I've never made my own bed.

300
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,534
哦 你有个什么样的妈妈啊
Well, what kind of mama you got?

301
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,859
问的好
That's a good question.

302
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,656
让我想想 恩
Let's see. All right.

303
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,454
－我告诉你一些事儿 －好
－I got something for you. －All right.

304
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,698
我从没做过...
I've never had sex...

305
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,373
我从未试过一晚上和两个人做过爱
I've never had sex with two people in one night.

306
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,056
五六个 你的最爱
Six-five, your favour.

307
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,092
懂了
Gotcha.

308
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,411
那么 阿尔菲 你一晚上最多和几个
So, Alfie, what's the most you've had in one night?

309
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,974
我们没在玩游戏是吗
We've stopped playing the game, haven't we?

310
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,611
是我理解错了 还是这里有人在调情挑逗
Am I wrong, or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?

311
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,059
伴随记忆
Driftin' on a memory

312
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,937
我只想同你寻觅
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you

313
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,691
爱着你
Loving you

314
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,770
瞧 如果我有你这样的天分
See, if I had that kind of talent...

315
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,692
这首歌
And a song

316
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,897
－说 继续说完 －如果我有你那样的天分
－Go on, finish your sentence. －If I had that kind of talent,

317
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,578
那样的身材
and I looked like you...

318
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,059
这首歌
And a song

319
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,570
－...我就会展露我性感的一面 －哦 是吗 －在舞台上
...I would be strutting my stuff －Oh, yeah? －On a stage.

320
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,492
相信我 接下来发生的事是我
Trust me, what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind

321
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,737
今晚来时想也没想过的
when I dropped by tonight.

322
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,579
然而 我对自己说
But then I thought to myself,

323
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,854
知道吗
"You know what?

324
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,253
如果这能使她不再对马龙恼火
If this will help her get past her anger towards Marlon,

325
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,531
这应该作为我对朋友的义务 不是吗
I owe it to both of them, as a friend, right?

326
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,334
尽我所能的帮助他们
To do whatever I can to help."

327
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,416
我后来才发现
I find that, lately,

328
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,613
即使对自己撒谎 也是那么的容易
even lying to myself comes easily.

329
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,008
第二天早上 我一直无法忘却昨晚的事
The next morning, and I can't get last night out of my mind.

330
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,613
竭尽全力把注意力转移到别的事情上 任何别的事
Try desperately to focus on something else, anything else.

331
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,251
极力不再去想我好友妻子那性感到难以置信
Anything to get my mind off my best friend's incredibly hot,

332
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,769
我一生之中从未见过的完美臀部
best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life girlfriend.

333
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,854
阿尔菲 阿尔菲
Alfie. Alfie.

334
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,694
－阿尔菲！ －我该装做没听见吗
－Alfie! －Shall I pretend I can't hear him?

335
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,459
伙计
Dude.

336
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,779
－嗨 －要迟到了 要迟到了
－Hey! －Too late. Too late.

337
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,931
－嗨 你慢点 行吗 －嗨 马利 干嘛啊
－Dude, would you slow down? －Hey, Marly, what's up?

338
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,089
马力?
"Marly"?

339
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,895
嗨 听着 我得跟你谈谈 你先哪也别去
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you. You ain't going nowhere

340
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,058
你得告诉我昨晚怎么样了
till you tell me what went down last night.

341
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,699
－昨晚? －是 别敷衍我了
－Down last night? －Dude, don't mess with me.

342
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,736
洛内特怎么了
What happened with Lonette?

343
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,979
你听过"敲门"这个词吗
Have you ever heard the word "knock"?

344
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,653
－怎么了 －什么 没事啊 没事发生
－What went down? －What? Nothing happened.

345
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,491
－我们打了几杆桌球 －老婆在对我冷战
－We had a few shots. －Missus give me silent treatment.

346
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,249
她就不知道 她不说废话那就是上帝保佑了
Little she know, not hearing constant "blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.

347
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,292
继续说 继续说 老兄 那有用
You keep it up. Keep it up, mate, it'll work.

348
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,337
阿尔菲 发生什么了
Alfie, what happened?

349
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,129
哦 真他妈的 老兄 瞧 我
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...

350
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,379
－我昨晚多喝了几杯 －醉了吗
－I drank a lot last night. －Drunk.

351
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,817
恩 我...
Well, I...

352
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,655
我真的...想不起来了
I really... I don't remember.

353
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,294
- 伙计,你一定对她做了些什么 - 没有
－Dude, you did something to her. －No.

354
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,616
哦,得了,你做了 因为今天凌晨四点
Oh, yeah, you did. Because she shows up at my house,

355
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,979
她来我家了 说她希望回到我身边
at 4 in the morning, saying that she wanted me back.

356
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,778
她甚至还说如果我想要更多时间考虑
She even said that if I needed more time,

357
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,138
她完全能理解
that she understood completely.

358
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,812
真他妈神了
How fucking crazy.

359
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,379
这家伙走运了 幸亏有我 马龙赢了
Chalk one up for the blokes. Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.

360
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,496
这意味着他将无罪释放 而我也是
Which means he's off scot-free, and so am I.

361
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,374
这真是个奇迹 太神了 太神了
This is a bloody miracle. That's fantastic. Fantastic.

362
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,651
－拜托 你是怎么对她说的 - 等等
－Come on, what did you say to her? －Look, look.

363
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,528
－一切很顺利啊 －嗨 你到底说什么了
－It's all good. －Come on, what did you say?

364
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,174
我向她求婚了
I asked her to marry me.

365
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,135
你是我最好的兄弟 是吗
You know you're my best man, right?

366
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,971
这个故事的寓意
Moral of the story

367
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,612
万事终有报！
No good deed goes unpunished.

368
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,693
今天的每日一词吗
New word for the day?

369
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,214
"恢复"
"Resilience:

370
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,536
从失望和失败中迅速痊愈的能力
The ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss."

371
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,819
反弹的能力
Capacity to spring back.

372
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,972
明白吗 我不是说为茱利找个替代品
Understand, it's not about replacing Julie.

373
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,888
我只是想回到简单的生活状态
I just wanna get back to the simple life.

374
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,734
女人对我毫无意义
Women who mean nothing to me.

375
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,328
所以我和个叫呜塔的酒吧招待 开始了一段友谊
So I've struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called Uta.

376
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,293
嗨 呜塔
Hello, Uta.

377
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,130
现在 作为一个追求刺激的单身汉
Now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,

378
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,052
我必须遵循一些简单的原则
I have to live by some very simple rules.

379
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,939
阿尔菲.鄂尔肯斯的信条 哲学
Alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy,

380
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,459
也可能是我父亲给我的唯一
which is probably best summed up by the only advice

381
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,337
忠告
my father ever gave me.

382
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,138
他说："儿子 当你看见一个漂亮姑娘...
He said, "Son, whenever you meet a beautiful woman...

383
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,454
记着 在别处一定有个男人已经厌烦了她"
...just remember, somewhere there's a bloke who's sick of shagging her."

384
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,610
－你要什么 －G&T(调和酒) 谢谢
－Can I help you, man? －G and T, please.

385
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,379
告诉我觉得那个欧洲痞子怎么样
Explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash?

386
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,099
我觉得在性体验方面非常不公 男人可以比女人
I think it's incredibly unfair that it's acceptable for men

387
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,852
更放荡 而对于女人
to be sexually experimental, then with a woman,

388
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,059
如果她想要尝试下...比如接吻 三人行
if she wants to try something... A kiss or a threesome.

389
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,934
你知道的 就会有人说三道四 我就不会批判她们
You know, that they'd be judged. I wouldn't judge them.

390
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,814
我觉得如果你俩要接吻 我...我会
And I think if you two were to kiss, I would... I would just...

391
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,571
我会把它看做是一件美好的事
I would just see it as a thing of beauty.

392
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,533
尽管我像很多男人一样生活放荡
Although I'm living every guy's Rat Pack fantasy,

393
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,174
有些事我还是接受不了
something feels a bit off.

394
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,451
并且让我回到了从前的生活状态
And throwing myself back into the old lifestyle

395
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,656
而且不像我想象中的那么顺畅
isn't going quite as smoothly as I'd hoped.

396
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,293
抱歉
Sorry.

397
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,893
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,896
你们继续 别管我
You carry on without me.

399
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,059
噢 亲爱的 我...
Oh, my loves, I...

400
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,938
我不知道怎么回事 平时不是这样的
I don't know what happened. This is so unlike me.

401
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,210
对 你们... 你们还是...
Yeah, you... You two just...

402
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,097
我曾以为没有比死亡更糟糕的事了
I used to think there was nothing worse than death.

403
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,573
然而 无从解释...
Then, from out of nowhere...

404
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,609
无法想象的
...the unthinkable.

405
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,809
现在我真不知道别人会怎么看你
Now I really don't get what everyone sees in you.

406
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,258
这状况总是不断地出现 一次又一次
It just keeps on happening and happening.

407
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,652
或者更确切地说 没反应 又继续没反应
Or more accurately, not happening and not happening.

408
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,936
这从来未试过 呜塔 相信我 从没有
This never happens, Uta. Honestly, never.

409
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,813
真的
Honestly.

410
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,734
浪得虚名..
Not the word around town...

411
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,178
"短小精干"
...peewee.

412
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,976
鄂尔肯斯先生 我叫米兰达.库尔浦
Mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.

413
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,058
米兰达
Miranda.

414
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,819
这个阴茎医生有点娘娘腔
The penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in.

415
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,176
我了解到你有ED (阳痿的术语)
So I understand you're experiencing some erectile dysfunction.

416
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,770
是 我是有点 有点...你刚才说的那个
I am experiencing a little... A little... A little bit of... What you just said.

417
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,170
别担心 我是这方面的专家
Not to worry. That's my area of expertise.

418
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,132
那么 你最近有否经历不寻常的情感压力 鄂尔肯斯先生
So have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?

419
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,169
压力? 感情上的? 我? 不 从没
Stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.

420
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,572
当然 除非你把我最近和茱利的谈话也算在内的话
Well, unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie.

421
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,253
我不能再见你了 阿尔菲
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.

422
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,730
－怎么了 你生气了 －不 真我没有
－Why? You angry? －No, I'm really not angry.

423
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,416
只是 你知道的 我们所追求的不一样
Just, you know, we want different things.

424
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,258
我不能让你在麦克斯的生活中 时不时地出现消失
And I can't have you traipsing in and out of Max's life.

425
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,619
你换发型了 是吗
You've changed your hair, haven't you?

426
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,213
不是吗 不 你换了
You have, haven't you? No, you have.

427
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,291
你是换了发型 你剪短了
You've changed your hairdo. You cut it?

428
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,338
看上去漂亮极了
It looks gorgeous.

429
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,611
－谢谢 －为什么
－Thanks. －How come...?

430
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,378
为什么我们在一起的时候 你从不梳这样的发型
How come you never had it like that when we were together?

431
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,452
我必须得走了
I really gotta go.

432
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,539
哦 我想
Well, I guess...

433
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,973
你得要回这个
...you need these back.

434
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,333
谢谢
Thank you.

435
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,377
阿尔菲
Alfie?

436
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,008
你会没事的 对吗
You gonna be okay?

437
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,650
是的 别担心 我总是很好
Yeah. No worries. I'm always okay.

438
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,652
好吧 我们来检查下你的阴茎
Alrighty, let's take a gander at that penis of yours.

439
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,691
明白
I see.

440
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,853
好
Well.

441
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,534
－看来我们让它有反应了 －好像是啊
－It seems we have lift－off. －It seems we do.

442
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,412
真好
Wunderschon.

443
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,139
这下放心了
What a relief.

444
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,254
我是指 如果他都能让我起来 那我的生育大计
Well, I mean, if he can give me a stiffy, I should have no problem

445
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,259
就应该没问题了 是吧
keeping it up for the target demographic, shouldn't I?

446
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,498
恩 看来生理上没什么问题
Well, there doesn't appear to be anything physiologically wrong,

447
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,253
所以 简而言之 我们可以较为肯定的说
so, in short, we can be fairly certain your problem

448
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,453
－你的问题和压抑有关 －意思是：和茱利有关
－was simply stress－related. －Translation: Julie-related.

449
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,932
就像我常说的 事情不再朝一个方向发展时 那就会朝着反方向发展
Like I always say, if they don't get you one way, they'll get you another.

450
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,892
然而
However,

451
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,453
－我还是发现一些奇怪的东西 －奇怪的东西
－I did feel something a little kooky. －Kooky?

452
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,818
不用过分担心 鄂尔肯斯先生
There is nothing to get upset about, Mr Elkins.

453
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,170
我想你可能有一个肿块...
I thought I felt a lump...

454
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,297
...在你的阴茎上
...on your penis.

455
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,414
如果幸运的话 这不算什么
But with any luck, it will be nothing.

456
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,096
"肿瘤"和"阴茎"出现在同一个句子中
The words "lump" and "penis" in the same sentence.

457
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,855
这可不是每天都能听到的
There's something you don't hear every day.

458
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,933
小阿尔菲获得了一份提前的圣诞礼物
And so young Alfred got an early Yuletide gift.

459
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,895
阴茎活组织切除
A penis biopsy.

460
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,979
我会在三天内得到检查结果... 哦 是五天
I get my test results in three days... Well, five.

461
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,450
天哪 五天 五天后就是周末了 哦 主啊
Five counting the weekend. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

462
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,414
我该怎么才能让自己不发疯呢
How am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?

463
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,735
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

464
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,531
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

465
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,451
我还年轻
I'm a young man.

466
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,053
转移注意力 阿尔菲 转移...
Shift focus, Alfie. Shift...

467
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,455
孩子们 我们走
Let's go, kids. Let's go.

468
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,735
向前走 孩子们 看正前方
Move along, children. Look straight ahead.

469
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,019
别看前面的陌生人 看正前方
Come on. Do not look at the man. Look straight ahead.

470
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,456
此时 我也许还是呆在家里好些
In the meantime, perhaps I'm safer hobbling on home.

471
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,579
阿尔菲 亲爱的 怎么了 你就像死而复生般
Alfie, dear, what's wrong? You look like death warmed over.

472
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,094
没 没 我只是 踢球时受了点伤 没事
No, I've just... I've got a bit of a football injury, that's all,

473
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,178
斯尼特莫太太您好 里贝曼太太 您好
Mrs Schnitman... Hello, Mrs Liberman.

474
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,813
你们看上去好极了 你们去哪
You two look lovely. Where you going?

475
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,814
－买东西 你要带什么吗 －不 不需要
－Shopping. You need anything? －I'm fine.

476
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,089
嗨
Hello.

477
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,897
能谈谈吗
Can I talk to you for a minute?

478
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,179
女士们 这是我朋友洛内特
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.

479
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:39,412
她真可爱 不错啊 和黑人约会
She's lovely. Good for you, dating an African-American.

480
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,413
是啊
Yeah.

481
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,373
嗨 嗨 亲爱的 我想你
Hey. Hey, girl. I missed you.

482
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,215
别理我们 当我们不在 你们继续说
Don't mind us. We're not here. You kids keep talking.

483
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,939
－很高兴见到你们 －再见 里贝曼太太
－Very nice to meet you. －See you, Mrs Liberman.

484
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,453
女士们 买到拿不动为止！
Shop till you drop, girls.

485
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,852
你最近好吗
So how have you been?

486
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,931
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

487
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,052
对我来说
It seems to me

488
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,168
那些我担忧的问题看来都是杞人忧天
the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize.

489
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,290
真正的问题却出乎意料
It's the ones that catch you unexpectedly

490
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,976
在一个周三的下午 犹如当头一棒
on a Wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways.

491
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,368
我提出和她共度难关...
I offered to face the music with her...

492
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,214
...但她想独自承受
...but she wanted to go it alone.

493
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,739
我们都知道如果这个孩子 出生时有任何白人特征
We both knew that if the baby was born with any white-boy features

494
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,334
洛内特和马龙就完了
it would mean the end of Lonette and Marlon.

495
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,058
更别提你们今晚的主角了
Not to mention your host for this evening.

496
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,219
但是站在寒风中 我感到自己心存愧疚
But standing in the cold, I find myself having regrets.

497
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,858
思绪袭来
Thinking thoughts like,

498
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,576
"又失去一个没有机会相识的孩子
"Here's another kid you'll never get a chance to know.

499
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,936
你的孩子"
Your own."

500
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,179
很快啊
Didn't take long.

501
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,135
天啊 你快冻僵了
Bloody hell, you're freezing.

502
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,774
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

503
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,218
空虚
Empty.

504
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,819
那晚在酒吧 我以为我是顺手牵羊的
That night in the bar, I thought I was getting something for nothing.

505
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,811
没想过会搞成这样的 不是吗
Doesn't seem to have worked out that way, does it?

506
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,455
哦 天哪
Oh, man.

507
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,651
如果可以安然度过的话 或许这次与死亡擦肩而过
If everything turns out okay, maybe this little brush with mortality

508
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,929
只是个征兆
is a sign.

509
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,171
我该考虑做... 做一些改变了
I should think about making... Making some changes.

510
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,694
也许
Possibly.

511
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,489
－下周 －抱歉
－Next week. －Excuse me.

512
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,738
我刚是否...你是否刚看了我一眼 我留意到了你又躲开了
Did I just...? Did you just look at me? Did I just notice you turn away?

513
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,050
如果你知道了我的检查结果 他们告诉你了的话...
Look, if you know the results to my tests, and they're telling you...

514
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,019
－鄂尔肯斯先生 －求你 求你
－Mr Elkins. －Please. Please.

515
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,298
鄂尔肯斯先生 我说了一万遍了 请你坐回去
Mr Elkins, for the millionth time, sit down.

516
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,215
鲍尔逊先生 您周二11：30的预约取消了
Mr Belson, I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11:30.

517
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,536
我会没事的
I'm gonna be fine.

518
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,655
－我觉得是这样的 －谢谢 再见
－I just feel it. －Thank you. Goodbye.

519
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,332
一分钟就好 或者十分钟
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.

520
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,569
－没关系 您慢慢来 －我没办法
－It's all right. Take your time. －I don't have a choice.

521
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,618
我以前是小便 现在我是在滴水
I used to pee. Now I trickle.

522
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,773
－我叫乔 你呢 －阿尔菲
－I'm Joe. What's your name? －Alfie.

523
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,894
你过得如何 阿尔菲
So how you doing, Alfie?

524
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,014
－等着呢 你呢 －不爽
－Hanging in. You? －Shitty.

525
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,974
是啊 我也一样 一样
Yeah, me too. Me too.

526
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,779
－我喜欢你的领带 －哦 谢谢 我我有一套
－I like the bolo tie. －Oh, thanks. I have a collection.

527
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,734
你晓得 到你老了 你就会懂得耐心
You know, when you're old, you learn to be patient.

528
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,455
是啊
Yeah.

529
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,894
过去我从没耐心去等 总是往前冲 冲啊 冲
Used to be I never had time for nothing. Go, go, go.

530
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,251
－我懂那种感觉 －是啊
－I know that feeling. －Yeah.

531
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,811
我妻子总是嚷着让我带她 去夏威夷 里诺渡假
My wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation. Hawaii. Reno.

532
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,176
我总是说 明年吧 爱维 明年
I always said, "Next year, Evie, next year.

533
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,530
我有很多事没做
I got too much on my platter."

534
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,169
我总以为我时间很多
I always thought I'd have more time.

535
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,099
然而一个周日的晚上 她从烤箱里取出烤肉
Then one Sunday night, she takes the pot roast out of the oven.

536
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,934
叫着 "汤来了" 但是重重地摔倒在厨房的地上
Yells, "Soup's on," and slumps to the kitchen floor.

537
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,138
就那样
Just like that.

538
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,171
就像迪斯科的衰亡
Dead as disco.

539
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,490
天啊 我很遗憾
Jesus, I'm sorry.

540
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,049
我试着拼凑过去的回忆
I tried picking up the pieces.

541
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,939
甚至独自去了淮基基海滩的8日游
Even went to Waikiki alone on the 8-day cruise package

542
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,896
就是她终日提起的那个
she was always yakking about.

543
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,774
爱维让我难以忘怀
Couldn't get Evie out of my mind.

544
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,094
孩子 生活教会了我两样东西:
There's two things I learned in life, kid:

545
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,098
找到自己的真爱
You find someone to love,

546
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,814
还有 把每天都当做你的末日来过
and live every day as though it were your last.

547
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,338
她是你的了 阿尔菲
She's all yours, Alfie.

548
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,019
享受吧
Enjoy.

549
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,378
你没事吧 孩子
You all right, son?

550
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,697
恩 希望如此
Yeah. I hope so.

551
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,170
瞧 如果你觉得无聊了 或者想找人聊天
Look, if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing...

552
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,650
...可以向我倾诉
...give me a holler.

553
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,970
－你不会打的 －也许会的
－You'll never call. －Maybe I will.

554
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,619
好啊 不错 我们可以一起去酒吧 约会女孩子
All right, good. We'll go to a bar together, hit on some chicks.

555
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,973
没错
Damn right.

556
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,132
谢谢你 乔
Thanks, Joe.

557
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,612
嗨
Hey.

558
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,051
对于艾维的事我感到难过
I'm sorry about Evie.

559
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,459
我们...
We...

560
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,928
...我们并不是那么情投意合的...
...weren't all that fond of each other...

561
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,094
但我们很亲密
...but we were very close.

562
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,769
－如果你能明白我的意思 －我想我明白
－If you know what I mean. －I think I do.

563
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,099
最近我想了很多关于上帝和死亡的事
I've been thinking a lot lately about God and death.

564
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,898
如果圣经课上讲的都是真理
And how, if what they taught me in Bible class is true,

565
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,291
那我可就惨了
I'm really in for it.

566
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,979
不过就目前看 我还不会和撒旦为伴
But I won't be partying with Lucifer any time soon,

567
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,017
因为我的检查结果是阴性！
because my test results were negative.

568
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,528
我能活了！我能活下去了！
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!

569
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,453
我弄坏了我的Prada鞋 但我不在乎
I ruined my Prada lace-ups and I don't care.

570
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,979
别以为我忘了 我要彻底改变生活的誓言
Don't think I've forgotten my oath to completely change my life,

571
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,012
因为我没忘记
because I haven't.

572
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,778
胡萝卜苹果汁加点小麦草
Carrot-apple with a dash of wheat grass.

573
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,534
没错
Yep.

574
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,138
现在 健康是第一位的
Health is now priority number one.

575
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,651
工作计划正在步入高峰
Business plan moves onto the fast track.

576
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,895
－如果你这么说... －今晚在安布罗斯的预演...
－If you say so... －Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...

577
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,892
不 我当然不想说啦 等等 我还有什么
No, I definitely don't want to talk. Okay, hold on, what else have I got?

578
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,818
对 好
Okay, yeah.

579
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,497
好吧 如果我们一定要 那就要吧 但是...
All right, if we must, we must, but...

580
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,452
新的目标 新的开始
New slate. New beginning.

581
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,058
－司机 你叫什么 －阿尔菲 先生
－What's your name, driver? －Alfie, sir.

582
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,295
在这等着 阿尔菲
Wait here, Alfie.

583
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,699
你知道大概要等多长时间吗
Do you know how long you're gonna be, roughly?

584
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,294
－你要到别的地方去 －不 不 我只是想转转活动一下
－You got someplace to go? －No, I was just gonna nip off

585
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,094
－喝杯茶 －那还不如原地待命
－and get a cup of tea. －Look, why don't you just stay put.

586
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,936
好 还是不好
Yea or nay?

587
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,809
好 当然好 我这么认为 真的
A definite yea, I think. Really.

588
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,450
太美了 您不这样认为吗 先生
Stunning. Wouldn't you say so, sir?

589
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,009
抱歉 难道我没让你在车旁等着吗
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you to wait by the car?

590
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,659
我想我该帮助这位女士提包
I reckoned I should help the lady with her packages.

591
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,458
真的好看吗
Definite yea?

592
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,292
我是这么认为的
I think.

593
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,419
一点小问题...
With one minor...

594
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,739
－可以吗 －是的
－May I? －You may.

595
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,339
调整一下
Adjustment.

596
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,654
斗牛士 别指望 下辈子吧
Bullfighter. Another lifetime. Don't ask.

597
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,539
50岁 看上去
Fifty, if she's a day.

598
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,973
但是他们不是说50就意味着女人的第二春吗
But don't they say 50 is the new 40,

599
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,535
难道她不是个活生生的例子吗
and is she not living proof?

600
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,493
我指 看看她 保养的多么好
I mean, have a look. Beautifully preserved.

601
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,094
乳沟像荷兰隧道
And cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.

602
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,618
－好些了吗 －好多了
－Better? －Much.

603
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,449
你选择Chanel真是太有眼光了 再来双性感的粉红高跟鞋
You are so right to trust Chanel. A pair of hot-pink stilettos,

604
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,497
你就可以闪亮登场了
and you're good to go.

605
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,458
－啊 你真是个全职的服务生 －我们尽量
－Well, aren't you Mr Full-Service? －We try.

606
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,332
－他有点生气了吧 －哦 没事 这对他有好处
－He's getting a little pissy, isn't he? －Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.

607
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,976
－你的丈夫比你大很多吧 －他不是我丈夫
－Is your husband a lot older than you? －He's not my husband.

608
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,658
他戴着结婚戒指
He's wearing a wedding ring.

609
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,011
我可从没说过他不是别人的丈夫
Well, I never said he wasn't somebody else's husband.

610
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,818
－后备箱里的东西拿出来 －遵命
－Grab the stuff from the trunk －You got it.

611
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,533
很好
Cheers.

612
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,736
女士 如果你以后需要我的服务
Ma'am, if you require my services in the future.

613
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,731
圣诞快乐 女士先生
Happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.

614
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,213
看看 我的朋友们 那是个真正的女人
Now that, my friends, is a real woman.

615
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,214
聪明 性感 而且...
Smart and sexy and...

616
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,288
你注意到我们之间的短暂调情吗
You noticed the little flirt going on between us, huh?

617
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,772
让我想想
Makes me think,

618
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,739
像这样的女人
if a woman like that, of that calibre

619
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,339
看上我这样一个人
should take notice of a bloke like me,

620
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,417
然后 也许...
then, perhaps...

621
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,809
也许 我太低估我自己了
Perhaps I'm selling myself a bit short.

622
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,692
突然
In a flash,

623
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,534
我有了我的新年决心
I have my New Year's resolution.

624
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,532
更高的目标
Aim higher.

625
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,371
灾难性的. 厄运
Catastrophic. Doomed.

626
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,537
凄凉 大变更
Desolate. Cataclysmic.

627
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,010
买给他一本一日一词做圣诞礼物
Bought him a word-of-the-day calendar for Christmas.

628
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,889
大错特错
Big mistake.

629
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,099
节假日 一年中最大的商机
Holiday season, busiest time of the year.

630
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,374
我努力做生意
I try to run a business.

631
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,577
－怎么了 出什么事了 闻先生 －你的黑人兄弟
－What's the problem, Mr Wing? －Your soul brother.

632
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,891
他辞职了
He quit.

633
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,410
在马龙留给我的信里面 他称我为他的最好的朋友
In the letter Marlon left me, he called me his best friend...

634
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,651
但是为取消了我们的生意计划而道歉
...but apologized for bailing on our business scheme.

635
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,817
他说他现在最想做的事就是让洛内迪开心
He said his whole thing now was to make Lonette happy.

636
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,059
他们突然决定
They decided, on the spur of the moment,

637
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,016
要搬到北部去
to move upstate,

638
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,213
还随时欢迎我去做客
and I had a standing invite to drop by any time.

639
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,133
也许 洛内迪说服了马龙
Somehow Lonette convinced Marlon

640
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,058
我们当面说再见 会是件很痛苦的事
it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person.

641
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,337
并且会使事情更糟
And to make matters worse,

642
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,975
又是每年第二个最寂寞的夜晚
it all dovetails into the second loneliest night of the year?

643
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,090
圣诞夜
Christmas Eve.

644
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,409
一个有着所有熟悉的节日气氛的夜晚
A night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings

645
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,853
无助 郁闷 绝望
of hopelessness, anguish, despair.

646
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,452
不是一个适合独处的日子
Not a great time to be flying solo.

647
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,849
这就是我坚持情侣是不应该在
That's why I'm of the belief couples should never split up

648
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,210
感恩节和1月2日之间分开的原因
between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.

649
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,694
总是保持着一段关系 来帮助你度过那些节日 一直如是
Always have a relationship to see you through the holidays. Always.

650
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,533
不好的是 当然 那就是要送礼物
The downside, of course, being gifts.

651
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,972
我总是怀疑其他人都
Personally, I've always suspected that everyone else

652
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,093
过着比我快乐的圣诞
is having a far merrier Christmas than I am.

653
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,576
不是说我从没真正过过圣诞
Not that I've ever actually had a Christmas.

654
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,979
那是另一部迪更斯小说的情节
That's a whole other Dickens story.

655
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,174
出租车
Taxi.

656
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,899
出租车
Taxi.

657
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,296
劳驾
Excuse me.

658
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,173
抱歉 兄弟 超载是违法的...
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the law for me to carry any more than...

659
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,575
感谢上帝
Thank the Lord.

660
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,935
圣诞奇迹
A Christmas miracle.

661
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,219
好吧 上来吧
All right, hop in.

662
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,337
谢谢你救了我们 我都快冻僵了
Thanks for saving us. I was freezing my little tush off.

663
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,492
别担心 你瞧 我后面已经坐满了
No worries. You know, it's pretty full back there.

664
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,693
－为什么你不... －好主意
－Why don't you... －Good idea.

665
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,014
为何不呢
Why don't I?

666
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,136
嗨 小心香槟
Hey, watch the champagne.

667
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,578
都上来啦
All in.

668
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,734
－他们不会太离谱的 －大家留点神
－They don't get out much. －You wanna watch out, you guys.

669
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,051
不然你们的圣诞袜子里的礼物会变成一块煤块的
You'll end up with a lump of coal in your stocking.

670
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,099
你是英国人
You're English.

671
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,931
我喜欢英国人
I love English.

672
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,536
－你叫什么 －阿尔菲
－What's your name? －Alfie.

673
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,694
想吸一口吗 阿尔菲
You wanna abuse a little substance, Alfie?

674
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,572
不 谢谢 我正想戒掉
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

675
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,613
好吧 就一口
All right. One hit.

676
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,973
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmastime

677
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,094
美国佬有个谚语"随波逐流"
There's an expression the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."

678
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,409
哦 是的 我是有点假期忧郁症
So, yeah, I got a dose of the holiday blues.

679
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,528
但是当这样一个让你 意乱情迷的女孩邀你参加派对时
But when a girl of this mind-blowing calibre invites you to a party,

680
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,329
是时候该随波逐流了
it's time to get going and start flowing.

681
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,339
也许是来的太晚了
Maybe it's the late hour.

682
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,539
也许是蛋青酒太烈了
Maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog.

683
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,048
也许是相互间狂野的欲望
Maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire

684
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,293
带给了我们一个快乐的小圣诞
to have ourselves a merry little Christmas.

685
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,449
无论如何 勾引从未如此顺利
Whatever the reason, hooking up has never gone more swimmingly,

686
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,654
我发现我开始说出一些 不像我自己风格的话
and I find myself saying something highly out of character?

687
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,013
我正在翻修我在曼哈顿西区的房子
I'm renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side.

688
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,529
但是 如果 你
But, say, you could...

689
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,216
愿意将就去我暂租的房子 如果你愿意的话
...crash at my sublet, if you want.

690
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,133
整个假日都看到你
See you through the holidays.

691
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,890
听起来很诱人啊！
That sounds inviting.

692
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,699
那么多年来 终于时来运转了
And so it came to pass, that after all those years,

693
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,057
小阿尔菲终于在圣诞得到了他想要的
little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas.

694
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,213
圣诞假期的12天飞逝
The 12 days of Christmas were flying by

695
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,536
如此的超现实
at a surrealistic pace.

696
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,978
是的 这样的兜风很爽
Yeah, it's been quite the ride.

697
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,494
这份"礼物"是难以抗拒的
The package was irresistible.

698
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,171
一次和性感学生妹的完美演出
A showstopper with a new-school brand of sexiness.

699
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,779
她回头时 谁会不驻足观望呢
Who wouldn't get off on the way she makes heads turn?

700
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,050
再且 我们有如此之多的共同点
Plus, we have so much in common.

701
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:07,294
－她是那么甜美 有趣 个性出众 令人兴奋 －爱慕着你
－She's sweet, fun, original, exciting, －Adore you.

702
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,018
充满了惊喜
Full of surprises.

703
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,372
哦 我差点忘了提了 她在床上棒极了
Oh, and did I mention, she makes a cracking good bed.

704
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,851
我开始想
I began to wonder,

705
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,373
这就是我要的那个...
could this be the one...

706
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,774
那个最终吸引我的人
...who finally holds my attention?

707
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,336
新年快乐
Happy New Year!

708
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,932
在每一段注定完蛋的感情中
In every doomed relationship,

709
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,295
总会出现那种我称之为的
there comes what I like to call

710
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,209
"阿呃时刻"
"the uh-oh moment."

711
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,259
当一些特定的小事发生时
When a certain little something happens,

712
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,013
你会明白那是结局的开始
and you know you've just witnessed the beginning of the end.

713
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,499
然后你会兴致全无 并且去思考
And suddenly you stop and you think:

714
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,254
"啊 冰山就在前面"
"Uh-oh, iceberg ahead."

715
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,058
和尼基一起 这只是那些"阿呃时刻"的
With Nikki, that was the first of many...

716
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,690
第一次
...uh-oh moments.

717
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,974
大多是琐事引起争吵
It began with petty arguments.

718
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,454
然后是间歇性的忧郁
Followed by random bouts of melancholia.

719
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,729
无比的兴奋 狂躁的低迷
Major highs and manic lows.

720
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,178
这个女孩从不知道当她过分地拥有一个男人
This girl never knows when she's had one too many.

721
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,815
并且持续出现不稳定的卤莽行为时
And there had been constant displays of erratic, reckless behaviour.

722
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,614
谢谢 不 不 我无法保证会和她走到最后
And thank you, no. No, I did not have insurance.

723
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,256
但是每次当我开始感觉到 没有必要再继续下去了的时候
But whenever I begin to feel there's little reason to go on,

724
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,331
我还是会提醒自己 我们仍然有很多共同点
I'm reminded that we still have one very major thing in common.

725
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,450
若然 她不再无时无刻地吸烟
If only she didn't insist on smoking before,

726
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,411
未来
after

727
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,336
以及现在
and during.

728
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,975
你何时回家 亲爱的
What time are you gonna be home, honey?

729
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,419
听到了吗
Hear that?

730
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,530
"你何时回家 亲爱的"
"What time are you gonna be home, honey?"

731
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,570
这些近似妻子口吻的话是危险十足的
That's dangerously close to wife-speak to me.

732
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,652
因为我为"晚特餐"做特别的准备
Because I'm making something really special for din-din.

733
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,859
"晚特餐"
Din-din?

734
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,299
我等会打电话回来
I'll call later.

735
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,170
听着 你不觉得那颜色有点太刺眼了吗
Listen, are you sure you don't think that colour's a little bit intense?

736
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,378
－我觉得你有点太显眼了 －小心
－I think you're a little bit intense. －Careful,

737
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,170
你手上都是油漆
because you've got paint all over your hands.

738
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:32,448
而且 你穿着我最喜欢的衬衫在粉刷房间 尼基 别这样
Plus, you're wearing my favourite shirt to paint the house in, Nik. Don't...

739
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,490
抱歉 亲爱的
Sorry, baby.

740
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,692
我要走了
I gotta run.

741
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,979
不 我要走了
No, I've gotta run.

742
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,939
我打赌我能让你多呆一会
I bet that I can make it worth your while to stay.

743
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,933
我知道你能 但是知道吗 我要去接人
I'm sure you can. But you know what? I've got that meeting.

744
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,975
－知道吗 －是的
－Haven't I? －Yeah.

745
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,974
你知道 当像那样一个讯号 没能把你留住 你得小心了
You know you're in trouble when a sight like that can't keep you planted.

746
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,697
当我还在圣.阿尔班念高中时
When I was a boy at St. Alban's Secondary School,

747
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,259
学校组织了一次文化之旅
the school took us on this cultural trip

748
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,171
去了一个
to observe art at one of the...

749
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,457
很大很著名的伦敦博物馆
One of those big famous London museums.

750
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,655
总之 当时我在那里
Anyway, when I was there,

751
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,336
看到一尊希腊女神的大理石像时
I came across this statue of a Greek goddess in marble.

752
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,855
阿芙罗荻...阿芙罗荻特 诸如此类的
Aphrodi... Aphrodite, something like that.

753
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,535
她漂亮极了
Beautiful, she was.

754
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,419
完美的女性胴体
Perfect female form.

755
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,172
雕凿的特征
Chiselled features.

756
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,092
精美无比
Exquisite.

757
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,577
我敬畏地望着她
I stood in awe of her.

758
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,819
最后 老师叫我们集合了 我经过雕塑
Finally, the teacher calls us all over, and I'm walking past it,

759
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,053
与此之际 我留意到女神像的侧面
and on the way I notice, in the side of this Greek goddess,

760
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,293
所有的那些裂缝 缺口 瑕疵
all these cracks, chips, imperfections.

761
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,178
毁了我对她的美好印象
Ruined her for me.

762
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,771
就像尼基
Well, that's Nikki.

763
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,814
一尊美丽的雕像
A beautiful sculpture...

764
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,772
毁了
...damaged...

765
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,251
当然 只有你走近了 才能看仔细
...in a way you don't notice till you get too close.

766
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,776
我对着那个信号茫然了一会
I lost the signal for a second there.

767
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,538
但我不知道
But I don't know.

768
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,299
这只是个人的思绪翻滚而已
It's just a lot of personal stuff going on.

769
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,653
你明白我吗
You know what I mean?

770
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,292
－哦 我知道 －欢迎 阿尔菲先生
－Oh, I know. －Welcome, Mr Alfie.

771
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,054
很高兴见到你 埃尔维司 希望你不介意我进去
Good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope you don't mind me rambling on.

772
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,695
－祝你愉快 先生 －谢谢
－Enjoy your evening, sir. －Thank you.

773
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,133
如你所见 这小子的地位提高了
As you can see, the lad's moving up in the world.

774
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,573
事实是我认识了一个朋友
It's just that I've got this friend who's,

775
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,249
这么说吧 死赖着不走
let's say, outstayed his welcome.

776
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,535
完全正确
Absolutely right.

777
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,614
有些人易请难送啊 我喜欢
It's a lot tougher getting them out than getting them in. I like that.

778
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,055
你永远无法猜到我正要拜访谁
You'll never guess who I'm dropping in on now.

779
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,091
几周前我都无法相信
I wouldn't have believed it myself a couple of weeks ago.

780
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,419
你为什么不直接告诉他们
Why don't you just try being honest,

781
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,810
酒店要调整管理 注入新血
and tell your friend that the hotel is under new management

782
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:19,048
他们得腾出几个位子 你懂我的意思
and that they have to vacate the premises. You know what I mean.

783
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,931
那件和服
That kimono

784
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,412
因为你的低胸衣而美妙
does wonders for your decolletage.

785
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,457
－大话 －很低的领口啊
－Big word. －Big decolletage.

786
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,578
我们为何不喝一杯 然后告诉我你其他的麻烦
Why don't we have a drink and you can tell me the rest of your troubles.

787
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,573
变成我听她的话 转型了
Instead of me listening to hers. That's a change.

788
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,734
知道嘛 对很年轻的人来说 你极富智慧
You know, for someone so very young, you're terribly wise.

789
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,492
暗恋者?
Secret admirer?

790
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,290
其中之一
One of many.

791
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,298
你永远不会送花给女孩子 是吗 阿尔菲
You would never think of bringing a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?

792
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,416
这只会鼓励他们
It would only encourage them.

793
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,577
我去拿酒
I'm gonna make us that drink.

794
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,133
你喜欢喝什么 亲爱的
What's your poison, sweetheart?

795
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,019
我想喝一点威士忌 谢谢 如果你有精品米尔顿的话
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please. Midleton Rare, if you've got it.

796
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,496
我喜欢不时地抛出一些名贵的品牌
I like dropping a fancy brand name in now and again,

797
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,452
让她知道 她不是我唯一的女人
let her know she ain't the only one been around.

798
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,499
为何不把这个制做成"午后苦艾酒"
Why not make this an absinthe afternoon?

799
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,172
太好了
Brilliant.

800
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:25,255
－不知道她在说什么 －你喝过苦艾酒吗
－No idea what she's talking about. －You've had absinthe?

801
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,093
最近没有 不 没有 再说一遍 叫什么
Not recently, no. Remind me, what is it again?

802
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,737
绿仙女 法国印象派的液体毒品
The Green Fairy. The French impressionists' liquid drug of choice.

803
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,578
我还给你准备了你喜欢的小蛋塔
And I got you some of those little egg thingies you like so much.

804
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,659
我提过我一旦喜欢上什么 接下来我就会
I mention I like something once, next thing I know,

805
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,458
把它放在银色托盘里
I get it on a silver platter.

806
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,417
完美 是吧
Perfect, huh?

807
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,815
买这种坐垫得花我一天的工资
Kind of pad I plan to earn myself one day.

808
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,489
简朴优雅 略带一点时髦的格调
Understated elegance with just a touch of the trendy.

809
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,450
她是个时尚疯狂追随者
She's a regular fashionista.

810
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,297
你不必跟她说哪件外套配哪双鞋
You don't have to tell this one which slingbacks go with which frock.

811
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,859
她拥有自己的化妆品牌公司
Owns her own cosmetics company.

812
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,215
事实上 化妆品帝国
Empire, actually.

813
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,659
从在时尚沙龙做面部美容产品起家
Started out doing facials in a fancy salon.

814
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,652
用一点洗颜泥和少许番木瓜混合
Took a handful of mud, mixed it with a dash of papaya,

815
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,330
然后投放到市场 成事 就这么简单
put it on the market, and bingo: All this.

816
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,292
这些东西都是违法的
This stuff is so illegal.

817
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,338
我从布拉格走私了一批
I smuggled a whole batch of it back from Prague

818
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,934
装在李斯特林瓶里
in Listerine bottles.

819
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,773
哦 我看了下你的工作计划
Oh, I checked out your business plan.

820
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,979
－然后呢 －印象深刻
－And? －I'm impressed.

821
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,451
－你看上去很惊讶 －一点也不
－You seem surprised. －Not at all.

822
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,890
因为在这些虚张声势下
Because underneath all that bravado

823
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,539
要打败一个比想象中聪明的家伙
beats the heart of a guy who's a lot smarter than he thinks he is,

824
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,170
但他不会像人们想象的那么骄傲
but not nearly as cocky as he'd like everybody else to believe.

825
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:18,659
我们这是算什么呢  算是建立在哪种基础上呢
What are we...? What exactly are we basing this on?

826
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,175
这种对我人格的剖析
This insight into my personality

827
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,258
将心比心
That it takes one to know one.

828
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,658
什么
What?

829
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,618
我在想如果有一个机灵的小纹身艺术家在这的话
I was just wondering if there's a clever little tattoo artist out there

830
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,898
他可以把"巴布罗"改成"阿尔菲"
who could change "Pablo" into "Alfie."

831
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,768
敬聪明的小纹身艺术家
Here's to clever little tattoo artists.

832
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,892
天啊
Jesus.

833
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,452
我觉得一股热流在往下
It made me feel all warm going down.

834
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,970
那是我做的
That's my job.

835
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,016
你知道他们说什么吗
You know what they say.

836
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,696
说什么
What do they say?

837
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,896
苦艾酒能让情更浓
Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.

838
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,457
哦 太好了
Oh, great.

839
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,253
瞧瞧这
Check this out.

840
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,175
再看看浴缸的尺寸
Have a look at the size of this tub.

841
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,610
她有过两个丈夫 都死了
She's had two husbands, both croaked,

842
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,533
我有种感觉 这里就是犯罪现场
and I have a feeling this was the scene of the crime.

843
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,449
来 亲爱的 洗个鸳鸯浴吧
Come on, baby, let's get wet.

844
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,059
如果她继续这样
If she keeps this up,

845
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,219
改变那个纹身会比她想象中快得多
we're gonna be updating that tattoo of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.

846
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,372
记得小阿尔菲最后是怎样得到他想要的圣诞礼物的吗
Remember how little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas?

847
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,213
期望值别太高
Be careful what you wish for.

848
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,330
还有其他
There's something else.

849
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,974
打盹了吗
Dozed off?

850
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,255
是啊
Yeah.

851
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,775
我想要醒着等你的
I tried waiting up for you.

852
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,528
－接待拖了很长时间 是吧  - 非常久 我筋疲力尽了
－Your meeting ran late, huh? －Very. I'm knackered.

853
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,457
还淋湿了
And wet.

854
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,170
但是
But...

855
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,651
我想我们还是应该谈谈 尼基
...I do want us to have a little chat, Nikki.

856
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,891
好啊
Okay.

857
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,095
当然
Sure.

858
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,655
为什么不谈谈夜宵呢
Why don't we talk over a midnight snack.

859
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,215
我做了烤牛肉和约客郡布丁
I made roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.

860
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,739
那是你小时侯的最爱是吗
That was your favourite as a young lad, right?

861
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,613
来吧 过来看看吧
And check the place out, if you please.

862
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,216
－你的小姑娘辛苦劳作了一番 －我留意到了 看起来很好
－Your little girl worked her fanny off. －I noticed. It looks brilliant.

863
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,732
做得很棒
Really smashing.

864
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,772
－尼基 －阿尔菲 我在想
－So, Nik... －Alfie, I've been thinking.

865
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,772
你瞧这些可爱的小土豆了吗
Will you look at these cute little potatoes?

866
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,777
是 我知道我最近脾气不好
Okay. I know I have been a real handful lately.

867
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:27,576
我不知道 这和我不放心你
I don't know, I think it has to do a lot with me feeling displaced...

868
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,139
不完全信任你有关
...and not totally trusting.

869
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,254
亲爱的 直入正题吧
Sweetie, cutting to the chase.

870
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,817
我不再发脾气
I am gonna do better.

871
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,055
我保证
I promise.

872
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,895
从现在开始起我会按时吃药治疗
I am gonna take my medication religiously from now on.

873
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,213
一切都会好起来的
And everything, everything is gonna be easy and breezy.

874
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,576
听上去不错吧 亲爱的
Sound good? Honey?

875
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,773
来 过来坐啊 等着你开餐
So come, come and sit. A feast awaits.

876
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,577
我吃过了 尼基
I already ate, Nik.

877
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,775
那好
Of course.

878
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,170
不用担心 就当是把剩菜放起来
No worries, we'll have leftovers.

879
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,857
我可以放点牛肉当饭吃
I can whip up a little corned beef hash for brunch.

880
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,329
怎么了 阿尔菲
What's the matter, Alfie?

881
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,536
没什么 我只是...
Nothing. I just...

882
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,410
我脑子很乱...
I've got a lot on my mind and...

883
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,770
－我觉得有点... －什么
...I'm feeling a bit... －What?

884
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,734
冷漠 距离 疏远 还有什么
Cold? Distant? Remote? What?

885
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,374
哦 尼基这一切都是胡扯
Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.

886
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,496
一切发生的太快了
Everything happened so quickly.

887
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:43,898
－我在这方面不合适 －哪方面
－I'm not the best at this sort of thing. －What sort of thing?

888
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,539
我...
I...

889
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,779
不知道该怎么说
...don't know exactly how to say it.

890
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,297
当然能说 阿尔菲
Sure you do, Alfie.

891
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:59,529
甩女孩子你很有经验
You've had plenty of experience dumping girls.

892
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,012
别担心
Don't worry.

893
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,458
我早打算走了
I'm already gone.

894
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,939
真是奇怪
Strange.

895
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,454
即使你知道感情走到头了...
But even when you know it has to end...

896
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,370
但当这一切真的结束时...
...when it finally does...

897
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:28,252
你还是无法避免地感到痛苦
...you always get that inevitable twinge?

898
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,932
我做的对吗
Have I done the right thing?

899
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,054
我必须承认...
I must admit...

900
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,775
我很怀念那种伴侣关系
...I do miss the companionship.

901
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,817
尼基是很惊艳
Nikki was a showstopper.

902
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,019
但是像我又老又丑的Gladys阿姨曾说的
But as me ugly old Aunt Gladys used to say,

903
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,093
外表不代表一切
"Looks aren't everything."

904
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,977
我以前觉得那根本只是胡说
I used to think that was a load of bollocks,

905
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,132
但是最近我一直在想...
but just lately I've been thinking...

906
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,014
...也许那个老太婆说的是对的
...maybe the old bat had something.

907
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,132
茱利?
Julie?

908
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,058
阿尔菲 嗨
Alfie, hi.

909
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,613
真没想到啊
What a surprise.

910
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:01,093
－天啊 我很久没见到你了 自从... －是啊
－God, I haven't seen you since... －Yeah.

911
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,570
你看上去真不错
You look... You look amazing.

912
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,368
谢谢 你也是 你看上去也很好
Thanks. You too. You look good too.

913
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,490
我感冒刚好
I'm getting over a cold.

914
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,815
－不过没事了 对吧 －我很好 我一直都很好
－But you're okay otherwise? －I'm fine. I'm always fine.

915
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,938
见到你很高兴
It's good to see you.

916
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,818
我也是
And you.

917
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,496
嗨 我以前...
Hey, you know, I was...

918
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,133
我很抱歉我们之间发生的那些事
I'm sorry about what happened between us.

919
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:37,209
也很遗憾我们之间那样结束了 这不...
And I'm sorry how it all ended up. It wasn't...

920
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,855
这不太妥当
It wasn't good.

921
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:48,493
麦克司走了 我也见不到你 我感觉差极了
I felt bad about not seeing Max and about not seeing you.

922
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,417
－往事如云 别提了 －挺好
－It's water under the bridge. －Good.

923
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,573
你知道
You know...

924
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,499
我在想...
...I'm wondering...

925
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,330
也许我们...
Maybe we...

926
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,732
我不能保证什么
You know I can never promise anything.

927
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,411
但是你愿意 如果你愿意
But if you want, if you like,

928
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,253
也许我们可以从新开始
maybe we could see each other again.

929
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,296
我觉得可以
It would be okay by me.

930
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,459
不是可以 是很乐意
It would be more than okay, it would be great.

931
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,259
－阿尔菲 我... －怎么
－Alfie, l... －Yeah?

932
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,210
这是亚当
This is Adam.

933
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,459
嗨 你好
Hey, how are you?

934
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,132
－嗨 你好 亚当 －好啊
－Hey, how you doing, Adam? －Pretty good.

935
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,052
－亚当 －是啊
－Adam. －Yeah.

936
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,971
遇见你太好了
It was great running into you.

937
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,131
－你看上去很棒 －谢谢
－You look fantastic. －Thanks.

938
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,815
几点了 我得走了
What time is it? I've gotta go.

939
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,454
我有个接待要迟到了 很高兴见到你 亚当
I'm late for a meeting. Nice to meet you, Adam.

940
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,210
茱利
Julie

941
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:10,497
茱利
Julie

942
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,732
－麦克司好吗 －哦 很好
－How's Max? －Oh, really good.

943
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,375
替我问好
Will you say hi?

944
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:21,333
－好的 －或者不必了
－Sure. －Or not.

945
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,652
保重
Be well.

946
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,532
嗨
Hello.

947
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,816
嗨
Hello.

948
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,139
闻太太 一切还...
Mrs Wing, is everything...?

949
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,098
闻先生
Wing.

950
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,892
你怎么哭了
Why are you crying?

951
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,732
我没哭 出去
I'm not crying. Get out.

952
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:35,055
－你确定吗 －我没事 出去 阿尔菲
－You sure? －I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.

953
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,929
抱歉 我只是想看看能否借辆车
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see if I could borrow a car.

954
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,256
她离开我了
She leave me.

955
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,539
什么
Sorry?

956
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,929
如花 她走了
Blossom leave me.

957
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:50,252
如花 那是你太太的名字吗 如花
Blossom? Is that your wife's name, Blossom?

958
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:54,415
我做错什么了 阿尔菲  因为爱她吗
What I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?

959
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,854
瞧 老兄 快点 你能找回她的
Look, mate. Come on, you can win her back.

960
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:02,259
哄哄她 给她送花 巧克力
Woo her. Send flowers and chocolates.

961
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,854
写诗
Write a poem.

962
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,574
－你这么做的吗 －事实上 不 我从没做过
－That what you do? －Well, actually, no, I've never done that,

963
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:11,137
但是那应该可行
but it may be a way to go.

964
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,856
如花押什么韵
What rhyme with Blossom?

965
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:20,209
我会用 无瑕
I would try "awesome."

966
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,058
好
Okay.

967
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,213
你总是带来惊喜从不间断
You never cease to amaze.

968
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,376
嗨
Hey.

969
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:30,572
很高兴见到你 洛
Great to see you too, Lon.

970
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,936
我应该打电话来的 嗨 山姆
I guess I should have rung. Hey, Sam.

971
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,535
恩 事先知会一下更好
Well, that would have been a plan.

972
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,213
哦 抱歉 我只是
Well, you know, I'm sorry, it was just...

973
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,131
不错啊
It's nice.

974
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,258
瞧 洛内特
Look, Lonette...

975
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,657
这真是很尴尬 你瞧 因为
This is so uncomfortable, I know. Because...

976
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:03,052
你不必那么小声 马龙不在
You don't have to whisper. Marlon's not here.

977
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,179
我真的很怀念你们俩
I really miss you both.

978
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,452
我刚刚在想 也许 ...
And I just wondered, maybe...

979
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,370
也许我和你可以忘了以前的一切
Maybe me and you could put it all behind us,

980
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,493
当作什么事都没发生 像从前那样 你知道吗
pretend like it never happened, and then move forward, you know?

981
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,256
我只是
I just...

982
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,694
你知道的 阿尔菲
You know, Alfie...

983
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,451
忘却不是一个好办法
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.

984
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,056
你们俩没有孩子
You two didn't have a baby.

985
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,890
你们有孩子
You did have a baby.

986
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:49,450
不 你前面那一句是对的(言指孩子是阿尔菲的)
No, you were right the first time.

987
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:20,014
回想起那天在诊所 我记得
Thinking back to that day at the clinic, I remember

988
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,899
我想要从洛内的眼中看出 我是否能理解她
trying to look in Lon's eyes to see if I could even begin to understand

989
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,769
看她经历了什么 但她并不愿看着我
what she was going through, and how she wouldn't look at me.

990
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,730
我想那时我是知道的
And I think I knew then.

991
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,977
我只是不愿承认而已
I just didn't want to admit it to myself.

992
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,574
所以
So classically...

993
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:42,175
...我沉默不语
...I said nothing.

994
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,059
我知道这孩子还是有可能
I knew there was a good chance the baby

995
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,770
是马龙的
could be Marlon's.

996
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,979
至少我那么想过
At least, I hoped.

997
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,537
对我而言...
This is a lot...

998
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,616
我也很希望 洛
...for me too, Lon.

999
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,615
马龙选择留下
Marlon stayed.

1000
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,892
现在是吧
For now.

1001
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,454
我能补偿什么吗
Is there anything I can do?

1002
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,534
你又可以补偿什么 阿尔菲
What are you gonna do, Alfie?

1003
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,209
嗨
Hey.

1004
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,969
你知道 我从没...
You know, I never...

1005
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,491
－我从没想过... －你从没想过伤害任何人
－I never meant... －You never mean to hurt anybody.

1006
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,056
但你做到了 阿尔菲
But you do, Alfie.

1007
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,099
我想我需要有个朋友倾诉
I felt I needed a friend to talk to.

1008
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,699
问题是 突然之间却找不到了
Problem was, they were suddenly in short supply.

1009
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,933
我不记得当时是否在车里 我只是...只是...我就停在那里
And I don't remember being in the car. I just... I just... I was stopped.

1010
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,899
然后我哭了
And I'm crying.

1011
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:34,257
－为那个孩子哭吗 －事实上 我也不知道
－Crying for the little one? －I don't know exactly.

1012
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,136
也许是吧
Maybe for him.

1013
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,735
我想 更多的是为我和
Mostly, I think, for me.

1014
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,930
马龙的友情
And Marlon.

1015
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:49,690
从未有人像那样的看着我
I never had anybody look at me quite like that before.

1016
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,731
相信我 我感觉他恨死我了
And believe me, I've had some looks that could kill.

1017
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,491
他站在洛内迪旁边 我没有 从没有...
He stood by Lonette. I could've never, ever...

1018
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,210
你不会明白你想要什么 除非你真正爱上了一个人
You don't know what you'll do till you really love someone.

1019
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,493
那 接下来呢
Well, now what?

1020
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,295
你会重新振作吗
You gonna shoehorn yourself into the situation?

1021
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:15,773
不
No.

1022
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:19,569
你做了你唯一能做的 你表现的像个绅士
You did the only thing you could do. You behaved like a gentleman.

1023
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,057
我从没被人那样指责
I've never been accused of that before.

1024
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,456
别说的那么伟大 你的行为也不怎么光彩
Don't get all choked up. You also behaved like a scheming,

1025
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,339
背后捅刀子 卑鄙无耻 狗娘养的
backstabbing, so-low-you-can-look-up-a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.

1026
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:33,295
下次拉裤链时 要三思
Next time, think before unzipping.

1027
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:38,450
没事了 你已经搞砸了
It's all right. You screwed up.

1028
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,050
那么 接下来你要做什么
So, what are you gonna do?

1029
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,609
解决问题吗
Run to the bridge?

1030
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:46,330
问题是...
The question is...

1031
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,731
... 你的余生会怎样呢
...what's gonna happen with the rest of your life?

1032
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:20,293
如果我说已经忘了上几个周发生的事
I'd be lying if I didn't admit the events of the past few weeks

1033
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,094
那我肯定是在撒谎
have knocked me for a bit of a loop.

1034
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:32,339
好啦 好啦 好啦
All right, all right, all right.

1035
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,933
嗨 伙计
Hello, mate.

1036
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,533
今晚要些什么
And what can we do for you this evening?

1037
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,692
－这个多少钱 －五块半
－How much are one of those? －Five-fifty.

1038
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:50,454
你要马上放到水里
And you'll need to put them in water immediately.

1039
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,810
好的 我要这个
Right, I'll have that.

1040
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,018
还有个想法
Second thought.

1041
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,655
事实上 有点特别
Actually, this is sort of a special thing.

1042
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,854
－什么场合 －再说一遍
－What's the occasion? －Say again?

1043
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:09,457
－求婚吗 －不 不是
－Proposal? －No. No, no.

1044
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:15,648
也许 我想是有那么一丝目的
Well, I do want to extend an offer to maybe have a go at it for a bit,

1045
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,617
增进一下感情 诸如此类
give us a spin, that kind of thing.

1046
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,937
知道了 表白！
I get it. Commitment issues.

1047
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,257
告诉我 她或他是怎么样的人
Tell me what she, or he, is like,

1048
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,217
我们会找到合适的花的
and we'll find the appropriate bloom.

1049
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,892
恩 她是...
Well, she is...

1050
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,609
你知道吗 她很爱冒险
You know what, she's adventurous.

1051
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:44,171
－浮华 －而且非常性感
－Frivole. －And very sexy.

1052
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,848
我想选"美好人生"吧
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.

1053
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,610
有点调皮 不拘礼节
A little mischievous. You know, cheeky?

1054
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,052
极致诱惑 再配上
Avalanche, with a touch

1055
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,650
爱慕之情
of mio amore.

1056
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:01,697
除此之外 更多的是...
And then under it all, she's just...

1057
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,933
她的甜美
She's just kind of sweet.

1058
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,738
利滋?
Liz?

1059
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,092
－嗨 －是我 亲爱的
－Hello? －It's me, my love.

1060
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:39,939
嗨 我没想到你今晚回来 我以为你在工作
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight. I thought you were working.

1061
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,859
我取消了 所以我今晚有空
I had a cancellation, so I took the night off.

1062
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,499
听着 我想我们可以早点起来 然后离开城市
Listen, I thought we should get up early, get out of the city,

1063
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,536
到乡间去 看看我们是否能
go to the country and see if we can stay

1064
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,494
－住在你常提到的B&B酒店 －我很乐意 但是我不能
－at that B&B you're always on about. －I'd love to, but I can't.

1065
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,498
明天早上我要和投资人吃早餐谈生意
I have an investors' breakfast in the morning.

1066
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,533
－周末呢 －太好了 那样更好
－How about on the weekend? －Brilliant. Better.

1067
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,253
好吧 我想你也许...
All right. I thought you may...

1068
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:02,139
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

1069
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:05,817
不是吧 阿尔菲
No. Alfie.

1070
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:10,418
－哦 多么贴心的示意 －亲爱的
－Oh, what a sweet gesture. －Milady.

1071
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,578
这可不是那些行货 都是我精挑细选的
They're not out of some plastic bucket. I handpicked, like, every bud.

1072
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,419
－我看得出来 －而且我看上去还是有那么点
－I can see that. －And apparently, I have a bit of a flair

1073
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:19,252
组合鲜花的天赋
for flower arranging.

1074
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,459
我太感动了
I'm impressed.

1075
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:25,054
－都说不出话了 －很好 哄你开心我做到了
－Talk about being blown away. －Good. Mission accomplished.

1076
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:29,935
我喜欢给你惊喜
I like surprising you.

1077
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,170
恩 你的确做到了
Well, you certainly have done that.

1078
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:38,373
那么 既然你要早起 那我走了
All right, then. Well, you're up early, so I'm off.

1079
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:42,216
－我们明晚见 对吗 －是的
－I'm gonna see you tomorrow night? －Yeah.

1080
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,173
我们见面时 有些事...
When we speak, there's some things...

1081
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,779
有些事我想认真和你谈谈
Some thing I really wanna talk to you about.

1082
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,611
什么 亲爱的
What, honey?

1083
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:54,651
我要等到那完美的一刻才说 先透露着这么些
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect moment, and that's all I'll say.

1084
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,138
我明早给你电话
I'll ring you in the morning.

1085
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,219
阿尔菲 谢谢你的花 我今晚乐极了
And, Alfie, thank you for the flowers. They made my evening.

1086
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,699
真的吗
Really?

1087
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,812
既然这样 也许我应该留下
In that case, maybe I'll stay.

1088
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,332
我不想...
I don't...

1089
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,730
不要 这不太好
No, it's not a good idea.

1090
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,816
有男人在房间里 是吗
There's a guy in there, isn't there?

1091
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,734
天啊
God...

1092
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,972
走吧
Go.

1093
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:47,292
别这样
Don't do this.

1094
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,974
他哪里
What's he got

1095
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,495
－比我好呢 －阿尔菲 求你
－Better than me? －Alfie, please.

1096
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,770
告诉我 求你了
Tell me. Please?

1097
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:06,859
真的 我真想知道 他哪里好 告诉我
Really, I would like to know. What's he got? Tell me.

1098
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:10,979
我想知道他哪里比我好 求你告诉我
I want to know what he's got. Please tell me.

1099
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:14,575
来啊 来 来 马上告诉我
Come on. Come on. Come on, just tell me.

1100
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,697
马上告诉我 说啊
Just tell me, come on.

1101
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,174
他哪里比我好!!!
What's he got better than me?!

1102
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,375
他比你年轻
He's younger than you.

1103
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,374
"他比你年轻"
"He's younger than you."

1104
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,331
我必须承认 我没预料到这个
I've gotta admit, I didn't see it coming.

1105
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,653
她让我毫无防备 不是吗
She caught me off-guard, all right.

1106
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,815
你也说不清 是吗
You couldn't tell, though, could you?

1107
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:23,657
如同你现在看到的 我宁愿若无其事一样
As you've learned by now, I'm rather skilled at hiding my feelings.

1108
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,937
你瞧 爱情这玩意
You see, the thing with feelings is they have

1109
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:34,735
当你始料不及之际 它静静地闯进你的生活
this quiet way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it.

1110
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,816
你懂我意思吗
You know what I mean?

1111
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,011
是的
Yeah.

1112
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,052
就像利滋
Like with Liz.

1113
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:48,293
谁会想到 在所有我认识的女人中
Who would've thought, of all the women I've known...

1114
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:54,249
这个让我放下防备的 却给了我致命的一击
...the one I let my guard down with delivers the knockout punch.

1115
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,418
讽刺
Ironic.

1116
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,489
日历上的话
Calendar word.

1117
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:12,773
桃利
Dorie.

1118
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:19,771
－嗨 －嗨 阿尔菲
－Hi. －Hello, Alfie.

1119
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:25,219
－我很久没见你了 －也许是你很久没打电话给我了
－I haven't seen you in ages. －Maybe because you stopped calling.

1120
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:29,373
我知道 事情变得有些
I know. Things were getting a bit too...

1121
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,014
别费心解释了 我不想听解释了
Don't bother explaining. I'm way past needing excuses.

1122
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:36,055
好吧 不 你知道我想说什么吗
All right. No, you know what? I want to explain.

1123
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:38,450
什么 你玩厌我了吧
What? You had your fill of me?

1124
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,532
又遇到了比我漂亮的吗 我不想听 阿尔菲
Someone cuter came along? I don't need to hear it, Alfie.

1125
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,939
－瞧 桃利 －真的
－Look, Dorie... －Really.

1126
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,259
瞧 桃利
Look, Dorie...

1127
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,338
发生在我身上的是...
What happens with me is...

1128
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,579
我不知道 我变得...
I don't know, I get...

1129
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,459
当一切变得...不是指亲密 就是之类的事
When it gets too... Not close but something like that,

1130
01:29:55,900 --> 01:30:00,849
我开始觉得  不是喘不过气
I start to feel... Not stifled,

1131
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:04,775
不是被束缚了 好吧 类似这样的感觉
not trapped, but something like that.

1132
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:07,659
然后我...然后..
And I... And...

1133
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,655
你知道 你懂我意思吗
You know? You know what I mean?

1134
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:17,291
这会....这会意味点什么吗
Did that make...? Did that make any sense?

1135
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:21,575
我想 你现在应该比我更明白这点
I think it has to make sense to you more than me at this point.

1136
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,051
是啊 很公平
Yeah, fair enough.

1137
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,973
我要走了 他等着我呢
I need to go. He'll be waiting for me.

1138
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,578
桃利
Dorie.

1139
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,812
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1140
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:55,211
祝你好运 阿尔菲
Good luck, Alfie.

1141
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,969
我从一开始就警告她们
I warned them all from the beginning.

1142
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:17,089
我总是这么说
I always said something along the lines of,

1143
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,257
我必须提醒你
"I must advise you,

1144
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:23,498
我始终坚持着一个忠告
I am stamped with an invisible warning.

1145
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:28,091
我永不忠诚于一 我永不结婚
I will not commit. I will never marry."

1146
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:38,499
尽管我尽力了 我还是开始感到有点内疚悔意
Despite my best efforts, I'm beginning to feel some small cracks

1147
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:42,937
因为我的始乱终弃 
in my faux finish.

1148
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:47,812
当我回首生活的点滴时
You know, when I look back on my little life,

1149
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,534
以及那些我认识的所有女人
and all the women I've known...

1150
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:54,852
...我不禁想
...I can't help but think about...

1151
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:59,493
...她们为我所做的一切...
...all that they've done for me...

1152
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,979
...而我却只付出极少
...and how little I've done for them.

1153
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,609
她们那么关心我 爱我...
How they looked after me, cared for me...

1154
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:10,610
可我却从未回报过她们
...and I repaid them by never returning the favour.

1155
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,778
是啊
Yeah.

1156
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:18,097
我过去常想 我有着最好的分手方式
I used to think I had the best end of the deal.

1157
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:26,775
我到底得到了什么
What have I got? Really?

1158
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,974
有几个臭钱
Some money in my pocket.

1159
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:33,855
名牌服饰 有辆炫车
Some nice threads. Fancy car at my disposal.

1160
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,455
和单身生活
And I'm single.

1161
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:43,135
无拘无束 像小鸟般自由
Unattached. Free as a bird.

1162
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,495
不依赖任何人
I don't depend on nobody.

1163
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,736
也没人依赖我
Nobody depends on me.

1164
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,096
一个人过着生活
My life's my own.

1165
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,973
但心里不踏实
But I don't have peace of mind.

1166
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,138
如果你不是那样想 你便一无所有
And if you don't have that, you've got nothing.

1167
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,899
所以
So...

1168
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,690
所以 什么才是答案呢 我不断问自己
So, what's the answer? That's what I keep asking myself.

1169
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,210
意义又何在呢
What's it all about?

1170
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,450
你懂我意思吗
You know what I mean?

1171
01:33:56,893 --> 01:34:01,893
