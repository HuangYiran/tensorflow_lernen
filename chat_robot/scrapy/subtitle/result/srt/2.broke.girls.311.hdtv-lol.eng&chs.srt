1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,670
总共37分钟!
And time. 37 minutes!

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,300
我们从公寓出发坐地铁
We got from the apartment to the subway

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,360
到糕点学校的新纪录
To the pastry school in record time.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,660
我想说我没穿胸罩
I mean, I'm not wearing a bra

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,500
然后丁字裤也可能穿反了
And my thong may be on backwards.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,260
丁字裤怎么穿都可以的
There's no wrong way to wear a thong,

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,530
只要不会觉得穿着不舒服
As long as it's uncomfortable.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,460
还有 胸罩对你而言就是个装饰
And with you, the bra's just for decoration.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,960
我就得穿了 为此我会拿到一张票
I have to wear one 'cause you get a ticket

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,360
因为我没用胸把孩子们都挤到一个座位上
for not putting the kids in a car seat.

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,130
同学们 一会教室见
See you in class, guys.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,500
我得先跟我老婆道别
I gotta say good-bye to my wife.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,830
你真以为我要亲你?
Did you think I was gonna kiss you?

14
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,200
对啊 我是你老婆 你是我老公
Yes. I'm the wife, you're the husband,

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,560
有一天被我发现你穿着我的衣服
Who I caught wearing my clothes one day,

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,960
但我什么都没说
But I don't say anything about it.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,630
各位早上好
Morning, guys.

18
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,830
Bebe 早啊
Oh, hi, Bebe.

19
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,630
看到我吓一跳 对吧?
Surprised to see me, right?

20
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,300
大家都以为我活不过漫漫长夜
Everyone always thinks I'm not gonna make it

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,630
但我活生生地出现了
Through the night, but here I am,

22
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,700
连我自己都觉得意外
Even surprised myself.

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,530
和一个随时会死翘董事的人
What's it like working in an office

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,600
在一起工作 有啥感觉?
with someone who's about to snap like a breadstick?

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,000
不如你想象中有趣
Not as much fun as you'd think.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,830
但是Bebe人很好 而且在这里工作
But Bebe's sweet, and working here

27
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,260
能让你有钱念完糕点学校
is putting you through pastry school.

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
- 好吧 拜拜  - 拜
- Okay, bye.  - Bye.

29
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,860
- 我要离婚  - 我已提交申请了
- I want a divorce.  - I already filed.

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,370
对了 老婆 我要5块钱
Hey, wife, I need $5

33
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,360
赔偿昨天被我弄坏的抹刀
to pay for a spatula I broke yesterday.

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,400
当时我正幻想着厨神戈登•拉姆齐
I was having a Gordon Ramsay moment.

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,060
顺便说一下 我要和他嘿咻
I'd have sex with him, by the way.

36
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,230
为啥? 他会冲你大声嚷嚷
Why? He'd just be yelling at you

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,000
然后说你做的方式不对
and telling you you're doing it wrong.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,800
是啊 做爱不对
Yeah, sex.

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,030
拿着 在我钱包里
Take it. It's in my purse.

40
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,530
哎 Bebe 你服的那些药
Yo, Bebe, you got any extra pills

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,630
还有没有剩余的啊?
you're not taking?

42
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,730
没有 我全吃了
No, I'm taking them all.

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,360
天啊 不
Oh, my god, no.

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,830
什么 我想要个一两片
What? I just wanted one. Or two.

45
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,060
让我缓一缓情绪
Just to take the edge off.

46
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,260
我三点还有个打发奶油的考试
I have a whipped cream final at 3:00.

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,000
不是 这有个讣告
No. In the obituaries.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
这人我认识
I know this person.

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
Antonia Florentino 享年80岁
"Antonia Florentino, 80,

50
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,260
在梦里平静地离开了人世
Died peacefully in her sleep."

51
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,400
是自杀死的 对吧?
That's a suicide, right?

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,930
她是我的老保姆
She was my nanny.

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,400
你竟然还有老保姆?
You still have a nanny?

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,030
真幸运
Lucky.

55
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,000
小时候一直是她在照顾我
She took care of me most of my childhood.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,960
我很爱她
I loved her so much.

57
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,300
节哀
So sorry.

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,460
我感同身受
That's kind of how I felt

59
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,060
就像我的老邻居Carla
about my old neighbor, Carla.

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,460
我是说 她虽然没照顾过我
I mean, she didn't take care of me,

61
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,700
但我小时候 她经常让我
But when I was a kid, she used to let me

62
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,230
用她的软管喝水
drink out of her hose.

63
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,030
最后一次我见Antonia 是她载着我
The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,930
以及冒牌的妮丽·费塔朵 去参加青少年选择奖
And a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the teen choice awards.

65
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,030
哦 我们可以在工作的时间哭泣啊?
Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?

66
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,360
我之前都是在车里哭的
Cause I only do it in my car.

67
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,300
Max 你知道我意识到什么吗
Max, you know what I just realized?

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,100
这是在我保姆死后
This is the first time I've been here

69
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,130
我第一次踏足这里
since my nanny died.

70
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,660
刚在墨西哥快餐店你说了这个话
You just said that at Chipotle.

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,460
10分钟后你又说了一遍
And then you said it again ten minutes later,

72
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,500
还是在墨西哥快餐店
Also at Chipotle.

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,330
给点同情心啊
Show some sensitivity.

74
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,830
我哭是因为我的保姆死了
I was crying because my nanny died.

75
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,930
而且我们还得在墨西哥快餐店吃早午饭
And also because our grief brunch was at Chipotle.

76
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,930
Caroline 你保姆去世了?
Caroline, your nanny passed?

77
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,430
真可怜 这孩子 真不幸
My sympathies, sweetheart. That's a shame.

78
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,760
但是一个黑人的葬礼是最隆重的
But there is nothing better than a black funeral.

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,430
84年参加完我爷爷的葬礼后 我一直醉到现在
I'm still hung over from my grandpa's in '84.

80
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,560
Earl 我的保姆是个白人
Earl, my nanny was white.

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,630
你保姆是个白人?
Your nanny was white?

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,500
孩子 你以前真有钱
Child, you were rich.

83
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
你见到Han了吗?
Have you seen Han?

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,960
明天葬礼在费城举办
The funeral's in Philadelphia tomorrow,

85
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,330
我要请一天的假
And I need the day off.

86
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,760
我之前好像看到他了
Well, I think I saw him earlier.

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,530
不过也有可能 我看到的是只猫
But then again, it might have been a cat.

88
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,360
我们两个都要请一天假
Hey, we both need the day off.

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
我要跟你一起去 在精神上支持你
I'm going with you for moral support

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,930
我要吃一回费城牛肉芝士三明治
slash my first cheesesteak / I want to ride

91
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,360
我还要像坐破碎球那样 去骑一次独立钟
the liberty bell like a wrecking ball.

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,130
我刚在这本科学杂志中读了一篇超疯狂的文章
I just read the craziest article in this popular science

93
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,330
是关于白矮星、黑洞和天王星的
about White Dwarfs, Black Holes, and Uranus.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,100
哦 不 重新开始
Oh, no. Let me start over.

95
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,300
Han 我们明天要请假 我的保姆去世了
Han, we need tomorrow off. My nanny died.

96
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,560
她就像我的母亲一样
She was like a mother to me.

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
但她不是你妈妈
But she was not your mother.

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,530
还有餐馆明确规定了
And diner rules clearly state

99
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,000
家属去世方可请假
you can only take off for the death of a family member.

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,700
规定还说工作期间不允许喝水
Well, the rules also say no drinking on the job,

101
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,760
但...
But...

102
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,130
好 你去吧
Okay, yes, you can go.

103
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,400
因为在韩国文化里
Because in my culture, it's important

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,830
尊敬长者是很重要的
to honor the elderly.

105
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,660
22岁之前 我都是和一个97岁的老人
I shared a bunk bed with a 97-year-old

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,800
睡上下铺
till I was 22.

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,330
你是睡上面还是下面?
Were you on the top or bottom?

108
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,900
我一直在下面的
Oh, I was always the bottom.

109
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,930
哦 不 让我重新说一次
Oh, no. Let me start over.

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
哎 Caroline
Hey, Caroline.

111
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
我收到你保姆去世的信息了
I got your nanny death text.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,330
出于尊重 我穿了黑色衣服
So I'm wearing black out of respect.

113
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,500
还有 我大姨妈也来了
And also, I got my period.

114
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Sophie 谢谢你 这真好
Thanks, Sophie. That's lovely.

115
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,400
是吗? 你指哪件事?
It is? Which part?

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,260
你知道 那时候在波兰 我保姆去世了
You know, back in Poland when my nanny died,

117
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,160
我如此心碎 都不忍心把她吃下去了
I was so heartbroken, I could barely eat her.

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,760
你吃你死去的保姆?
You ate your dead nanny?

119
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,300
那啥 山羊就是山羊
Well, a goat's a goat.

120
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,960
无论你给它起啥名都没关系的
It doesn't matter what you name it.

121
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,730
那羊肉味道真的很好
It's still good goat meat.

122
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,460
好了 我要去我的御用座位了
All right, I'll be in my booth.

123
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,100
请给我一份金枪鱼三明治和三片痛经药片
I'm going to order a Tuna Melt and three Midol, please.

124
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
等等 我们怎么去那里?
Wait, how are we gonna get there?

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,060
Bebe有车 我们可以问问她
Oh, Bebe said she had a car, we can just ask her.

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,630
我不想跟她坐一辆车
I don't want to get in a car with her.

127
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,430
我甚至都不想跟她说话
I don't even want to get in a conversation with her.

128
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,860
我可以载你
I can drive you.

129
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,300
我们得在我妹妹那停一下
We just have to stop at my sister's

130
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,260
就在巴克士郡 拿个无标记的包裹
in Bucks County, pick up an unmarked package,

131
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,930
然后去康乃狄克州把东西丢下来
and swing by Connecticut to drop it off.

132
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,830
Oleg 你运送的包裹里有非法物品吗?
Oleg, is there anything illegal about this delivery?

133
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,430
没有 就是些鞋子...
No, it's just some shoes...

134
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,230
塞了些可卡因在里面
stuffed with cocaine.

135
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,230
这些鞋子都是用印度大麻做的
Also the shoes are made of hashish.

136
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,400
我现在打电话给Bebe
I'll call Bebe.

137
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,060
好吧 但我要坐后面
Okay, but I'm sitting in the back

138
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,630
因为我可不想这疯女人扑向我
cause I don't want the crazy to get on me.

139
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,060
Bebe 实在太感谢你了
Bebe, I can't thank you enough

140
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,830
载我们去参加葬礼
for driving us to the funeral.

141
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,360
现在才20码 你可以稍微开快一点
We're only going 20. You can go faster if you want.

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,000
是啊 我们刚才被一棵树给超过了
Yeah, we just got passed by a tree.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,760
我很高兴你带上这只神经紧绷的可卡犬
And I'm especially thrilled your nervous cocker spaniel

144
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
加了油 弄得像无线热点一样 和我们上路
with gas and hot spots got to join us.

145
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
好吧 现在你又100码了
Okay, now you're going 100.

146
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,400
我们可以开得稍微慢一点的
We can go slower if you want.

147
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,660
抱歉 我的问题在于 我相当极端
Sorry. Extremes... That's my thing.

148
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,560
有一次 我在一天之内搬到东京
One time I moved to Tokyo for a day.

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,560
- Max 我又感觉很受伤了  - 我懂
- Max, it just hit me again.  - I know.

150
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,330
就像是她给这狗喂了西兰花
It's like she feeds him broccoli.

151
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,530
不是
No.

152
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,030
Antonia真的死了
That Antonia is really dead.

153
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,760
好消息是 根据狗叫声
Well, the good news is, according to yelp,

154
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
她去世的地方 距离著名的
she's dead about two blocks

155
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,100
费城牛肉芝士三明治 只有两个街区
from the famous Philly Cheesesteak place.

156
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,660
Max 尊重下死者
Max, show some respect.

157
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,330
好吧 我不认识她
Well, I didn't know her.

158
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,760
事实上 我认为她是一个会带我去吃
In fact, I only know her as the lady who brought me

159
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,030
费城牛肉芝士三明治的女人
and cheesesteaks together.

160
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,360
尽管我们许久未见 但是对于
Even though we've never met, it'll mean so much

161
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Antonia的家人来说 我的出席很有意义
to Antonia's family that I came out of respect.

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
这对我的治疗师也很有意义
It'll mean so much to my therapist

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,930
因为我走出了我的安全区
that I left my safe zone

164
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,300
而且只带了一只狗上路
and only brought one of the dogs.

165
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
Max 你认为我在念悼词的时候
Max, do you think in addition to my eulogy,

166
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,130
要不要从我的童年日记里添加些内容进去
I should read something from my childhood Journal?

167
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,530
不要 但我知道你还是会那么做
I don't, but I think you're gonna do it anyway.

168
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,360
"1997年 圣诞节早上
"Christmas morning, 1997.

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,730
Antonia用一杯热巧克力 以及
Antonia woke me up with a cup of hot cocoa

170
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,260
我最爱的薄荷棒棒糖 叫醒了我
and my favorite peppermint stick.

171
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,130
然后我们一起打开了圣诞礼物"
And then we opened presents."

172
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,300
1997年的圣诞节早上
Christmas morning, 1997.

173
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,330
我朝我妈脸上泼了一杯冷水
I threw cold water on my mother's face.

174
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,060
新年到来... 她还冻在原地
New year's day... Still no movement.

175
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,000
噢
Oh.

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,500
这是我们的合影 我只有这一张了
This is the only picture I still have of us.

177
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,000
这是我们一起过的第一个万圣节
It was our first Halloween together.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,830
那年我四岁
I was four.

179
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,260
瞧这件她亲手为我缝制的 万圣节鸡宝宝的服装
Look at that cute little baby chick costume she made me.

180
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,400
唧 唧
Peep, peep.

181
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,900
喔 真可爱
Aw, so cute.

182
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,060
开车
Car.

183
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,660
我从来没有什么万圣节服装
I never had a Halloween costume.

184
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,760
我以前就把头发乱糟糟的卷成一团
I used to put my hair in a messy bun

185
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,960
然后一瘸一拐的 挨家挨户敲门
and stumble from door-to-door,

186
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,100
装作是我妈
telling people I was my mother.

187
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,930
这个万圣节 我扮成了我的医生 Michael
This Halloween, I went as my doctor, Michael.

188
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,600
我的狗狗打扮成了他的恋人 Joseph
And I dressed up my buddy here

189
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,100
我们一起出动了
as his lover, Joseph.

190
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,960
结果迷路了
We lost.

191
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,700
Antonia总是在我身边...
Antonia was always there for me...

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,100
万圣节 圣诞节 复活节... 每个节日
Halloween, Christmas, Easter... Every holiday.

193
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,630
真的 每天
Really, every day.

194
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,660
对我来说 她就像妈妈一样
She was really like a mother to me.

195
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,430
那你亲妈在哪?
Where was your real mother?

196
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,460
嘿 这狗是什么品种啊?
Hey, what kind of dog is that?

197
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,860
除了"揭人伤疤"这品种
I mean, besides "sad"?

198
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,760
她妈妈出轨 然后被赶出家门了
Her mother had an affair, got pushed out.

199
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,960
这是她的死穴 别乱戳
That's her hot spot, so don't lick it.

200
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,660
没关系 Max你不用采取安全措施保护我
It's okay, Max, I don't need any protection.

201
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,130
你不用采取安全措施?
You don't need protection?

202
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,130
你怎么和我从前约会的每个男人一样?
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

203
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,800
嘿 Bebe 没错 我妈妈是背叛了我爸
Bebe, yes, my mother was unfaithful

204
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,960
所以她被赶出家门了
to my father, so she was sent away.

205
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,060
但还好我有Antonia照看我
But I had Antonia and she took care of me.

206
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,800
她就是我的家人
She was my family.

207
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,000
你一定过得很辛苦吧 世上只有妈妈好
That must have been hard. Everybody needs a mother.

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,330
我要没妈肯定会疯了
I'd be crazy without my mother.

209
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,230
我每次约会都是我妈开车送我去
She drives me to all my appointments.

210
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,000
但现在你在开车
But you drive.

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
对...
Yeah...

212
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,530
但是我本来不该开的
But I'm not supposed to.

213
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,630
我让Bebe一个人留在车上没事吧?
It's okay I asked Bebe to wait in the car, right?

214
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,330
我觉得她应该会好好的吧 车窗留了缝
I mean, she'll be okay. We cracked a window.

215
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,760
她还有一个狗盆和一个磨牙棒
Yeah, and she's got a bowl and a chew-toy.

216
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,100
来吧 我们签到吧
Come on, let's sign in.

217
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,900
Max 和她家人会面时 我要振作起来
Max, I have to keep it together when I meet the family.

218
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,600
我不能太情绪化
I can't be all emotional.

219
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,230
看 我的手在颤抖 不妙啊
Look, my hand's shaking. This is terrible.

220
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,400
怎么? 我刚才名字没签好
What? It was a terrible signature.

221
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
而且这一页只签了五个名字而已
And there were only five other names on the page.

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,930
不要了
Get rid of it.

223
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,400
"不要了?"
"get rid of it"?

224
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,860
我上过的每个男人都是这么说的
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

225
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,330
Caroline Channing 好了
"Caroline Channing."

226
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,100
给 Max
Here, Max.

227
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,730
噢 看
Oh, look.

228
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,230
这些花 以及这些 都相当好看
The flowers and everything are so beautiful.

229
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,530
完事
There you go.

230
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,900
你签的是"费城牛肉芝士三明治"?
You signed "Phil E. Cheesesteak"?

231
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,460
你让我不许再提起这个
You told me not to mention it anymore,

232
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,230
所以这是用来提醒自己的
so it's just a reminder.

233
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,900
喂 Max 待会儿会有很多人
Okay, Max, there are gonna be a lot of people

234
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,260
会前来和寒暄 所以一会儿你要耐心点
who will want my attention, so please be patient

235
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,400
陪在我身边 当我的支柱
and stand next to me for the occasional supportive lean.

236
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,460
如果有人开始痛哭流涕
And if someone starts to get too weepy,

237
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,800
马上把他们推开
push them out of the way.

238
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,100
因为我不能让这身衣服沾上眼泪
Because I can't get tears on this dress.

239
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,530
明早九点前我还得把这衣服退回给百货公司
It has to be back to Barneys by 9:00 a.m.

240
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,960
你来了
You're here.

241
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,800
我们开始了 Max
Here we go, Max.

242
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,900
我是在和他说话
I was talking to him.

243
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,730
当然了 今天对于我们所有人来说都很悲痛
Of course you were. It's a very sad day for us all.

244
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,300
这也太尴尬了
That was rough.

245
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,400
噢 Max 看
Oh. Max, look.

246
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
这就是Antonia
This is Antonia.

247
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,730
哇 她看起来真的很和蔼
Wow. She looks really nice.

248
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,230
确实
She was.

249
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,260
我不知道她是军人
I didn't know she was in the military.

250
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,900
难怪她能折叠出那种有型的被角
But it does explain those fabulous bed sheet corners.

251
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,560
等等 你不知道你的保姆曾是海军?
Wait, you didn't know your nanny was a marine?

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,130
太糟了 要是我 我就会说
That's too bad, 'cause I'd be all,

253
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,200
"嘿 你们这些小富二代们!
"yo, other little rich kid!

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,860
我保姆能把你们脖子掰断了"
My nanny can snap your neck."

255
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,100
啊 看 这是她的姐妹 Cecelia和Angela
Oh, look. There are her sisters, Cecelia and Angela,

256
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,130
这是她的侄子和外甥
and there are her nieces and nephews.

257
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,260
这上面却没有我
And there is not me anywhere.

258
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
我的照片肯定和其他贵宾的一起
You know, my picture must be in the coffin

259
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,600
被挂在棺材里
With the other V.I.P.S.

260
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,500
如果你是个贵宾 能叫人给咱们上杯酒吗
If you're a V.I.P., can we get some bottle service?

261
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,800
下午好 女士们
Good afternoon, ladies.

262
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,360
我叫Anthony 是Antonia的外甥
I'm Anthony, Antonia's nephew.

263
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,160
这是个悲痛的日子
It's sad day, huh?

264
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,330
的确
Yes, it is.

265
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,830
啊
Oh.

266
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,460
我想我稍微不那么悲痛了
Think I just got a little less sad.

267
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,400
噢! Anthony!
Oh! Anthony!

268
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,630
住手 我们是一家人
Stop. We're family.

269
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,400
我是Caroline Channing
I'm Caroline Channing.

270
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,560
管你是谁 反正你很性感
You're Caroline "hot," is all I know.

271
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,900
你们需要包钱的信封吗?
You ladies need cash envelopes

272
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,000
还是你们有了?
or you guys cool?

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,660
我总是要准备一个现金信封的
I always need a cash envelope.

274
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,830
不好意思 什么的信封?
I'm sorry, envelopes for what?

275
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,900
意大利传统 在哀悼完死者之后
Well, at Italian wakes, the mourners give the family

276
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,330
哀悼者要给死者家属一点钱
a donation after they view the deceased.

277
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,660
所以看一次就要收费一次?
So it's pay-per-view?

278
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,960
这笑话不错
That was a good one.

279
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,160
嘿 你们稍后想一起喝一杯吗?
Hey, you want to go get a pop later?

280
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,860
我们一会就要走的 好了 Anthony
We're leaving right after, but yes, Anthony.

281
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,100
谢谢 我们要一个信封
Thank you. We'll take an envelope.

282
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,360
好的
All right.

283
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,660
她就躺在那
The body's right through there.

284
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,830
直接过去 直接穿过去
Go right ahead. Right through.

285
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,760
Anthony 住手
Anthony, stop.

286
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,260
我真的很紧张
I'm really nervous.

287
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,100
我以前从没见过尸体
I've never seen a dead body before.

288
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,260
我见过太多了
I've seen a bunch.

289
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,260
其中一些尸体是我害的
A couple of them were my fault.

290
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,760
我没有现金
I don't have any cash.

291
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,200
- 你有钱吗?  - 我看看钱包
- Do you have any money?  - Let me check my wallet.

292
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,230
这是密保诺牌密封袋 不是山寨货哦
This is a real Ziploc, not one of those knock-offs.

293
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,700
确保把信封给封好
Make sure you seal the envelope,

294
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,230
让别人以为里面全是25美分
So people think it's all quarters.

295
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,700
Max 要到我们了
Max, we're next.

296
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,230
我很害怕 拉住我的手
I'm afraid. Hold my hand.

297
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,700
拉手? 我们是什么关系?
Hold hands? What are we?

298
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,800
是基督教徒们的第五次约会吗?
On a Christian mingle fifth date?

299
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,700
求你了 Max 我很紧张
Please, Max. I'm nervous.

300
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,630
天啊 谢谢你
Oh, god. Thank you.

301
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,430
没事 现在把我的手还给我
Okay. Now give it back.

302
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,800
想怎样? 刚才已是我交往过最长的恋情了
What? That was just my longest relationship.

303
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,700
还有 我需要把这些零钱放到信封里
Plus, I need it to put this change in the envelope.

304
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,700
噢 她看起来很安详
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

305
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,730
Antonia 是我 Caroline
Hi, Antonia. It's me, Caroline.

306
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,060
我该不该亲她一下? 家属就在那边看着呢
Should I kiss her? The family is right there watching.

307
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,960
我们前面那个女士亲了她
The lady before us kissed her.

308
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,330
亲吧
Go for it.

309
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,730
她看起来不会打你的
Doesn't look like she'd fight you.

310
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,730
好吧 数三下
Okay, on the count of three.

311
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,630
一 二...
One, two...

312
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,230
不行! Max 拉着我的手当我...
No! Max, hold my hand again while I...

313
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,900
我们干了什么?
What do we do?

314
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,760
等等 留在那吧! 我们终究还是要给他们的
Wait, leave it! We were giving it to them anyway.

315
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,460
不能全给啊 这可是买牛肉芝士三明治的钱
Not all of it. That's our cheesesteak money.

316
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,730
留着吧 别管了
Leave it. Come on.

317
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,730
我真的感到非常 非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry about that.

318
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,230
我太紧张了 你懂的
My nerves got the best of me. You understand.

319
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,260
我是Cecelia Antonia的...
I'm Cecelia, Antonia's...

320
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
妹妹 我知道
Sister. I know.

321
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,660
你们长得挺像的
I see the resemblance.

322
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,960
我是Caroline
I'm Caroline.

323
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,030
哪个Caroline?
Caroline who?

324
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,260
哦 Caroline Channing
Oh. Caroline Channing.

325
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,630
哪个Caroline Channing?
Caroline Channing who?

326
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,360
我知道你很难过 我明白的
You're having a hard time processing. Understandable.

327
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,600
今天对于我们大家来说都是沉痛的一天
It's been a very emotional day for us all.

328
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,100
这姑娘哪来的?
Who is this girl?

329
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
你 我在哪见过你
You, I feel like I've seen somewhere.

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,860
你是从罗契斯特市来的
Are you Ricky's girl

331
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,360
Ricky的女朋友吗?
from Rochester?

332
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,800
可以啊 有什么好处吗?
I could be. What's in it for me?

333
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,530
我小的时候Antonia照顾过我
Antonia used to take care of me when I was little.

334
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,730
哦 Antonia是你的保姆
Oh, Antonia was your baby-sitter.

335
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,960
你能来真好
Very nice of you to come.

336
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,460
哦 她不只是我的"保姆"
Well, she was hardly my "baby-sitter."

337
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,200
十年来她悉心照顾着我
She took care of me every day for ten years.

338
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,800
我是Caroline Caroline Channing
Caroline. Caroline Channing.

339
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,700
不好意思 但我不认识你 亲
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are, sweetheart,

340
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,460
但你似乎竭力想要提示我
Though it seems to be what you're hammering me about.

341
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,830
如果你们不介意
If you'll excuse me,

342
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,230
我得来根烟
I need a cigarette.

343
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,800
然后还得把我姐姐身上
And then I got to remove

344
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,200
那些钢镚儿拿掉
some of those pennies off of my sister.

345
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,800
这是棺材 不是许愿池
It's a coffin, not a wishing well.

346
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,330
这场葬礼真让人沮丧
This funeral turned out to be very depressing.

347
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,830
没错
Well, yeah.

348
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,500
室内有尸体 确实很扫兴的
Dead body in the room, generally a buzz-kill.

349
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,060
除非是爱尔兰式守丧
Unless it's an Irish wake...

350
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,160
可以在棺材边上玩啤酒弹珠
then you're playing beer pong off the coffin.

351
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,900
不 我是说 这真是难以置信
No, I mean, how is it possible

352
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,630
她的家人怎么会不认识我?
that the family doesn't even know me?

353
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,000
难道Antonia从来没跟他们提起过我?
Did Antonia never even mention me?

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,500
我们要往好处想
Let's focus on the positive.

355
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,100
Anthony是真心喜欢你的屁股
Anthony really liked your ass.

356
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,460
我和Antonia有过回忆
I know what Antonia and I had.

357
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,160
我们之间美好的回忆
This is what we had.

358
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,330
唧 唧
Peep, peep.

359
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,800
这些都是满满的回忆
That's what we had.

360
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,630
确实很满
Well, that's a lot.

361
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,130
可是我想她的家人
But I guess no one in this family

362
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,100
却拒绝承认 而且很可惜啊
wants to admit that, and it's a shame too

363
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,060
我的悼词写得非常好
because I had a great eulogy.

364
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,530
真的吗?
You do?

365
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,930
是的
Yes. I do.

366
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,430
你想看看吗?
Would you like me to share it with you?

367
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,900
非常想看
I most certainly would.

368
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,460
不会吧 你想给一个
You are not seriously eulogy-bombing

369
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,900
老太太念悼词?
that old lady, are you?

370
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,560
是她想要看我的悼词
She asked me about my great eulogy.

371
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,300
她可能有一百岁了
She's a hundred.

372
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,560
也许她听成了你有很赞的泌尿科医师
She probably thought you said you had a great urologist.

373
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,930
你有笔吗?
Do you have a pen?

374
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,700
我要记一下她的医生的名字
I'm getting the name of her doctor.

375
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,330
不是 夫人 我说的不是"泌尿科医师"
No, ma'am, I didn't say, "urologist."

376
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,930
我说的是"悼词" 很赞的悼词
I said, "eulogy." a great eulogy.

377
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,760
你为什么要念悼词?
Why would you give the eulogy?

378
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,000
因为我是Caroline Channing
Because I'm Caroline Channing.

379
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,460
谁啊?
Who?

380
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,630
Caroline Channing啊
Caroline Channing.

381
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,730
Caroline Channing啊
Caroline Channing.

382
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,930
Antonia曾是我的保姆
Antonia was my nanny.

383
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,300
我家以前很有钱
My family was rich,

384
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,160
但是我爸偷了大家的钱
but then my father robbed everyone,

385
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,560
然后我们就变成了过街老鼠
And we became the scourge of society,

386
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,460
虽然那周被梅尔·吉布森
overshadowed a little bit by Mel Gibson

387
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,800
痛打犹太人给抢了头条
hating the jews that same week.

388
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,560
但你们肯定记得 是吧?
Surely, you remember?

389
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,060
亲爱的 我连自己怎么来的都不记得了
Honey, I don't even remember how I got here.

390
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
难以置信
I can't believe this.

391
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,860
我一直以为虽然小时候
I constructed my entire "happy" childhood

392
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,460
我被妈妈无情的抛弃了
on the fact that even though my mom left

393
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,960
但我的童年是"快乐的"
and apparently didn't love me,

394
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,830
因为有Antonia爱我
Antonia did.

395
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,160
但现在我明白了
And now I get here and I realize

396
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,500
没有人爱我 照顾我只是一份工作
no one loved me, I was just a paycheck.

397
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,760
和她照顾别的孩子没什么两样
One of the many kids she baby-sat.

398
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,530
真不知道我为什么要来
I don't even know why I bothered to come.

399
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,160
我去下洗手间 然后就可以走了
I'm going to the restroom and then we can just leave.

400
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,260
不好意思 嗨
Excuse me. Hi.

401
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,600
我是Ricky的女朋友Max
Max, Ricky's girl.

402
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
我理解你现在很难过
I know this is a hard time for you,

403
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,460
但我朋友也很难过
but it's a hard time for my friend as well.

404
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,030
虽然你从来没听说过她
And even though you never heard of her,

405
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,000
但你可不可以去告诉她
I was wondering if you could just go over there,

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,400
你记得她
and say you just remembered her,

407
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
因为Antonia过去常常提起她?
and that Antonia talked about her all the time?

408
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,800
我知道这话和事实是完全相反的
I know it's a 180 on your original story and a lie,

409
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
我本想给你点报酬的
and I'd offer to pay you for your trouble,

410
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,060
但是我的养老金
but my 401k is laying in that box

411
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,160
全都撒在你姐姐身上了
on top of your sister.

412
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,860
听着 我之所以让你俩留下
Look, I only permitted you two to stay

413
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,700
是因为去年Joe叔叔从屋顶摔下来的时候
'cause your Ricky was so nice to Uncle Joe

414
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,060
你家Ricky没少帮忙
when he fell off the roof last year.

415
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,000
但现在 请离开吧
But now, you gotta go.

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,330
好的 我走
Okay. Be that way.

417
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,060
但你别再指望着Ricky
But don't expect Ricky to pick up

418
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,830
会接送Joe叔叔做渗析
Uncle Joe for dialysis.

419
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,260
Max 你在干吗?
Max, what are you doing?

420
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,830
她家人让我把这个挂上
The family asked me to put it up.

421
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,500
因为他们想起你了
They just remembered you.

422
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,760
哦 天啊
Oh, my god.

423
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,430
我真可悲 你还得把照片
I'm so pathetic, you have to put up

424
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,400
挂上去 以此来安慰我吗?
my picture to make me feel better?

425
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,060
确实如此
In a way, yes.

426
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,900
照片挂在这儿
It belongs up there.

427
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,360
大家都会想知道这个孩子是谁
Who wouldn't want to know that kid?

428
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,600
很高兴认识你 Antonia
Nice to meet you, Antonia.

429
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,100
请不要来找我们
Please don't haunt us.

430
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,030
我们走吧 然后去吃牛肉芝士三明治!
Now, let's hit the road and get some freaking cheesesteaks!

431
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,700
Max 把照片拿下来
Max, please take that down.

432
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,230
太丢脸了
It's so embarrassing.

433
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,530
这里没一个人认识我
Nobody here knows anything about me.

434
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,900
他们也不认识我呢 鸡宝宝
They didn't know me either, chicken.

435
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,730
嘿 你叫谁鸡宝宝啊?
Hey, who you callin' chicken?

436
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,930
她叫我 那是Antonia给我起的小名
Me. That was Antonia's nickname for me.

437
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,400
你知道我是谁?
You know who I am?

438
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,700
当然了
Of course I do.

439
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,400
Antonia的鸡宝宝 唧唧
Antonia's little chick, her peep.

440
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,560
她很爱你
She loved you.

441
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,560
她很开心能给你做那件万圣节服装
And she loved making you that costume.

442
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,530
她在厨房的桌子上摆满了亮片
Took the whole kitchen table up with all those sequins,

443
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,760
但她认为你应当穿得光彩照人
but she knew you deserved to sparkle.

444
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,900
她太喜欢你了 我都忍不住抱怨了
She loved you so much, I couldn't begin to complain.

445
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,130
不好意思 你是哪位?
I'm so sorry. What was your name?

446
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,800
我是Meg O'hara 她以前的室友
I'm Meg O'hara. I was her roommate.

447
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,300
也是她爱人
And lover.

448
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,400
我们共度了30载人生
We were together 30 years.

449
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,660
大兵!
The military!

450
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,800
我就知道 没错吧
I know, right? I mean, come on.

451
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,830
这是在坦克上我抱着她的合影
That's me with my arm around her on that tank.

452
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,360
而她的家人毫不知情
And the family still had no clue.

453
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,030
老牌拉拉... 真酷
Vintage lez... very cool.

454
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,660
Toni会希望我把这些交给你
I know Toni would have wanted you to have these.

455
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,700
哦 谢谢你能来 鸡宝宝
Oh, thanks for coming, chicken.

456
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,600
也许你是这世上唯一一个
You're probably the only person in the world

457
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,860
如我这般单纯地爱着她的人了
who loved her as purely as I did.

458
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,630
Max 来啊
Max, look.

459
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,260
这是圣诞节
Christmas.

460
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,430
这是我生日
And my birthday.

461
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,530
还有全美青少年选择奖
And the Teen Choice Awards.

462
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,130
请节哀顺便
I'm sorry for your loss.

463
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,060
谢谢
Thank you.

464
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,660
请大家吃费城牛肉芝士三明治!
Philly cheesesteaks for everybody!

465
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,530
当你在一辆雪佛兰坐上两小时
And you really haven't lived

466
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,060
带着九份牛肉芝士三明治 车上还有只臭狗
until you've driven two hours in a Chevy

467
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,800
就明白以前的一切苦难都是浮云
with nine cheesesteaks and a gassy animal.

468
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,360
怎么? 我那份在车上吃了
What? I ate mine in the car.

469
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,460
嘿 Earl 你错过了一场葬礼
Hey, Earl, you missed one hell of a funeral.

470
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,730
你真应该来看看
You should have come.

471
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,200
那里有不少八九十岁的辣妹
There were some hot octogenarians,

472
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,230
我肯定被她们其中一位的"老人热"
and I got a definite "jungle fever" vibe

473
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,900
给感染了
from one of them.

474
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,230
姑娘 像我这种年纪的人
Girl, at my age, you don't go

475
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,900
会离葬礼远远的
anywhere near funerals.

476
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,360
要是一不留神被埋进墓穴里
You accidentally doze off, you spend six hours

477
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
还得用六小时的时间爬出来呢
digging yourself out of the ground.

478
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,830
嘿 你怎么样啊 鸡宝宝?
Hey, how you holding up, chicken?

479
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,060
我很好 谢谢
I'm okay. Thanks.

480
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,660
Max 要是有一天我死了
And Max, when I die,

481
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,400
别人去不去我的葬礼我都不在乎
I don't care who else is at my funeral,

482
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,830
只要你在那儿
as long as you're there.

483
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,460
我当然会在场
Of course I'll be there.

484
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,200
凶手一般都会出现 以摆脱自己的嫌疑
The murderer always shows up to throw off the cops.

485
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,130
还有 别浪费钱买骨灰盒
Also, save the money on a casket

486
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,630
只要让我穿着迪奥套装 画着烟熏妆就可以了
and just toss me in a hole wearing Dior and a smoky eye.

487
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,230
如果我太胖... 那就把我火化了
Unless I'm fat... then burn me.

488
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,930
我不想要葬礼
Well, I don't want a funeral.

489
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,160
要是我死了 把尸体放在大炮里
When I die, just shove my corpse into a cannon

490
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,900
把我发射到特朗普赌场就好了
and blow me directly into the Trump Casino.
