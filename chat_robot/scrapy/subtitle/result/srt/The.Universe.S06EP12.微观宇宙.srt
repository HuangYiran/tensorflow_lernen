1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,546
混沌初世，一片黑暗
male narrator: In the beginning,
there was darkness,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,600
接着，发生爆炸
and then, bang,

3
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:07,186
产生了无边无际的
giving birth to an endless
expanding existence

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,480
时间、空间和物质
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:13,423
有一个地方，每天都有新发现
Every day, new discoveries
are unlocking the mysterious,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,906
但它依然极端神秘，让人饶有兴趣
the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,840
它就是宇宙
of a place we call The Universe.

8
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,548
随着科学家们不断地解开宇宙之迷
As they try to unravel
the mysteries of the universe,

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,362
他们正逐渐得出一个令人意外的结论
scientists are coming
to an astounding conclusion.

10
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,445
要了解外部
To make sense of outer space,

11
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,859
就得先了解内部
they need to understand inner space,

12
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,670
微小的物质
the microscopic matter

13
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:39,377
是万物之源
that forms the foundation
of everything we see.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,764
让我们变小数十亿倍
But shrinking down billions of times,

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,244
去到原子和次原子粒子的领域
into the realm of atoms
and subatomic particles,

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,992
进入一个奇异的陌生世界
takes us into a strange unexplored world.

17
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:53,019
当我们下到微观世界
- When we descend
into the microscopic world,

18
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,134
就会发现它是那么的不可思议
we find that it's really weird,

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,802
那么的离奇，让人难以置信
and indeed downright bizarre and unbelievable.

20
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,552
那里的东西
narrator:
The stuff in this universe

21
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,421
远比用显微镜能看到的东西小
is far smaller than anything
we can see with a microscope,

22
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:07,435
但它是整体的关键基础
but it holds the key
to the cosmos.

23
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:12,088
只有了解这个离奇的微观世界
- We can only understand
where we came from

24
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:15,250
才能了解我们从哪里来
if we understand
this crazy microworld.

25
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:18,343
因此，让我们展开一次神奇之旅
narrator: So let's go
on a fantastic voyage

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,356
畅游微观宇宙
into an uncharted world

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,956
这一个未知的世界
known as the microscopic universe.

28

《宇宙之微观宇宙》

30
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:42,425
当人们说起宇宙
When people talk
about the universe,

31
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:46,360
通常都是指跨度数十亿光年
they usually mean
the vast expanse of space

32
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,200
可以通过射线望远镜
billions of light-years across

33
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:52,840
和宇宙成像技术看到的
that they can see with radio telescopes

34
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:55,547
广袤空间
and cosmic imaging.

35
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:00,069
人们会联想到恒星、星系和行星
- They think about stars
and galaxies and planets

36
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,035
以及那里所有的庞然大物
and all the big stuff
out there.

37
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,949
那里有很多天体
- You have astronomical bodies

38
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,136
在万有引力的作用下运转
moving under the force of gravity.

39
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,524
自然规律
- There are laws of nature,

40
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,914
在其背后起作用
and you think that the laws are right,

41
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:15,382
永恒不变
once and for all.

42
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,044
然而，还存在另一种宇宙
narrator: However, there is another universe,

43
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,140
一个看不见的世界
an unseen world

44
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,553
在控制着我们看到的一切
that governs everything we see.

45
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,166
当我们变小数万亿倍
- When we go down in size
trillions of times smaller

46
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:34,740
去到微观世界
to the microscopic world,

47
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:39,030
那里的法则远远不同于
the rules are much less intuitive

48
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:42,942
我们通常对宏观世界的直觉认识
than the ones we're used to
from the large-scale world.

49
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:48,102
微观宇宙的魔法
narrator: The magic
of the microscopic universe

50
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:51,450
就发生在一个亿分之一米
begins at about a ten-billionth of a meter,

51
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,824
或者是原子大小的物质上
or the size of an atom.

52
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:58,668
这种状态下的物质，表现非常不同
Matter behaves so differently at this level

53
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,984
科学家们已经发现其运行的是
that scientists have developed
an entirely new set of rules

54
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,426
一种全新的机制
to describe what's going on.

55
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,199
并称之为“量子论”
They call it quantum theory.

56
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:11,439
这个理论的内容非常特别
And what it says is extraordinary.

57
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,523
电子或光子这样的次原子粒子
- This baseball represents
a subatomic particle,

58
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,146
形状就象我手中的棒球
like an electron or a photon of light,

59
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,748
它们在微观宇宙里
that routinely does all sorts of weird, 

60
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:26,081
构建成各种各样离奇古怪的东西
strange things in the microscopic universe.

61
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:28,704
如果棒球就是次原子
The subatomic version of this baseball

62
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,324
它就能隐身
can be invisible,

63
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:32,872
就能轻而易举地穿过固体物质
can go through solid objects with ease,

64
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,461
能够在同一瞬间去到各处
can be in multiple places
at the same time,

65
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,096
并似乎能够时光倒流
and can seemingly
go backwards in time

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,843
改变过去
and change the past.

67
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,339
这就意味着我把这个微小的棒球
This means I could throw
this microscopic baseball

68
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:48,818
投到一垒和本垒，所花的时间一样
to first base and to home plate
at the same time...

69
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:53,538
或是能够改变似乎铁定的比赛结果
or change the seemingly
predetermined outcome of a play

70
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,356
哪怕比赛还在进行着
while it's still going on.

71
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:58,022
刚才只不过是科幻小说里的说法
Now this-this is the stuff
of science fiction.

72
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,554
但实际上，次原子的事情是真的
But really, we know it to be true,

73
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,260
至少，在技术突飞猛进的今天
or at least, it appears to be true

74
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,027
它看起来真实可信
in our quantum world.

75
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,652
我们因此遇到了各种离奇的事情
We get all sorts
of weird things happening.

76
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:09,514
如果科学家们能够知道
narrator:
If scientists can understand

77
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,540
这些离奇事情的个中缘由
how these weird things work,

78
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:13,333
他们就能把它用在
they'll be able to put them to use

79
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:15,168
我们的日常生活
in our everyday world,

80
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,476
使现代计算机发生彻底变革
revolutionizing modern computing,

81
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,036
甚至可能会让我们在茫茫宇宙间
and perhaps even allowing us to communicate

82
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:22,596
实现即时通讯
across the cosmos instantly.

83
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:26,009
把这些神奇变为现实的关键过程
The key to making
these miracles come true

84
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,761
被称为“量子纠缠”
is a process called
quantum entanglement,

85
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,055
科学家们已经把
and scientists
are already harnessing

86
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,598
这个惊人的发现
this astounding discovery

87
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,918
应用在民用和军用上
for both civilian
and military purposes.

88
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,560
量子物理学认为
- In quantum physics,

89
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:42,493
一个物体发生了变化
what happens to an object over here

90
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,157
就会立即影响那里的其它物体
can instantly affect an object over here,

91
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:49,880
哪怕物体之间相隔数百万英里
and over here could be
millions of miles away.

92
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,740
其原理如下
narrator: This is how it works.

93
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,348
当两个次原子相互作用
When two subatomic particles interact,

94
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,002
它们会发生纠缠
they can become entangled.

95
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,167
这就意味着它们的旋转、位置
That means their spin, position,

96
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:02,108
或者是其它特性
or other properties become linked

97
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,415
通过一个现代科学尚未了解的方法，彼此关联
through a process unknown to modern science.

98
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:09,990
如果测量了其中一个粒子
- If you then make a measurement
of one of the particles,

99
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:13,260
那么你立即能确定
then that instantaneously determines

100
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,888
另一个粒子的状态
what the behavior
of the other particle should be.

101
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,950
相关实验证明
And when the experiment is done,

102
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,559
确实如此
it's found that, indeed,

103
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,099
另一个粒子的量子态
the other particle's quantum state

104
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:26,726
会在你测量对应粒子的量子态时
is exactly determined
once you've made a measurement

105
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,029
被确定下来
of the partner particle's quantum state.

106
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,979
这意味着
narrator: That means if a scientist 

107
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:34,114
如果科学家让一个粒子
observes one entangled particle

108
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,286
按顺时针方向转动
and forces it to spin clockwise,

109
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,048
则与其纠缠的另一个粒子
the other entangled particle

110
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:41,554
将会立即朝反方向转动
will immediately start spinning
in the opposite direction.

111
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,901
这个现象让人不但好奇，还非常震惊
That seems intriguing,
but it's hardly earth-shattering

112
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:50,103
你想象一下，当两个纠缠的粒子
until you consider
that the two entangled particles

113
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,996
被分隔开数百万光年之遥
can be separated
by billions of light-years,

114
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,570
你研究其中一个粒子的旋转情况
and still, the moment
you observe one particle's spin,

115
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,570
就能知道另一个粒子的旋转状态
you've dictated
the other particle's spin.

116
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,423
这真是离奇
- That's weird, 

117
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:06,321
它让人想到信息会从一个粒子
because it may suggest that information
has traveled instantaneously,

118
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:08,235
立刻传送到另一个粒子
faster than the speed of light,

119
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,450
快得超过了光速
from one particle to another.

120
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:14,145
我搞不懂它，也不知道谁会懂
I don't understand it.
I don't know that anyone does.

121
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:18,750
“遥远的鬼魅行为”，爱因斯坦这样来形容它
"Spooky action at a distance," as Einstein called it.

122
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,280
量子纠缠
narrator:
Quantum entanglement

123
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:24,574
不只是人们头脑中好奇的想法
is more than a curiosity
of the microscopic world

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,343
在现实世界里
because the effects
of entangled particles

125
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,322
纠缠粒子已经能被看到、被感觉到了
can be seen and felt in our world.

126
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:35,842
如果科学家能突破某些重大障碍
If scientists can overcome
some fundamental obstacles,

127
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,882
将来有一天，量子纠缠会帮助人类
quantum entanglement could someday help humans

128
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,936
跨越遥远的距离，进行即时通信
communicate across vast distances instantly.

129
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,258
人们时常想着
- People sometimes think that 

130
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,844
量子纠缠会达成人们的渴望
quantum entanglement will achieve the desired goal

131
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,696
能够让信息传输
of transferring information

132
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,785
以快过光速的速度进行
at a speed faster than that of light.

133
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,698
我并不看好它
I don't think this
will be achieved,

134
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:59,290
因为要建立这样的系统
because to set up these systems,

135
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,686
你只能以比光速慢的速度
you had to have brought them there at speeds

136
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,036
携带它们前往目的地
slower than the speed of light.

137
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,473
但谁说得清明天？
But then what do I know?

138
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:05,326
一百年前
A hundred years ago,

139
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,526
人们可没想过上月球呢
they didn't think
that we'd be going to the Moon.

140
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,448
量子纠缠非常有可能
narrator:
Quantum entanglement is far more likely

141
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:14,168
应用在现代计算机的变革上
to transform modern computing.

142
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,553
科学家们希望利用微观宇宙的神奇
Scientists hope to use the magic
of the microscopic universe

143
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,995
去建立强大的新型计算机
to build powerful new computers.

144
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,527
我们去看看这个小家伙能做些什么
- We're going to see
what this baby can do.

145
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,610
在麻省理工学院
narrator: At the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,

146
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:32,904
希斯·罗埃德教授
Professor Seth Lloyd

147
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,050
建造了一台量子计算机的雏形
has helped create a prototype
of a quantum computer

148
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,984
它使用的是量子比特
which uses quantum bits

149
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,157
而不是传统计算机的比特
rather than traditional computer bits

150
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,532
来执行计算任务
to perform its calculations.

151
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:47,439
这个实验室拥有世上最好的超导量子比特
- This lab has the world's best
superconducting quantum bit,

152
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,786
或称昆比特
or Q-bit, in it.

153
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:51,964
在使用昆比特进行量子计算时
And when we do quantum
computations with Q-bits,

154
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,721
量子计算机
we can have the quantum computer

155
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:56,506
可以同时执行多重任务
do multiple tasks simultaneously.

156
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,028
它在做这件事的同时
It can do this,
it can do that

157
00:07:58,054 --> 00:07:59,593
也能做另一件事
at the same time.

158
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,094
它能够做“2+2”
It can add two plus two,

159
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,561
能够做“1+3”
it can add one plus three,

160
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:06,134
也能同时做这两个运算
and it can add those two things
simultaneously.

161
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:10,803
一个单独的昆比特
narrator:
The fact that a single Q-bit

162
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,723
能同时执行许多计算的事实
can perform many calculations
at the same time

163
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,070
让量子计算机潜力无穷
gives the quantum computer the potential
to be far more powerful

164
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,776
这绝非任何计算机可以比拟
than any computer ever imagined.

165
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:24,618
但就象20世纪50年代的传统计算机
Like traditional computers in the 1950s,

166
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:28,622
量子计算机现在还处于婴儿期
quantum computers
are in their infancy today.

167
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,249
庞大的机器占据了许多房间
The machines take up large rooms

168
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,434
只能做非常简单的计算
and can do only the most basic calculations.

169
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,260
可是它们前途无量
But they hold great promise
for the future.

170
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,807
量子计算机是出了名的离奇
- Quantum physics
is notoriously weird,

171
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,854
古怪，还违反了直觉
strange, and counterintuitive.

172
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,902
它利用普通计算机做不到的离奇方式
And so quantum computers use this weirdness
to compute in ways

173
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,610
去进行计算
that classical computers can't.

174
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,022
其主要障碍在于
narrator:
The major stumbling block

175
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,436
如何有效地去编码
is figuring out
how to effectively code

176
00:08:58,462 --> 00:08:59,916
让1和0
classical information-

177
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:03,344
这两个经典的计算机信息
the ones and zeros that computers use-

178
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:06,398
能通过纠缠粒子
in a way the microscopic
universe can process it

179
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,891
在微观宇宙里获得处理
using entangled particles.

180
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,998
一旦科学家有解决之道
But when scientists figure that out,

181
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:15,613
量子计算机会彻底改变世界
quantum computers could transform the planet.

182
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,293
如果你有一台量子计算机
- Even if you have a quantum computer

183
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,090
即使没有非常多的量子比特
with not that very many bits,

184
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:21,600
你也能做许多事情
you might still be able
to do things

185
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,805
比如
Iike break all the codes

186
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:25,553
破解互联网上的所有代码
that people use to communicate on the internet.

187
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,615
或者你能解决有大量可变因素的
Or you could solve
very difficult problems

188
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:32,628
非常棘手的问题
having gajillions of variables,

189
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,788
比如你要弄明白
Iike try to figure out

190
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,655
宇宙大爆炸是怎么一回事
what happened at the big bang.

191
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,908
这些已经让人难以置信
narrator:
That may be hard to believe,

192
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:42,017
但微观宇宙还有更奇怪的事情
but the microscopic universe
gets even stranger.

193
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,390
一个非常著名的量子物理试验
In fact, the most famous
experiment in quantum physics

194
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:51,924
展示了一个物体能够同时出现在两个地方
shows how one object can be
in two places at the same time,

195
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:59,175
这个结果吓了伟大的阿尔伯特.爱因斯坦一跳
a result that startled
the great Albert Einstein.

196
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,726
在探索微观宇宙的时候
As scientists explore
the microscopic universe,

197
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,379
科学家们发现它遵循的原理
they find it's governed by rules

198
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,271
让正常世界里的人
that are often incomprehensible

199
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,648
总是觉得难以理解
to those of us in the normal world.

200
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,301
毫不夸张地说
At the smallest scales imaginable,

201
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:16,874
没有多少人知道
not only does information

202
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,594
还有什么东西能快过光速
appear to travel faster
than the speed of light,

203
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,836
但人类似乎总能明察秋毫
but human observation often
seems to decide what happens.

204
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:30,414
在量子力学上
- It seems like the behavior
of quantum mechanical stuff

205
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,754
你注意它和不注意它
is different
when we're looking at it

206
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,130
其表现绝然不同
than when we're
not looking at it.

207
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:38,838
这个深奥的结论
narrator:
This profound conclusion

208
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:42,772
源自“双缝实验”
comes from performing
the double-hole experiment.

209
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:47,652
在一个世纪前，科学家们开始了首次试验
Scientists first conducted
this experiment a century ago,

210
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,867
让光子穿过有两道狭缝的金属
firing photons of light through
a metal plate with two slits.

211
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:54,080
光线通过狭缝
The light that went
through the holes

212
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,387
投射到后面的屏幕上
hit a screen behind the plate.

213
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,480
我将用棒球来进行
- I'm going to demonstrate the results

214
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:01,107
这个神奇实验
of this amazing experiment

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,840
演示其结果
with a bunch of baseballs

216
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,774
我们为此竖起一道屏障
and a barrier that we've set up

217
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,669
在上面开了两个洞
which has two holes in it.

218
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,016
现在，在正常的世界里
Now, normally, in the everyday world,

219
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,136
如果我把许多棒球扔过任意一个洞
if I throw baseballs
through one hole or the other,

220
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:15,189
它们会在本垒后面的屏幕上
they'll form a predictable pattern
on a screen 

221
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,419
形成一个图案
that we've set up behind home plate.

222
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,793
它们会撞击在这边，或是那边
They'll be in one place or the other.

223
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:23,296
好了，让我们不断投出棒球去形成图案
Now, let's make that pattern
with a whole bunch of baseballs.

224
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,524
我要借助于发球机的帮助
I'm going to use
this pitching machine.

225
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:27,378
这是第一个
Here's the first one.

226
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:28,751
请注意看
Let's see what happens.

227
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:41,928
看到了吗？
Now, you see?

228
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:45,622
棒球从其中一个洞穿过后
The balls landed on the screen
in two bunches,

229
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:50,048
几乎是直线地落到屏幕上，形成两个区域
pretty much along a direct line
from each of the two holes.

230
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:53,915
这结果很正常，完全在意料之中
That's natural. That's what we expect.

231
00:11:57,088 --> 00:12:00,115
但当我们进入到微观宇宙
But when we descend
into the microscopic universe

232
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:01,557
使用电子
and use electrons,

233
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:05,170
这些比棒球小十亿倍的东西去进行实验
which are 10 trillion times
smaller than baseballs,

234
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,677
我们会得到
we get a very different,
odd result

235
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:09,530
非常不同的奇怪结果
when we perform
this experiment...

236
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:15,065
其形成的图案，会让你联想到
A pattern that you would expect
if these were waves

237
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,466
波浪在同一时间里
going through both holes
at the same time

238
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:20,199
通过两个洞，并且发生自我干涉
and interfering with themselves.

239
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:22,786
我们都知道
Well, we usually think of electrons

240
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,027
电子是粒子
as being particles.

241
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,054
那么怎么会表现出波的特性呢？
So how can they exhibit wavelike properties?

242
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,268
实验结果让人百思不得其解
narrator: 
These test results were confounding.

243
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,601
电子在撞击屏幕之前
The electron was a particle

244
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,577
还是粒子
before it was fired
at the screen;

245
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,894
但从屏幕上的图案来看
yet it formed a pattern
on the screen

246
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,881
好象单个的电子
as if this single electron

247
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,483
在同一时刻通过了两个洞
had gone through both holes
at the same time.

248
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,483
难道微观粒子
Does a microscopic particle

249
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,323
自发地克隆自己？
spontaneously clone itself in midai?

250
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,403
经过多年研究
After years of study,

251
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,725
科学家们还不能确定其中原因
scientists still don't know
exactly what's happening.

252
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,618
可能最不可思议的事情
- Probably the most magical thing

253
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,498
就是在量子物理中
is that in quantum physics,

254
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:07,112
一个物体可以同时存在于不止一个地方
an object can be in more
than one place at the same time.

255
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,980
它居然能感觉到两个狭缝
- It actually can sense both slits

256
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:14,140
并冲了过去
and actually go through

257
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,714
也就是说，它以量子力学的方式
and quantum-mechanically feel the structure

258
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,967
知道了两个狭缝的结构
of both slits in the experiment.

259
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,502
大多数物理学家认为，数学是很纯粹的工具
- Most physicists agree
that the math is quite solid

260
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,862
解决问题的能力无可争辩
and leads to solutions that are undeniable

261
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:31,156
而且可以用实验数据来确认
and can be confirmed
with experimental measurements.

262
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:34,849
但发生了什么，如何发生
But exactly what is happening, and how,

263
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,554
才是人们争论的焦点
is a matter of debate.

264
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,678
为了弄清楚
narrator: To try to grasp

265
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:40,731
这个令人惊异的实验真相
this amazing experimental result,

266
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:45,167
科学家们决心观察清楚单个电子
scientists decided to observe
how individual electrons behaved

267
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:47,431
在通过双缝时的表现
when they went through the double slit.

268
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,875
到底粒子怎么能
How exactly could a particle
go through both holes

269
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,375
同时通过两个孔？
at the same time?

270
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,028
科学家们瞪起眼睛去观察
- Scientists got a front-row seat

271
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,778
这些电子或是其它的次原子
to observe the strange behavior
of these electrons

272
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,833
甚至包括光子，它们的的奇异表现
or other subatomic particles
or even photons of light.

273
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,129
这些东西太小，不是真正的物质
Doesn't really matter,
as long as they're small.

274
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,969
人们不仅观察它们
They didn't just look at where they landed

275
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,634
落到屏幕上的情况
on the screen back there;

276
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,472
也观察它们
they also watched the behavior
of the particles

277
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,301
通过双缝时的情形
as they went through the holes.

278
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,958
惊人的一幕出现了
And then they saw something amazing.

279
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,978
在科学家观察双缝的时候
When scientists were watching the holes,

280
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,389
电子表现得象粒子
the electrons behaved like particles,

281
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,500
在屏幕那里形成了
forming the baseball-like pattern

282
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,125
类似于棒球实验的图案
on the screen back there.

283
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,249
但当科学家把眼光从双缝移开
But when the scientists
weren't watching,

284
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:33,907
看到的却是电子象波浪
then the electrons behaved like waves.

285
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,638
它们在屏幕上形成的图案
They formed a pattern that looked like

286
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:40,319
看起来象波形的干涉图
the interference pattern
produced by waves on a screen.

287
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,180
这真是奇怪
That's really strange.

288
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,819
你看到的东西，决定于你是否盯着看
What you see depends on whether
you're watching or not.

289
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:47,124
如果盯着看
If you're watching,

290
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,319
你看到的是粒子象棒球
you see the particle-like
behavior like baseballs.

291
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,221
如果你不是盯着看，就会看到波形
If you're not watching,
you see a wavelike behavior.

292
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:57,221
但你不能两种情况都同时做
But not both at the same time.

293
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:02,124
这种现象只能用震惊来形容
narrator: This was nothing less
than astounding.

294
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,291
人们通过观察
Observation seems to change

295
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:09,068
改变了对次原子粒子世界的认识
the nature of subatomic particles.

296
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,027
不可思议的是，当我们不盯着看
- Mysteriously, when we're not looking,

297
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:14,027
好象是波
things are waves.

298
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:16,704
当我们盯着看，好象是粒子
When we are looking,
they look like particles.

299
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,040
所以电子
So even an electron,

300
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:19,568
在我们眼中只是类似于粒子
which seems to us like a particle,

301
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:22,832
在不盯着看的时候，它呈现波的特性
has wavelike properties
when we're not looking at it.

302
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:25,582
事实就是，当我们不盯着看
- The fact that when we don't look,

303
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:28,215
电子表现为从双缝都穿过去
the electron appears to go through both holes,

304
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,471
但当我们盯着看
but when we do look, 

305
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:32,628
通常只能看到它穿过这个或那个缝
we always see it go through one hole or the other

306
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:35,485
这种现象，我们称为“量子谜”
is what we call the quantum enigma.

307
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,499
观察方式的不同
narrator:
How could our decision

308
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:41,207
我们对于事物变化的判断
about whether
to observe something

309
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,832
是否应该不同呢？
change how that something acts?

310
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,262
这里有一个技术上的说法
There is a technical explanation.

311
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,984
要得出结论
- To make an observation,

312
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:53,445
你必须要考虑系统的因素
you somehow have to interact with a system.

313
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,581
比方说，你用光线去照射它
For example, you have to shine light on it,

314
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,737
那么你的结论就得考虑光线的影响
which then bounces off,
and you observe the light.

315
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:01,366
我们之所以说棒球落在这里或那里
That's how we can tell that
a baseball is here or there:

316
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,038
是因为我们不考虑光线的因素
we bounce light off of it.

317
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:04,845
对宏观的颗粒来说
Well, for macroscopic particles,

318
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:06,693
光线的影响微乎其微
that doesn't disturb them
very much.

319
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,623
但对微观粒子
But for microscopic particles,

320
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:11,678
光的因素
the act of bouncing the light
off of the particle

321
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,428
会引起其位置和移动方式的变化
changes where it is
and how it's moving.

322
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:18,206
所以，在微观世界里
narrator:
So in the microscopic universe,

323
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:20,734
光子与次原子
where photons of light
are about the same size

324
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,353
是一般大小
as subatomic particles,

325
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,518
当它们照亮粒子
these photons have a big impact

326
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,265
我们才能看得见粒子
when they illuminate the particles

327
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:27,734
因此它们有着重要影响
so we can see them.

328
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,780
但这样还回答不了
But this doesn't answer the question

329
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,942
“为什么光只是改变了次原子的方位？”
"Why doesn't the light simply change the direction
of the subatomic particles?

330
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,817
“为什么观察方式不同，看到的情况不同？”
"Why does observation actually change
the nature of what is being observed?"

331
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,553
答案很简单，“不知道”
- The short answer is,
"We don't know."

332
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:50,094
这是量子力学根本性的谜团
This is the fundamental mystery
of quantum mechanics,

333
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,295
它是量子力学为什么特别的原因
the reason why quantum mechanics is difficult.

334
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,714
真是不可思议
Mysteriously, when we look at things,

335
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,303
盯着看，看到的是粒子
we see particles.

336
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:59,174
不盯着看，却是波
Then when we're not looking,
things are waves.

337
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:01,956
这个现象
- This is something

338
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,144
科学家们迄今为止，已激烈争吵了
we scientists have argued
passionately about now

339
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:05,372
将近一百年
for almost a hundred years.

340
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,497
还没有达成一致
And there's still no consensus.

341
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:11,136
这些问题在一个世纪前被提出来
narrator: When they were
first released a century ago,

342
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,816
让最聪明的科学家
these test results
were enough to unsettle

343
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:17,594
也感到十分迷惑
the brightest mind in science.

344
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:21,663
爱因斯坦说
- Einstein said,

345
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,344
“我不相信量子物理”
"I don't believe in quantum physics,

346
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,916
“因为我相信，我不抬头看月亮”
"because I believe the Moon is there

347
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,941
“它还是会在那里”
even when I'm not
looking at it."

348
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,087
爱因斯坦的言下之意
Einstein was of course referring

349
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:33,219
就是说月亮出现的地方
to the implications of the theory

350
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,127
与是否在观察它
that the Moon really isn't anywhere

351
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,941
没有任何关系
until it's observed.

352
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,552
但是，双缝实验
narrator: However,
the double-hole experiment's

353
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,038
令人难以置信的神奇远不止于此
mind-boggling conclusions don't end there.

354
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,517
由于近来的技术进步，科学家们
In recent years, technology
has allowed scientists

355
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:53,816
让这个实验来了一个华丽的演变
to perform a fascinating variation of the test.

356
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,079
把问题扩大到了时间的范畴
Its results call into question
our perception of time itself.

357
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:01,786
这象是双缝实验的
- This is like a high-tech version

358
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,154
高科技版本
of the double-hole experiment.

359
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,829
电子冲向开有双缝的屏障
Electrons are being fired
toward a barrier with two holes in it.

360
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,831
科学家们改为观察
But the scientists
can delay their decision

361
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,330
电子穿过双缝之后
about whether to observe the electrons

362
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,190
撞击屏幕之前
until after they've passed
through the holes,

363
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,760
的相关表现
but before they hit the screen.

364
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,482
这就象我在棒球场上
It's as though I'm on a baseball field

365
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:25,023
把棒球投向有两个洞的屏障
and there's a baseball being pitched toward
the barrier with the holes in it.

366
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:26,912
我闭上双眼
But my eyes are closed,

367
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,855
所以它象波浪一样通过两个洞
so it goes through
and it behaves like a wave.

368
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:33,067
但接下来，在它撞击屏幕前的最后一刻
But then, at the last second
before it hits the screen,

369
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,648
我睁开双眼，专心观察它
I open my eyes and decide to observe it.

370
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,069
在这一刹那
narrator: At that moment,

371
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:41,988
电子就是粒子
the electrons, in essence,
become particles

372
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:44,537
而且从离开电子枪的那一刻起
and seemingly always were particles

373
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,259
它们看起来都是粒子
from the time they left
the electron gun.

374
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,134
所以好象是在通过双缝之前
- So it's as though they went back in time

375
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:54,815
它们及时地后退了
to before they went through the holes

376
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,301
去决定穿过哪一个缝
and decided to go through
one or the other,

377
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,798
它们不是象波一样
not through both,
as they would have,

378
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,162
同时穿过双缝
had they been behaving like waves.

379
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,995
这真让人疯狂
That's really crazy!

380
00:19:05,814 --> 00:19:07,226
其奥妙在于
- That's the enigma:

381
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:11,849
我们选择怎样的实验方式
that our choice of what experiment to do

382
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:17,453
去确定电子当前的状态
determines the prior state
of the electron.

383
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:20,023
某种因素在影响着它
Somehow or other
we've had an influence on it

384
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,634
让它产生时光倒流的现象
which appears to travel backwards in time.

385
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,092
科学家们并没有由这些神奇现象出发
narrator: Scientists
are only beginning to grasp

386
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,814
去开展时光旅行的研究
what these microscopic mysteries
mean for time travel

387
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:34,842
去改变我们世界的过去
and changing the past in our everyday world.

388
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:37,633
但非常确切的是
But one thing is clear.

389
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:40,856
次原子世界的运行规律暗示着
The rules that govern this subatomic world

390
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:43,744
微观宇宙如同科幻小说一般
hint at a universe that's just as mysterious

391
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:45,286
充满着神秘
as science fiction.

392
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:50,758
其实，量子物理可能会让人联想到
In fact, quantum physics may suggest

393
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:54,853
真实事物只不过是想象力虚构出来的东西
that reality is simply a figment of our imagination.

394
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,633
在发现微观宇宙的神奇之后
After discovering mysteries
in the microscopic universe,

395
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,383
科学家们想要尽快去弄清楚
scientists wanted to quickly unravel,

396
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:11,286
去研究和揭示它们
study, and solve them.

397
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:15,544
但当他们试图精确了解
But as they tried to figure out
exactly what was going on

398
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:18,036
这个陌生的次原子世界
in this strange
subatomic realm,

399
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:22,161
他们被意外的事情打乱了阵脚
they found something
completely unexpected.

400
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:26,771
自然界拒绝告诉他们
Nature refused to tell them.

401
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:31,605
在微观世界
- When we descend
into the microscopic world,

402
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:34,299
我们会发现所有需要测量的参数
we find that there's
a fundamental uncertainty

403
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:37,441
都具有不确定性
in essentially all quantities
that we wish to measure.

404
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:40,937
这不是测量方法的原因
And it's not a problem
with the measurement process.

405
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:44,438
而是自然界本身不知道怎样测量
It's that nature herself does not know.

406
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:49,618
这被称为“测不准原理”
narrator: Scientists call this
the uncertainty principle.

407
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:51,299
正如奇怪的名字
And as strange as it is,

408
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,521
它可能是关于微观宇宙的
it may be the most profound concept

409
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,396
最深奥的概念
to emerge from the microscopic universe.

410
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:01,702
我们对事物的认识，不能绝对化
We simply cannot know anything
with absolute certainty.

411
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,021
在平常的世界里
- In our everyday world,

412
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,951
我们自认为了解许多身边的东西
we think we know a lot
about the things around us.

413
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,868
比如
We can actually locate,

414
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,601
我们能找到这个母球的位置
for example, the position of this cue ball

415
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,439
用一定的速度去撞击它
and strike it at a certain speed,

416
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:18,646
这样
which we know,

417
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,230
我们就能让它撞向其它球
and we can use that
to collide it into other balls,

418
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,757
从而开始球赛
and go ahead and play a game of pool.

419
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,382
但如果把所有的东西
But what actually happens

420
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:31,826
都缩小万亿倍，那会怎样呢？
if we shrink everything down
trillions of times?

421
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,496
现在假设这些台球
In that world, these pool balls

422
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,618
就是次原子微粒
are now actually
like subatomic particles.

423
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:42,562
在这个微观领域里
narrator:
In this microscopic realm,

424
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,229
量子物理学家发现
quantum physicists have found

425
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:47,173
由于粒子的波状特性
they simply cannot determine with any precision

426
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,645
他们实在是没法精准测量
where these particles are located

427
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,103
它们的具体参数
because of their wavelike qualities.

428
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,798
而且更奇怪的是
And what's even stranger:

429
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:58,434
如果科学家们试图困住一个粒子
if scientists try to box in a particle,

430
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,465
它总会产生足够的能量
it will always generate
enough energy

431
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:03,464
在它的位置和速度被测定之前
to break out of the box before its position and speed

432
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:04,964
逃出包围圈
have been determined.

433
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,589
“测不准原理”宣称
The uncertainty principle says

434
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:11,381
自然界不会允许它的基本要素
nature will not allow
its fundamental elements

435
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,895
被困住
to be boxed in.

436
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,978
所以在微观世界
- So because in the microscopic world-

437
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,034
因为粒子会受到
because particles will interact

438
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,624
一套完全不同的
with a completely different set of rules,

439
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:22,075
量子物理规则的影响
the rules of quantum physics,

440
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:25,492
微型台球带来的是一场完全不同的球赛
microscopic pool will be
a completely different game.

441

442
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,506
微观宇宙的不确定性
narrator: The uncertainty
of the microscopic universe

443
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:39,522
使粒子位置的范围弹性很大
extends far beyond the location of particles.

444
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:43,825
这也适用于每一样东西，包括粒子的能量
It applies to everything,
including a particle's energy.

445
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:46,728
由此引发了一个令人震惊的
And this gives rise
to a stunning phenomenon

446
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:49,144
被称为“量子隧道”的现象
called quantum tunneling.

447
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,380
在经典物理学上
- In classical physics,

448
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,228
如果你把球投向墙壁
if you throw a ball at a wall

449
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,978
由于你的力度不足够大
and you don't throw it hard enough,

450
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:58,325
它穿透不了墙壁，会反弹回来
it won't go through the wall;
it will bounce back.

451
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:00,667
但如果它是一个电子
But if it's an electron

452
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:02,081
虽然你用的力度
and you don't throw it hard enough

453
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,269
也不足以让它穿透墙壁
to go through the wall,

454
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:07,352
但它会穿透过去
it might go through anyway.

455
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,880
这就是“量子隧道”现象
We call that quantum tunneling.

456
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,345
这怎么可能呢？
narrator:
How can this be possible?

457
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,866
它听起来很离奇
It may sound bizarre,

458
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:16,060
唯一的解释就是
but one way to explain
quantum tunneling

459
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:18,866
微观宇宙的不确定性
is that the uncertainty
of the microscopic universe

460
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:21,019
允许粒子从未来借取能量
allows a particle to borrow energy

461
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:23,603
去冲破障碍
from the future to breach the barrier

462
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,991
在到达另一边之后
and then pay it back

463
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,310
再把能量还回去
after it gets to the other side.

464
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:31,074
电子的确是到达了
- The electron actually already is

465
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,109
墙壁的另一边
on the other side of the wall,

466
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,237
因此，它能够穿越墙壁
and therefore,
it can go through it

467
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,659
并出现在另一边
and appear on the other side of the wall.

468
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,393
自从一个世纪前
narrator:
Ever since these wonders

469
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:47,046
这种微观世界的奇妙被发现以来
of the microscopic world
were discovered a century ago,

470
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:49,657
人们想象着，量子隧道
people have asked if quantum tunneling-

471
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:54,199
加上同时出现在多个地方
being in multiple places at the same time

472
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,058
以及时光倒流的特性
and what appears to be
traveling backwards in time-

473
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,754
能否让我们的日常世界趋向完美
can be achieved in our everyday world.

474
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:04,226
一些科学家说，我们永远不能
Some scientists say
we'll never be able

475
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:07,518
让棒球穿过坚固的障碍
to throw a baseball through a solid barrier.

476
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:12,156
一个棒球由数量庞大的粒子构成
- A baseball is a huge number of particles.

477
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:14,768
你要让所有的粒子
You would need all of them

478
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:18,367
全体突然地出现在另一边
to collectively suddenly appear in another place

479
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:22,087
这个棒球才能作为一个整体出现在另一边
for the baseball, as a whole,
to appear in another place.

480
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:25,004
这是绝不可能的事情
And that's just extraordinarily unlikely.

481
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:28,532
单个的电子或质子可以这样做
A single electron or a single proton can do this.

482
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:30,059
但大的微粒
But the bigger your particle,

483
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,143
或者是微粒的大集合
or the bigger the collection of particles,

484
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,684
发生隧道效应非常困难
the more difficult that process of tunneling is.

485
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:39,254
然而，越来越多的物理学家
narrator: However,
a growing number of physicists

486
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,726
正在发展一个更反常的理论
are developing a more outrageous theory

487
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:43,656
去解释发生的事情
for what's going on.

488
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,837
这些微小的粒子
- We know that these tiny particles

489
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:50,527
能够在两个地方同时出现
can be in two places at the same time.

490
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,281
而我是由这些粒子构成的
But, hey, I'm made
of these kinds of particles.

491
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,587
那么我也能在两个地方同时出现
So if they can be
in two places at once, so can I.

492
00:24:57,781 --> 00:24:59,281
科学家称这种理论为
narrator: Scientists call this

493
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:02,961
量子物理的多世界理论
the many-worlds interpretation
of quantum physics.

494
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:08,156
他们说，就象双缝实验中的电子
They say, just like the electron
in the double-hole experiment,

495
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:12,364
人类也能同时存在于多个地方
human beings are all in multiple
places at the same time.

496
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,845
在任何时候、任何一个“我”做了一个决定
They say anytime anyone makes a decision,

497
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:20,225
实际上不是跳过其它的“我”来做决定
we don't actually choose
one option over another.

498
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,728
相反地，是“我们”一起做决定
Instead, we do them both,

499
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:28,836
只是在发生的过程中，有轻微的差异
in slightly different versions of reality.

500
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:31,669
你用头脑思考
- What happens when you use your mind

501
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,419
然后下决心
and your will
to decide things is,

502
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:36,782
最后作出许多抉择
you end up actually
making many choices at once,

503
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,892
所有的这些会被不同的平行宇宙了解到
and all of them become realized
in different parallel universes.

504
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:45,120
按照量子物理的多世界假说
- The many-worlds hypothesis
of quantum physics

505
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:47,461
我在这个宇宙世界里
says that when I throw a curveball,

506
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,837
投出了一个弧线球
I do so
only in this universe.

507
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:53,378
在另一个宇宙，我可能投出的是快球
In another universe,
I might be throwing a fastball.

508
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:55,086
而在另外的又一个宇宙
And in still another one,
I throw a knuckleball

509
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:57,780
我投出了平生第一个不旋转的球
for the first time in my life.

510
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:00,002
在另外另外的宇宙
And in yet another universe,

511
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,516
我把球投出了界外
I heave this ball
to the outfield.

512
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:05,264
在多世界假说中
In the many-worlds hypothesis,

513
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:07,604
所有这些选择
all of these choices are outcomes

514
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:11,317
都是在平行宇宙里发生的结果
that occur in universes
that are parallel to our own-

515
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,141
不只是发生在我们的世界里
just not in ours, but in parallel universes.

516
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,946
这就是多世界假说告诉我们的事情
That's what the many-worlds
hypothesis tells us.

517
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:20,363
这好象是牵强附会
narrator: This may sound far-fetched,

518
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:23,033
但理论物理的许多演算表明
but an impressive array
of theoretical physicists

519
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:26,766
它就是微观世界运转的法则
believe it's the way
the microscopic world works.

520
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:31,921
如果它正确，这个惊人的理论所牵涉的
If it's true, the implications
of this startling theory

521
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:34,668
就远不是棒球场这么简单了
go far beyond the baseball diamond.

522
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:40,585
在本质上，它暗示着
In essence, it suggests there are universes

523
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:43,363
存在这样的宇宙
parallel to our own in which

524
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:47,113
纳粹打赢了二战
the Nazis won World War II.

525
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:51,891
或是美国政府
And in another, the American government

526
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:54,335
挫败了911劫机者
foiled the 9/1 1 hijackers.

527
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,432
世贸中心依然屹立在曼哈顿
So the world trade center
still stands in Manhattan.

528
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,615
如果从表面去理解量子力学
- If you take quantum mechanics
absolutely at face value,

529
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,724
带着量子力学的思维
it says that every time
you observe

530
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,279
去观察每一样事物
something quantum-mechanical,

531
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:10,571
你会发现有两个不同的你
you become two different copies
of yourself.

532
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:13,223
一个这样做
There's the copy
that got one answer

533
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,709
另一个那样做
and a copy
that got another answer.

534
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,973
这暗示着其实有许多不同的
It just implies there's a huge number

535
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:20,181
你本人的拷贝
of other copies of you

536
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:21,834
在各自的宇宙里
that saw slightly different
things happen

537
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,126
有着轻微不同的际遇
in the universe.

538
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,626
目前，微观世界的古怪
- These days, it's completely accepted

539
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:28,768
已经被人们完全接受
that the microworld is weird.

540
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,933
许多人希望这种古怪
Many people had hoped
that this weirdness

541
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,102
能被局限在微观世界里
could be confined to the microworld

542
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:36,318
让我们这些庞然大物不受影响
so that big things like us
would be immune to it

543
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,945
总是存在于单一的地方
and always be in a single place.

544
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,973
但现实告诉我们，这种想法...
But it's become clear now
that that hope...

545
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,890
很幼稚
Was naive.

546
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,534
这种古怪是不受限制的
The weirdness can't be confined.

547
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,278
让人如痴如醉的
narrator:
The fascinating debate

548
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,987
关于多世界理论的
about the many-worlds interpretation

549
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:56,264
剧烈争论会持续下去
of quantum physics

550
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:59,153
除非物理学家们全部解开
will rage until physicists finally solve

551
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,420
微观宇宙的奥秘
the mysteries of the microscopic universe.

552
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:07,445
然而，一些天文学家断定
However, some astronomers are concluding

553
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:09,597
我们永远不能充分解释
that we will never
be able to fully explain

554
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:11,140
这些奥秘的任何一个
any of these mysteries,

555
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,480
这是因为，按照他们的计算
because, according
to their calculations,

556
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:17,022
大多数主宰着宇宙的物质
the vast majority of matter
holding the universe together

557
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,898
以我们永远无法解释的大尺寸方式存在着
exists in a higher dimension
that we can never explore.

558
00:28:27,486 --> 00:28:30,030
如果微观世界里
If there's anything
in the microscopic universe

559
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:32,389
还存在着比量子微粒更奇怪
stranger than quantum particles,

560
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:37,038
属于从未被科学家发现过的神秘物质
it's the mysterious matter
that scientists have never seen

561
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:40,837
就会在太阳系、银河系这些天体的构成中
but that plays a crucial role
in the formation of planets,

562
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:44,736
表现出关键性的作用
solar systems, and galaxies.

563
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,611
天文学家确信，宇宙里存在这样的物质
- Astronomers know that there's
all sorts of matter out there

564
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:51,208
施加着引力的影响
that exerts a gravitational influence

565
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,597
但我们不能看到它们
but that we can't see.

566
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,416
这些物质被称为“暗物质”
We call that dark matter.

567
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:59,027
如果没有暗物质，那我就不会存在
- I wouldn't exist
if it weren't for dark matter,

568
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:01,499
因为暗物质具有这样的能力
because dark matter
has this nurturing force

569
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:05,149
可以把物质聚集在一起，形成结构
of bringing things together to form structure,

570
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,402
比如形成
to form galaxies,

571
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,874
生命所必需的星系结构
which are absolutely necessary for life.

572
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:13,249
在宇宙里具有明显引力的物质当中
narrator: Dark matter makes up
a staggering 85%

573
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:15,430
暗物质所占的比例惊人
of the gravitationally attractive stuff

574
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:16,930
达到了85%
in the universe.

575
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,041
如果暗物质是某些种类的微粒
- If the dark matter
is some kind of particle,

576
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:22,957
那么通常情况下，每一秒钟穿过我身体的
then typically, millions of dark matter particles

577
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:25,013
暗物质粒子就有数百万
will pass through me
every second.

578
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:29,027
但是，即使知道了暗物质的存在
narrator: But even though
they know dark matter exists,

579
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:33,720
天文学家还是被微观世界的神秘所困惑
astronomers have been confounded
by a microscopic mystery:

580
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,249
它是什么？
what is it?

581
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:39,399
一开始，他们认为这是普通的物质
At first, they thought
it was ordinary matter that,

582
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:42,249
只是由于某种原因看不到它
for some reason, they couldn't see.

583
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,415
进行研究之后
- But what happened was,

584
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,304
天文学家们得出一个结论
astronomers went and took an inventory.

585
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,869
宇宙里有许多的普通物质
We know how much ordinary matter
there is in the universe.

586
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:53,651
所谓的“普通物质”，我们基本上是指原子
By "ordinary matter,"
we basically mean atoms,

587
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:57,443
它们是由质子中子和电子组成
things that are made out of protons, 
neutrons, and electrons,

588
00:29:57,457 --> 00:29:59,582
这些基本微粒
the elementary particles that go into 

589
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,582
组成你、我、地球上的每一样东西
making you, me, everything on Earth.

590
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,083
但这样还不行
And it just doesn't measure up.

591
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,165
构成宇宙的总体
There's not nearly enough
ordinary matter

592
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:09,109
只有普通物质还不够
in the universe to make up the total.

593
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,470
这个结论很怪诞
narrator:
This conclusion was bizarre.

594
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:16,068
微观宇宙的大多数物质怎么可能
How could most of the matter
in the microscopic universe

595
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:20,391
不是由质子、中子和电子构成呢？
not be made of protons, neutrons, and electrons?

596
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:23,651
人们非常惊骇地发现
- It's been quite shocking to discover

597
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,609
这些原子竟然只构成了
that these atoms actually make up

598
00:30:26,637 --> 00:30:30,116
宇宙里的一小部分物体
just a small minority of all
the stuff in the universe.

599
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:32,201
我们看不见的
There's six times more

600
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:33,887
完全不同的物质
of an altogether different substance

601
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:36,373
是看得见的物质的六倍还要多
which is invisible to us.

602
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:39,484
有趣的是，科学家让我们
- It's interesting to think
that science has brought us

603
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:41,012
认识到
to the point where we realize

604
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,459
我们不但不是宇宙的中心
not only are we not
the center of the universe;

605
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:45,708
甚至不是
we're not even made
of the same stuff

606
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,005
由构成大部分宇宙的物质所构成
as the universe is made of, for the most part.

607
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,423
宇宙的绝大多数物质
Most of the stuff in the universe

608
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,386
是暗物质
is this dark matter,

609
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:52,331
它是某些粒子
and it's some small particle

610
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:55,263
存在于我们的直觉之外
beyond the reach
of our direct detection.

611
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,233
一些理论物理学家
narrator:
Some theoretical physicists

612
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:05,164
猜测暗物质可能是由中微子
speculated that dark matter
might be made of neutrinos-

613
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:06,886
这种极小的
tiny particles

614
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:09,386
比电子小一千倍的粒子所构成
a thousand times smaller
than an electron

615
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:13,205
这样就能符合暗物质的许多已知参数
that fit many of the known
characteristics of dark matter.

616
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,150
我们知道中微子的存在
- We know neutrinos exist.

617
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,372
它们有质量
And they have mass.

618
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,827
使重量得到增加
They contribute weight,
so maybe we're done.

619
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,553
但这些不是中微子
But now it's turned out
that they're not neutrinos.

620
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,108
绝大多数的暗物质估计不是正常的中微子
- Most of the dark matter is
probably not normal neutrinos,

621
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,844
因为它们移动得非常、非常快
because they travel
very, very quickly.

622
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,150
会彻底摧毁
And they wipe out the formation

623
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:38,469
宇宙历史早期的
of what's called
large-scale structure,

624
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:42,872
被称为“大尺度结构”的
the clumping of material
on the scale of galaxies,

625
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:45,788
星系里的物质团
early in the universe's history.

626
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,192
如果宇宙里充满着
So it would be much harder
to produce galaxies

627
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:50,733
许多的中微子
if the universe is filled

628
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:53,288
那么就会严重影响到星系的产生
with lots and lots
of neutrinos zooming around.

629
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:58,413
所以暗物质不是普通的物质
- So the dark matter
is not ordinary matter.

630
00:31:58,441 --> 00:31:59,483
它不是中微子
It's not neutrinos.

631
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,533
它是某种全新类型的
It's some wholly new
kind of particle

632
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:02,802
尚未被我们了解的微粒
that we haven't detected yet.

633
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:07,752
它应当是某种奇怪的次原子微粒
- It has to be some sort
of weird subatomic particle

634
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,875
源于宇宙极高温、极高密度时
Ieft over from the big bang,

635
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:11,941
发生的大爆炸
when the universe
was very hot and dense.

636
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:14,717
当时产生了各种各样的微粒
A whole zoo of particles
was created.

637
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:17,842
绝大部分被湮没或合并到其它的微粒中
Most of them annihilated
or decayed into other particles.

638
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,185
但有一些遗留了下来
But some were left over,

639
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,913
那就是我们所说到的暗物质
and they are what are thought
to be the dark matter.

640
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:31,538
这种奇异的微观粒子是怎样的呢？
narrator: But what could this
exotic microscopic particle be?

641
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:35,371
由于科学家对它一无所知
Since it's nothing known to science,

642
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,107
天文学家们认为它是一种全新的粒子
astronomers proposed
an entirely new particle

643
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,607
具有暗物质的所有特性
that embodied all of
dark matter's characteristics

644
00:32:41,774 --> 00:32:44,718
于是，天文学家开始在宇宙里寻觅它的踪迹
and then began
searching the universe for it.

645
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:46,899
并把它称为WIMP
They call it a WIMP,

646
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:50,023
即“大质量弱相互作用粒子”
a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle.

647
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,815
WIMP假说面临着一个问题
- One of the problems
with the WIMP hypothesis

648
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:57,371
能不能在实验室里了解WIMP粒子
is that we've never actually
detected a WIMP in a laboratory.

649
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,829
事实上，有几个实验
- In fact, there's several experiments

650
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:01,801
准备在地下实验室里
going on right this minute

651
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,870
寻找WIMP粒子
to look for WIMPS
in underground laboratories.

652
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:07,579
你可以对它们使用粒子加速器
And you'd also like to make them
in particle accelerators,

653
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,276
比如日内瓦的大型强子对撞机
Iike the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.

654
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:15,079
所以，如果它们就是答案的话
So there's a multipronged attack
to detect WIMPs directly

655
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:17,190
可以有多种方法去了解它们
if they're the right answer.

656
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,279
如果科学家发现了暗物质的证据
narrator: If scientists find
evidence of dark matter,

657
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,787
就相当于找到了另一个世界
will they also find evidence of another world

658
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,634
就会发现暗行星...
of dark planets...

659
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:28,703
暗生物...
dark life-forms...

660
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:32,170
和组成暗物质的元素吗？
and a dark matter
table of elements?

661
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:39,097
我不认为暗物质粒子
- I don't think they are like us,

662
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:41,398
象我们的世界一样
in that the dark matter particles

663
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,434
能够形成行星等等
can form planets and so on,

664
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:45,022
因为，如果它们可以
because if they could,

665
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,647
那么太阳系的绝大多数行星
then we would expect most of the planets
in our solar system

666
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:49,661
实际上就是由暗物质构成
to actually be made of dark matter.

667
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:52,189
我认为更有可能的是
But I think it's much more likely

668
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:55,175
暗域是由许多种不同的粒子复合而成
that the dark sector is many different kinds of particles

669
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:57,383
而不是只由一种粒子构成
that are much more complex
than just one.

670
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,786
然而，现代科学
narrator: However, modern science

671
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:04,494
还没能发现
still has not found evidence

672
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:07,675
这种神秘的微型材料
of this mysterious
microscopic material.

673
00:34:09,244 --> 00:34:11,786
越来越多的科学家坚信
And a growing number of scientists argue

674
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:14,883
这是因为它不是别的东西
that's because it's not something else;

675
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,133
它是别处的东西
it's somewhere else,

676
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,968
来自于另外的世界
Iike other dimensions.

677
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,202
人们非常严肃地认为

678
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,230
暗物质来自于另外的世界
the idea that the dark matter
comes from other dimensions,

679
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:30,550
或者是说明有普通的粒子
or represents ordinary particles

680
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:33,786
跑到另外的世界去了
that are actually moving
in the other dimensions.

681
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:35,897

The thing about other dimensions are,

682
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:36,772
我们看不到
we don't see them,

683
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,898
与它们没有强烈的相互作用
we don't interact with them very strongly,

684
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,276
所以它们自然地隐身起来
so they're a natural place
to put the dark matter.

685
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:46,744
我们把星系和星系团里的

重力的影响
in galaxies and clusters of galaxies

687
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:53,209
归根于我们宇宙中的暗物质
that we attribute to dark matter
in our own universe,

688
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:56,452

690
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:01,035

692
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:05,924
因为它们事实上是其它地方的

很关注这个问题
wanted to...

（询问宇宙）

706
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:47,016
詹森，我向您请教那个问题
- Jason, I'm glad you asked
that question.

707
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,090
宇宙里最小的东西
The smallest things in the universe

708
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,576
是那些基本的次原子粒子

777
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:19,267

“现在我们能看到这个氢原子”
"Can we now see the individual strings

“里面的弦吗？”
inside that hydrogen atom?"

797

答案是“不能”
But the answer is no.

798

假设让这个氢原子继续变大

- We think that ordinary space and time

815
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,571
在普朗克长度上终止
cease to exist at the Planck length.

816
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:01,141
我们不能知道它们的具体情形
What we don't know
is what takes their place.

817
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,779
我们需要透过更基本的事物
We need to replace our idea of space itself

818
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:08,321
各种不同的尺度
by something more fundamental,

819
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,710
或者是完全不同的思想观念
something that might involve
different numbers of dimensions

820
00:41:11,738 --> 00:41:13,946
去改变我们关于空间本身的认识
or just a different concept entirely.

821
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:19,626
有一种可能是，普朗克长度上的空间
narrator: One possibility is
that space at the Planck length

822
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:22,446
类似于足球场上的格子
resembles the grid on a football field.

823
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,043
码线就是我们宇宙的构造
The yard lines are the fabric
of our universe,

824
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:29,973
在其彼此间没有任何东西
and there's simply nothing in between.

825
00:41:31,432 --> 00:41:32,834
时间应当是从一个单独的点
- It could be that time jumps

826
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,940
跳跃到另一个点
from one discrete point to another,

827
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,032
中间没有任何过渡
and there are no steps in between.

828
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:38,834
就象是量子力学上的蚂蚁
- And, like, little quantum mechanical ants

829
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:41,204
从一个孤立的地点挖掘地道
could tunnel from one spot on the grid

830
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,362
去到另一个孤立的地方
to another spot on the grid

831
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,618
而不需要进入
without ever going

832
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,779
两者之间的空间
into the intervening space in between.

833
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:46,570
为什么？
Why?

834
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:49,723
因为两者之间没有空间
'Cause there isn't any
intervening space in between.

835
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:55,627
无论是什么存在于这个极小尺度上
narrator: Whatever exists
at this incredibly small scale,

836
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:59,278
大多数科学家相信，空间和时间的概念
most scientists believe that
the concepts of space and time

837
00:41:59,306 --> 00:42:01,848
延伸到另一个缩小的宇宙里
segue into another kind of universe

838
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:05,653
没有任何意义
where shrinking smaller
is a meaningless concept.

839
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:08,306
应该说，时间和空间
- It could be that time and space

840
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,959
具有我们所说的
are what we call emergent properties

841
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:12,320
“宇宙的突现性”
of the universe,

842
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:16,584
但到了非常小的空间
but that if you go
to very small spatial scales,

843
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:19,195
或者是间隔非常短的时间
or very small intervals of time,

844
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:22,098
时空的概念就被打破了
the concepts of time and space break down.

845
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,514
变得没有意义
They don't make sense.

846
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:29,528
科学家们认为，在普朗克长度下的环境
narrator: Scientists say the
conditions at the Planck length

847
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:32,126
可能非常类似于宇宙大爆炸前的环境
may be very similar to those that existed

848
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,778
在那个时候
before the big bang,

849
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,486
宇宙里的一切
when everything in our universe

850
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,389
很可能集中到一个微小的点上
was probably concentrated
in a microscopic pinpoint.

851
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,347
这与宇宙在最小尺度时
- Maybe the same answers to the question

852
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,875
发生了什么事情
about what happens
to the universe

853
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,736
可能是同一个答案吗？
at the very smallest scales

854
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:50,736
也许这能让我们知道
may also be connected to knowing,

855
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,361
宇宙大爆炸之前的样子
what was the universe like
before the big bang?

856
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,208
它在大爆炸的时候，才开始存在吗？
Did it just come into being
at the big bang,

857
00:42:58,222 --> 00:42:59,639
或者是别的不同的东西
or was there something different

858
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:01,700
在我们知道的大爆炸之后
which then turned into the universe

859
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:03,785
才变成宇宙？
that we're familiar with
at the big bang?

860
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,748
一切我们不能回答的问题
These are all questions
we don't know the answer to

861
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,992
全都与普朗克长度上的情况
but are all connected to the issue

862
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:10,958
有着紧密的联系
of what's going on at the Planck scale.

863
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:14,680
你可能会想，微小的普朗克长度上的东西
- You might think that these tiny Planck-scale things

864
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,013
与我们这些庞然大物无关
have nothing to do with us,
who are much bigger.

865
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:19,833
但事实上，它在一切事情上影响着我们
But actually, it has everything to do with us.

866
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:21,971
它是我们的起源
It's our origins.

867
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:25,499
我们整个宇宙，如果往前推算
Our entire universe,
if we extrapolate backwards,

868
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:27,485
曾经比普朗克长度还小
would have been smaller
than the Planck length.

869
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,557
无论在最小的次原子世界里
narrator: Whatever exists at the smallest scales

870
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,055
存在着什么东西
of the subatomic world,

871
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:36,318
也不管它们的情况如何
and however these things behave,

872
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,971
科学家们认为，他们必须全部了解它们
scientists say
they must make sense of it all

873
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:42,916
才有可能去了解整个宇宙
before they can possibly
comprehend the cosmos above,

874
00:43:43,402 --> 00:43:44,818
人类行为
human behavior,

875
00:43:46,193 --> 00:43:49,596
以及大爆炸之前可能存在的东西
and what might have existed
before the big bang.

876
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:53,245
这就是研究微观宇宙里
It's a mind-boggling amount of information

877
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,794
难以想象的小空间
tucked inside an unimaginably small space

878
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,929
的宏伟意义
of our microscopic universe.
