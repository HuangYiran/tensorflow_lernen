{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, are you kidding me? Sundays?

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole family's together.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all watching the game.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was negative. You didn't even

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just didn't appreciate it or you before.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Time to go.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost all that. I blew it.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you also blew it. We can get it back.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm better now and I hope you are, too.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna appreciate...

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be there in a minute, okay?

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be there in a minute.

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's true love.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's when I had long hair.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People say I talk about my hair too much.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far.

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cut this side back too far

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that.

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said, just cut it the way you cut it...

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once you get in the right frame of mind,

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think anything's possible.

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we get, we so often

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get caught in this state of negativity and

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Technically,

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can take him out against our recommendation,

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court.

35
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's just getting used to the routine here.

36
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want him to get used to the routine here.

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight months is already long enough.

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?

40
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I don't understand.

41
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess everybody's leaving today!

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat told me all about you,

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how God made you rich in character,

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're the mighty oak that holds

47
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the household together,

48
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the Birds play.

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad combination.

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.

53
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was when I was an X-ray technician

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}medication and I took advantage of it.

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's when my hair was long, too.

57
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my hair only grew when I was older.

58
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause when I was younger,

59
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my hair didn't grow because my brother...

60
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember I told you about my brother,

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because my hair didn't grow long enough.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was so jealous of my brother...

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But Wait a minute, Wait a minute.  - Hello?

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! It looks great now.  - You like it?

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, It's good now.  - Yes, it is.

67
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, you're going the wrong way!

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away.

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.

71
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just talk about this.

72
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom, just listen.  - Don't tou...ch

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the steering...wheel!

74
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.

75
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?

76
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my fault. Pat didn't know.

78
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat didn't know. He's my friend,

79
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he was rootin' for me.

80
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital,

81
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital,

82
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see,

83
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's fine. It's my fault.

84
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, can we stop at the library?

85
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.

86
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.

87
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DeSean Jackson.

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to DeSean Jackson?

89
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, tell me that one.

90
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's insanity. He spikes the ball

91
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at the one yard line. The one fucking-yard line.

92
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.

93
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He celebreated before it was even in.

94
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know something? It's nothing new.

95
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your team does that all the time.

96
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They get close... and then they blow it.

97
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got an inferiority complex.

98
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

99
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What makes the Cowboys America's Team?

100
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we are, we're America's Team.

101
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be ashamed of yourself. We're in Philadelphia,

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor.

103
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's more American than a cowboy?

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what's more American? What?

105
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.

106
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Benjamin Franklin?

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Benjamin Franklin.

108
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The founder of our country, here in Philadelphia.

109
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean the guy with the...

110
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...little glasses and the long scraggly hair?

111
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the lightning with the kite?

112
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He stood in the storm with a kite.

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill,

114
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody would even know who he is.

115
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? No, no,

116
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no, no. Don't touch them, don't touch them.

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't even touch them. Why are you..., don't blame me.

118
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who did this? Who took, who took, who took the...

119
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the remotes like this? Did you do this, Randy?

120
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact,

121
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why you need so many.

122
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she is! Look how beautiful!

123
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?! What's this?

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything good?

125
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where is it?  - It's right here.

126
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it. We got that.

127
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want them to steal that.

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You still got yours?  - Yeah, I got mine.

129
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what, you don't talk to me?

130
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't tell me you took him out.

131
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's ready. Look at him.

132
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?

133
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't worry about that.  - I wanna make sure when you come out

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're okay, and she didn't say anything.

135
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You didn't tell me?  - The court said yes. Don't worry.

136
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but what did the doctor say?

137
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the, the court listens to the doctor.

138
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and the court said...

139
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The court listens to the doctor, the doctor...

140
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.

141
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

142
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I'm in there because of the court.

143
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the agreement that we made months ago.

144
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a plea bargain with the courts.

145
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lawyer, he instructed me,

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he said that what we should plead that, and

147
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.

148
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all under control.

149
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay. Congratulations.

150
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?

151
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.

152
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.

153
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you gonna pay for it?

154
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it.

155
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From your bookmaking?

156
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who told you that?  - Mom told me. Outside.

157
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not. No, I didn't.

158
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about?

159
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs,

160
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you said, don't say anything,

161
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking.

162
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him?

163
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has the wrong idea.

164
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's fine, Patrick.

165
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm more concerned about you than anything else.

166
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, Dad. Good.

167
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, the question, the big question,

168
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is what are you gonna do with yourself?

169
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I gonna do? I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim,

170
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting really fit for Nikki.

171
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus

172
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and get my old job back.

173
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki sold the house. She left.

174
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't your mother tell you that?

175
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you something.

176
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?

177
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right? Our marriage...

178
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're very, very much in love,

179
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}okay? Just like you two.

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Patrick, she's gone.

181
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not around anymore. Nikki left.

182
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing, Dad? You know...

183
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excelsior. Excelsior.  - What does that mean?

184
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this

185
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining,

186
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit.

187
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.

188
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?!

189
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stupid fucking book!

190
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids.

191
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean the whole time, let me just break it down for you

192
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the whole time you're

193
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war

194
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...

195
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting

197
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine.

198
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful?

199
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're gonna be happy, and they're

201
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}gonna be drinking wine and they dance

202
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they both like to dance with each other,

203
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring,

204
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I liked it, because they were happy.

205
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending.

206
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard

207
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is.

208
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't somebody say, let's be positive?

209
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's have a good ending to the story?

210
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, you owe us an apology.

211
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, for what, I can't apologize.

212
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna apologize for this.

213
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of

214
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.

215
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.

216
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you run with me?

217
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was reading.

218
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while.

219
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you wearing a garbage bag for?  - I'm gonna go run now.

220
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window.

221
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll fix it when I get back.  - Fix it now.

222
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna go to therapy.

224
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to go. It's part of the deal.

225
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't live with us and not go.

226
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that song really playing?

227
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have music sometimes.

228
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?

229
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

230
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean, you can't?

231
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I...

232
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this?

233
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there a speaker here?

234
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is, is the speaker here?

235
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay... I'm sorry.

236
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll fix all this, okay?

237
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. Alright!

238
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's...

239
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can call me Cliff, please.

240
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Cliff, that's not

241
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the way you're supposed to meet people, okay?

242
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should write that down in your, I don't know

243
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your little book you write stuff down in.

244
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about that song. I just

245
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.

246
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo. It's a trigger.

247
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna take any meds,

248
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should just tell you that right now.

249
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, You have to take medicine.

250
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy...

251
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you will have to take medication.

252
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want any meds, Doctor.

253
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I am not the explosion guy,okay?

254
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy.

255
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got kicked out of that stadium he beat

256
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.

257
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I had one incident.  - One incident can change a lifetime.

258
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm ready.

259
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street.

260
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just needs to take responsibility for hers.

261
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's hers?

262
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's hers? Are you joking?

263
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go back to the incident.

264
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come home from work after I..

265
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}left early, which I never do by the way,

266
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}fight with Nancy, the high school ...principal.

267
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding.

268
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us.

269
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd,

270
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause I should have.

271
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come home, what do I see?

272
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I walk in the door and I see underwear and

273
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it,

274
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I walk up the stairs, and all...

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...all of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the DVD

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song,

277
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then I look down and I see my wife's...

278
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...panties on the ground and then

279
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I look up and I see her naked in the shower

280
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I think,that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower.

281
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a perfect thing.

282
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there.

283
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never fuck in the shower anymore.

284
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe today we will.

285
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...

286
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...teacher with tenure.

287
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know what he says to me?

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You should probably go.  - That's what he says to me.

289
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So yeah, I snapped.

290
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking

291
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.

292
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Can you talk

293
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about something that you did, before or after?

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told them that my wife and the history guy

296
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were plotting against me

297
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by embezzling money from the local high school, which

298
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wasn't true... It was a delusion.

299
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we later found out from the hospital

300
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's because I'm,

301
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...undiagnosed bipolar.

302
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking

303
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}brought on by severe stress,

304
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which rarely happens, thank God.

305
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the shower incident happened

306
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that's when everything snapped,

307
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I then realized that, I've been dealing with

308
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this my whole life.

309
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And without any supervision I've been doing it all

310
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on my own with no help

311
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.

312
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That had to be hard.

313
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's a lot to deal with,

314
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}especially when you don't know what the hell is happening,

315
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I do now. Sort of.

316
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, you have to take your medication.

317
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't, Mom. I can't.

318
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will call them. They'll come for you.

319
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that.

320
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you call them?

321
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up?

322
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them,

323
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom. I don't feel good.

324
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated.

325
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like the way it makes me look.

326
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just take your medication?

327
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've gotta take your medication.

328
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out,

329
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's what I'm doin'.

330
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is he wearing a garbage bag?

331
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you wearing a garbage bag?

332
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To sweat.

333
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down. We're seven minutes in,

334
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no score. Come on, help turn the juju around.

335
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe in juju, Dad.

336
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Mister Excelsior.

337
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna be positive? Be positive. Sit down.

338
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right, all right.  - Come on.

339
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.

340
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says you're good luck, honey.

341
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that in your hand?

342
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a... see?

343
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Handkerchief?  - Yeah.

344
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's OCD. That's crazy.

345
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What OCD?

346
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want my son to watch the game with me, so sue me.

347
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just sit down, come on. I want you to watch the game with me.

348
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not superstitious. That's a small thing that I do.

349
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I make a lot of money,

350
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what's the difference if I do this or that?

351
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.

352
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.

353
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see?! You see that?! You're meant to be here!

354
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is special. Everything happens for a reason.

355
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you came home. Embrace it! Embrace it!

356
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the reason? I don't think so.

357
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet.

358
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom.  - Yeah. No, no... ...I'm just confirming.

359
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just confirming. Okay.

360
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait, wait.

361
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I do.. an interview

362
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- for a school project on mental illness?  - No.

363
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's for a school project!  - Don't pay any attention.

364
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it? That's him.

365
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he the guy who's having the problem?

366
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People are stupid. They, they,

367
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- they, they don't know what they're saying.  - Yeah, that's the one.

368
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let them hurt your feelings.

369
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pat, don't look for Nikki!  - Take your camera and get out of here!

370
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Patrick, please.  - Pat!

371
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Patty!  - Don't look for Nikki!

372
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ms. Meckers!

373
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God! Oh, God!

374
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nance! This is my lucky day!

375
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you working on a Sunday!

376
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you?

377
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

378
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just came by to say hi,

379
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.

380
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't be here.

381
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll work full-time, half-time.

382
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll work sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.

383
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.

384
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I got it. I got it. I got it.  - Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something.

385
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does Nikki still work here?

386
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I can't tell you that.

387
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Doug Culpepper is still here.

388
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you tell me that?

389
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know he broke up my marriage.

390
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, are you being, a troublemaker?

391
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?

392
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.

393
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get away from me! Get away!

394
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay?

395
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good.

396
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.

397
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?

398
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just have to give it some time.

399
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

400
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, a lot went down. People will get over it.

401
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be all good. It'll work out.

402
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! It will be!

403
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy!

404
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A silver development! That's a silver lining!

405
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck.

406
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ronnie! Pat.

407
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is! He's back!

408
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Welcome home.  - Thank you.

409
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back, man.

410
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm out.

411
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? You're out out?

412
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool, man. You lost a lot of weight.

413
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I almost didn't recognize you.

414
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

415
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I didn't visit

416
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you in the hospital. You know, work's out of

417
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back.

418
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I missed you. I really need someone to talk to.

419
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta come see the baby.

420
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.

421
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.

422
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?

423
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know Veronica still hates me.  - That's not true.

424
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it is. Nikki always said that

425
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar

426
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where she keeps his balls, in her purse.

427
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not true.  - Ronnie! What are you doing?

428
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you,

429
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're wrong because

430
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why would she tell me to invite you to dinner?

431
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you invite him?

432
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

433
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can he make it?

434
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know yet!

435
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you make it next Sunday?

436
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

437
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you next Sunday.

438
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right?

439
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?

440
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

441
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in here, please. I need you.

442
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

443
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As soon as you left, the Redskins

444
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.

445
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging it,

446
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}loses the challenge, loses the game.

447
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do.

448
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we should spend time together anyway.

449
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.

450
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.

451
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that? What's the good news?

452
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things are looking up.

453
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, are they?

454
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, she might be with that guy.

456
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, the...

457
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no way! No way. Dad, no way

458
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She, no, she might be with him. She's afraid of you.

459
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She doesn't want to talk to you.

460
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?

461
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the phone down. You gotta...

462
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait just a minute.

463
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the phone down, please.

464
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

465
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, stop.

466
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.

467
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Give me the phone. Give me the phone.  - Pat!

468
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta understand me. You wanna go back?

469
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well then, stop this! Then don't fucking do this.

470
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to me like that.

471
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well then, don't behave this way.

472
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a call asking to check on this house.

473
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat Solatano?

474
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

475
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.

476
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order.

477
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I heard you went to your old house and the school.

478
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case,

479
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor.

480
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Respect the restraining order, okay?

481
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Five hundred feet.  - You hear what he just said?

482
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a restraining order.

483
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Dad, I know.

484
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Officer.

485
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you need anything... my card.

486
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Sorry. We understand.

487
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since when do cops have cards?

488
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me one thing.

489
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail

490
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or to the hospital?

491
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So take your medication and if you do fine,

492
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll reduce them.

493
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order,

494
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then she's gonna be with me.

495
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's better than any medication.

496
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it,

497
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that she may not return.

498
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns.

499
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the meantime, if you listen to that song,

500
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you to fall apart.

501
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So get a strategy, okay? You need one.

502
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me say something, I gotta say something.

503
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

504
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what I believe to be true.

505
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what I learned in the hospital.

506
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest,

507
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if you do, if you stay positive,

508
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have a shot at a silver lining.

509
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Work on a strategy, okay?

510
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night

511
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's like a real hoity-toity thing

512
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and his wife veronica's a real stickler for...

513
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear,

514
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I wanna wear a jersey

515
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.

516
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which jersey?

517
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DeSean Jackson.

518
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DeSean Jackson is the man.

519
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that settles that.

520
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat! What are you doin'?

521
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go, man.

522
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

523
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake,

524
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have worn this.

525
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey.

526
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I was wearing that jersey.

527
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you comfortable?

528
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Veronica's not gonna like it.

529

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get over here.

530
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,860

531
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor.

532
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You come however you wanna come.

533
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

536
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean rookie of the year?

537
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

538
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,150

539
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

540
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't it awesome?

541
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not for dinner.

542
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, he got us flowers.

543
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

544
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And wine.

545
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.

546
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tremendous.

547
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't it great?

548
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tremendous.

549
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again.  - Why?

550
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Because.  - Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.

551
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain.

552
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't the market down, though?

553
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is down, but you know, she wants more,

554
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm giving her more, man.

555
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.

556
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, man.

557
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A lot of people. My uncle, too.  - Really?

558
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect,

559
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's not personal, but this is the time to strike.

560
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You start snapping up commercial real estate, cheap

561
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}flip it over, you flip it over and

562
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's when you make the money.

563
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the pressure... it's like...

564
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay?

565
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me.

566
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I'm getting crushed and...

567
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crushed by what?

568
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything. The family, the baby,

569
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the job, the fucking dicks at work,

570
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's like, you know,

571
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like I'm trying to do this, you know, and,

572
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, and I'm like... suffocating.

573
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

574
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't be happy all the time.

575
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who told you you can't be happy?

576
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.

577
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not true at all.  - You just can't.

578
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

579
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over.

580
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You okay with that?  - Who?

581
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Veronica's sister.

582
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany. Tiffany and Tommy?

583
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Just Tiffany.

584
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to Tommy?

585
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died.

586
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tommy died?  - Cops die.

587
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd he die?

588
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, don't bring it up.

589
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, how did he die?

590
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did who die?

591
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany! This is Pat.

592
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,940

595
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not flirting with you.

596
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I didn't think you were.

597
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just see that you made an effort

598

599
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty.

600
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never used to do that. I do that now.

601
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause we're gonna be better than ever... Nikki. Just practicing.

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd Tommy die?

603
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about your job?

604
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just got fired, actually.

605
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? How?

606
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?

607
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it really matter?

608
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby, how's it going?

609
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great, great.

610
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna go on a tour now.

611
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go see the house.

612
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's go for the tour.

613
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've, I've been planning this forever. I love our house.

614
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love our house. I'm really excited about it.

615
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

616
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess what it is.

617
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, it's a television.  - Nope.

618
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a computer screen.

619
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just keep going, keep going, keep going.

620
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.

621
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a light. It's a...

622
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warmer, warmer, warmer.

623
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies

624
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and shoot them with formaldehyde.

625
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where would the body go, though?

626
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a joke!

627
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a fireplace.

628
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the middle of the wall?

629
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a port in every room. Give me an iPod.

630
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who, who doesn't have an iPod?

631
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone.

632
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They won't let me make any calls.

633
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They think I'm gonna call Nikki.

634
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.

635
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would call Nikki.

636
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one.

637
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me your iPod.

638
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.

639
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in,

640
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.

641
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can play music for the baby in any room.

642
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you play Ride the Lightning? By Metallica?

643
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany.

644
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.

645
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's a fun fact. You know where the term OK comes from?

646
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, I don't.

647
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where?

648
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Martin Van Buren,

649
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the eighth president of the United States of America,

650
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is from Kinderhook, New York

651
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he was part of a club,

652
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a men's club, called Old Kinderhook.

653
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you were cool, you were in the club,

654
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they'd say, that guy's OK.

655
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.

656
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really?  - Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

657
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's interesting.

658
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years

659
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she's real good at it.

660
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.

661
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.

662
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you have to talk about me like that?

663
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister?

664
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk about me in the third person.

665
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, give me a break.

666
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm right here.

667
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just be nice. Just be nice.

668
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fascinating.

669
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

670
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I know, I know.

671
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What meds are you on?

672
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? None.

673
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify,

674
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I don't take them anymore, no.

675
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.

676
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,

677
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped.

678
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever take Klonopin?

679
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Klonopin? Yeah.

680
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right?  - Jesus.

681
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like, what? What day is it?

682
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about Trazodone?

683
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trazodone!

684
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done.

685
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes the light right out of your eyes.

686
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, I bet it does.

687
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm tired. I wanna go.

688
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, no, no, no. We haven't,

689
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we haven't even finished the salad yet or the duck.

690
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made the Fire and Ice cake.

691
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said I'm tired. Are you gonna walk me home or what?

692
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean me?

693
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?

694
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have poor social skills. You have a problem.

695
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a problem?

696
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things.

697
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You scare people.

698
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell the truth. But you're mean.

699
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I'm not telling the truth?

700
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?

701
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can drive them both home. Now.

702
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop talking about me in third person.

703
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can take Tiffany home first.

704
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love it when I have problems.

705
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love it, Von,

706
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because then you can be the good one. Just say it.

707
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No... I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice,

708
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to have a nice dinner. Oh, God.

709
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is your problem?!

710
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go.

711
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, are you ready?

712
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really, you really wanna go right now?

713
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.

714
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

715
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.

716
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, man.

717
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage

718
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I don't really remember how this works.

719
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How what works?

720
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.

721
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.

722
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not liars like they are.

723
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I live in the addition around back,

724
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is completely separate from my parents' house,

725
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so there's no chance of them walking in on us.

726
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner

727
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I hate football,

728
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?

729
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How old are you?

730
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old enough to have a marriage end

731
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and not wind up in a mental hospital.

732
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I had a really good time tonight

733
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?

734
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're married? So am I.

735
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's confusing. He's dead.

736
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, what?

737
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

738
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

739
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay? Ronnie called.

740
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?

741
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, Mom.

742
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened over there?

743
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When am I gonna get a phone?

744
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll get a phone in due time.

745
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

746
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat!

747
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom!

748
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up.

749
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

750
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my wedding video?

751
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's after three o'clock! What are you doing?

752
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I looked in here, but this is all your shit up here,

753
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?

754
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about in your father's study?

755
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go in my study.

756
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, not now!

757
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you put it in here?

758
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It makes no sense for you to put it in here.

759
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patty, what are you doing?

760
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!

761
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it here?

762
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patty!

763
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's probably in the attic.

764
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going in my study?

765
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.

766
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please stop yelling!

767
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated

768
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I should have my fucking wedding video!

769
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat! Pat!

770
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I looked over there! I already looked all over there!

771
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down, Pat.

772
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears,

773
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up!

774
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it!

775
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I don't care!

776
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat! Stop it!

777
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

778
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

779
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want it!

780
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!

781
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

782
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't watch my wedding video, but I can hear the fucking song

783
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

784
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck you doing?! You hit your mother?!

785
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no, no!

786
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it!

787
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off me, Dad!

788
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop hitting him!

789
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop hitting him!

790
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!

791
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

792
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police! Open up.

793
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls.

794
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People in the neighborhood are scared. I gotta come in.

795
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we doing in here?

796
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are a lot of reports from your neighbors,

797
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we got a lot of phone calls.

798
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki is being manipulated and controlled.

799
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to talk to her.

800
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, sit down.

801
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down.

802
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta stop with these crazy theories.

803
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a cop. What are you doing?

804
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a medication problem, but he's fine now.

805
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,710

882
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I hate my illness and I want to control it.

883
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father, on the other hand,

884
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night,

885
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I did not return

886
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause I could've killed him and I didn't.

887
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's sixty-five years old.

888
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean...

889
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was scared for your mother

890
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you hurt him as well.

891
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?

892
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I think he probably just tried to do his best.

893
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, you have to have a strategy.

894
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you earlier.

895
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to recognize these feelings coming to you,

896
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,570

897
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when you get these feelings,

898
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you need to get to a quieter place,

899
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and be at peace with yourself, however you can.

900
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but that's easier said than done.

901
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.

902

903

904
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

905
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

906
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you have a restraining order.

907
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What good are you, man?

908
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you have this overwhelming urgency

909
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to see your wedding video last night?

910
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I don't know, because I'm married

911
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?

912
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you think that Nikki's not around

913
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Tiffany's an attractive girl

914
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if you get drawn towards Tiffany,

915
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?

916
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad, Doctor Jones.

917
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki

918
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because Tiffany's a slut.

919
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is she a slut?

920
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After the dinner at Ronnie's,

921
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she said, quote, "We can go to the back house

922
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out."

923
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring.

924
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

925
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe she just needs a friend

926
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she thought if she offers you sex,

927
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it will be easier for you to become friends with her.

928
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said she's not a whore anymore,

929
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but she likes that part of herself

930
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}along with all the other parts of herself

931
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and can I say the same?

932
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you?

933
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that...? You're asking that,

934
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're really asking me that question?

935
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

936
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?

937
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.

938
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just giving back your words to you.

939
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This "Crazy sad shit," as you call it,

940
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}made you a happier, calmer person

941
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a beautiful positive philosophy of

942
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}going outdoors, working out, and reading books.

943
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not the books.

944
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany.

945
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you become friends with Tiffany,

946
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki will think that

947
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person,

948
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who helps people in need,

949
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who is basically thriving.

950
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.

951
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know when I run?

952
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to clarify something.

953
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want us to be friends.

954
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear what I said?

955
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you giving me such a hard time?

956
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

957
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.

958
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna have dinner at this diner?

959
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pick me up at seven thirty.

960
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy Halloween.

961
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go.

962
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

963
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.

964
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great!

965
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tea.

966
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be right back.

967
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look nice.

968
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

969
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raisin Bran. Milk.

970
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

971
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to share this?

972
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you order Raisin Bran?

973
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you order tea?

974
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

975
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ordered Raisin Bran

976
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.

977
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can still be a date

978
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you order Raisin Bran.

979
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a date.

980
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how's your thing going, your dancing thing?

981
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good. How's your restraining order?

982
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing",

983
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well.

984
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.

985
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the so-called incident with the weights.

986
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. That was a thing with my parents.

987
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki

988
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it was minor

989
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I could just explain it and let her know

990
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I'm actually not out of control

991
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that I'm actually doing really well.

992
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can get a letter to Nikki.

993
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see her sometimes with my sister.

994
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would be so amazing

995
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.

996
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have to hide it from Veronica.

997
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not into breaking the law,

998
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which this letter would definitely be doing.

999
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you would do it?

1000
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family,

1001
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you should hear how I lost my job.

1002
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you lose your job?

1003
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By...

1004
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}having sex with everybody in the office.

1005
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody?

1006
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was very depressed after Tommy died.

1007
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a lot of people.

1008
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have to talk about it.

1009
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

1010
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many were there?

1011
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eleven.

1012
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow.  - I know.

1013
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.  - Okay.

1014
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I ask you one more question?

1015
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Were there any women?  - Yes.

1016
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really?  - Yes.

1017
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was that like?  - Hot.

1018
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

1019
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it like... older women,

1020
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you...

1021
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.

1022
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You sat on her lap?

1023
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm-hmm.

1024
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She told you what to do?  - Mm-hmm.

1025
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh... my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this.

1026
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Made me feel like such a pervert.

1027
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Maybe we should change the subject.  - I don't mind it.

1028
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't, do you?

1029
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1030
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then people were getting into fights

1031
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...

1032
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the boss called me in to his office and

1033
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tried to pin it all on me.

1034
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I accused him of harassment

1035
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then they fired me, sent me home

1036
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and put me on some meds.

1037
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...

1038
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was in the shower with the history teacher...

1039
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard about that.

1040
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my wedding song

1041
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy.

1042
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.

1043
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

1044
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. So they put me on medication,

1045
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I feel ashamed of.

1046
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah.  - So I know.

1047
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do.

1048
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I just gotta get a strategy, you know?  - Me too.

1049
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd better get back to the letter.

1050
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

1051
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?

1052
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.

1053
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.

1054
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I at least finish my tea?

1055
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, what?

1056
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My tea. Can I finish it?

1057
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?

1058
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would she do that? Was it a test?

1059
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

1060
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do?

1061
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I did pretty well.

1062
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.

1063
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Basically? Was I some percentage not cool?

1064
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she said you were cool, but you know.

1065
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't know.

1066
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.

1067
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?

1068
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sort of like me.

1069
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.

1070
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why?  - Because, it's just not right,

1071
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lumping you and I together,

1072
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's just wrong.

1073
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Nikki wouldn't like that.

1074
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially after all the shit you just told me.

1075
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think that I'm crazier than you.

1076
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because...

1077
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well, we're different, I mean...

1078
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

1079
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh. You're killing me.

1080
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? Forget I offered to help you.

1081
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget the entire fucking idea.

1082
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cause that must have been fucking crazy

1083
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I am so much crazier than you.

1084
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your voice down.

1085
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!

1086
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it!

1087
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shut the fuck up.  - Fuck you!

1088
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shut the fuck up!

1089
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!

1090
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow down, Raisin Bran.

1091
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?

1092
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, you do.  - No, I don't.

1093
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told your therapist

1094
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?

1095
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Hey, calm down! Hey...

1096
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just leave me alone!

1097
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I just explain myself, please?

1098
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't want Nikki to think that

1099
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior

1100
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I've never done anything like that, okay?

1101
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may not have experienced the shit that I did.

1102
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you loved hearing about it, didn't you?

1103
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are afraid to be alive,

1104
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.

1105
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a conformist. You're a liar.

1106
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I opened up to you and you judged me.

1107
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are an asshole. You are an asshole!

1108
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,140

00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids?

1123
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do?

1124
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...

1135
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gonna go your whole life scared of that song?

1136
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a song. Don't make it a monster.

1137
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on breath! There's no song. There's no song.

1138
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no song playing.

1139
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.

1140
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. There you go.

1141
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  - I'm sorry.

1142
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took it too far.

1143
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:15,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, is he messing with you?

1144
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. No, this was just a joke.

1145
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a joke I started.

1146
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a restraining order on this guy.

1147
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.

1148
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not a good thing to do.

1149
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.

1150
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're Tommy's widow, right?

1151
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,

1152
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}minus the whore thing for the most part.

1153
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime?

1154
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What'd I say?  - She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.

1155
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.

1156
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I know you didn't mean it.

1157
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't mean it at all.

1158
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, you say shit

1159
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't mean all the time.

1160
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the time.

1161
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry.

1162
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.

1163
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you do.

1164
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:14,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You do?  - Yeah, sure.

1165
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?

1166
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing.

1167
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope

1168
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and one of them took it.

1169
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's the only answer.  - No, no, no.

1170
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dolores, somebody was in my study.

1171
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who took one of my envelopes?

1172
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody took an envelope.

1173
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should call the FBI.

1174
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make fun. This is serious.

1175
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,770

1177
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna just explain to you something.

1178
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey.

1179
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This everything, like this.

1180
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this, it all corresponds.

1181
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a problem.

1182
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta ask.

1183
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not go in my study

1184
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or I will eat you!?

1185
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not funny, it's not funny.

1186
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's everybody making a joke out of this for?

1187
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dolores, you are so beautiful!

1188
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!

1189
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, a lot of envelopes go in

1190
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in.

1191
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So show some respect for what I do.

1198
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't want to wake me? He didn't want to wake me.

00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's very happy.  - I'm happy.

1208
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're so up, up, up, up.

1209
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that a good thing?

1210
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just up, up, up. I don't know what that is.

1211
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?

1212
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am.

1213
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Taking a little bit too many or something?

1214
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, if I was taking that,

1215
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be on the floor, Dad.

1216
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stay with us. Stay for the game.

1217
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Spend some family time.  - Dad, I can't. Look,

1218
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ready to go. What do you mean?

1219
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spend family time.

1220
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?

1221
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out.

1222
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on.  - I can't.

1223
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the Seahawks. Put on the jersey and stay,

1224
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}please. Please. It's important, please.

1225
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you up to, Pat?  - Nothing, come on.

1226
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's in the envelope?

1227
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what are you doing? What's in that envelope?

1228
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, I'm beating the song!

1229
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on the scoreboard!

1230
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm playing down field! I feel great!

1231
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:30,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany.

1232
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?

1233
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want with her?

1234
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.

1235
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.

1236
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great, a married creep.

1237
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm her friend. We go running.

1238
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you guys not seen us?

1239
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took her to the diner.

1240
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not here.

1241
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home?

1242
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go away.

1243
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know her.

1244
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know her, we've dated.  - What are you doing here?

1245
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We still date.

1246
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've called her, I've texted her.

1247
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know this guy?  - I still haven't heard back.

1248
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We used to work together...  - Just get the hell out of here.

1249
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.

1250
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Another rude creep.  - Listen to what he's saying.

1251
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Listen to what he's saying.  - What's he saying?

1252
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's saying you're being rude.  - How am I being rude?

1253
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you know. You know. Come on.

1254
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes it's okay with girls like this,

1255
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they wanna have fun

1256
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and sometimes it's not

1257
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt,

1258
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they're an easy target.

1259
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And in this case, in this particular case,

1260
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that wing is being fixed, my friend.

1261
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you gotta make sure it gets mended.

1262
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay?

1263
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because she's sensitive and she's smart,

1264
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she's artistic. This is a great girl

1265
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on.

1266
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me walk you down to your car.

1267
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a better guy than this.

1268
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can see it in your eyes.  - She just texted me!

1269
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened?

1270
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?

1271
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't, I can't do it.

1272
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?

1273
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't give the letter to Nikki.

1274
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany, what are you talking about?

1275
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?

1276
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because what am I getting in return?

1277
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing for me?

1278
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said! You said if I wrote a letter,

1279
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- you'd get it to Nikki.  - I know.

1280
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was the set-up.

1281
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I do this time after time after time,

1282
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and,

1283
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm empty, I have nothing!

1284
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

1285
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You seem like you're a tough girl to me.

1286
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just do things on your own?

1287
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always get myself in these fucking situations.

1288
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give everything to other people and nobody ever...

1289
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never... I don't get what I want, okay?

1290
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not my sister.

1291
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?

1292
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can't do it.  - Tiffany, what do you want me to do?

1293
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Think of something.  - There's this thing.

1294
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?

1295
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.

1296
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a dance thing, all right.

1297
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.

1298
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tommy would never do it with me  - Well, Tommy's dead

1299
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- so he's not gonna fucking do it.  - And I missed it every single year.

1300
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you please!  - I don't have a filter when I talk.

1301
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we have one conversation without you reminding me

1302
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that my goddamn husband is dead?

1303
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

1304
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God!

1305
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can only do it if I have a partner...

1306
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now I'm about to miss it for another year.

1307
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you.

1308
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

1309
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, your big schedule is so busy?

1310
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grapes of Wrath?

1311
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And watching football with your dad?

1312
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.

1313
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.

1314
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.

1315
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about it.

1316
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I already did do something for you, you know.

1317
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you do for me?

1318
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.

1319
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Jordie?

1320
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?

1321
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.

1322
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?

1323
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about?

1324
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in love and we're married.

1325
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's completely different.

1326
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you in love?

1327
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me about that. The big Nikki love.

1328
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.

1329
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a very unconventional chemistry,

1330
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it makes people feel awkward, but not me.

1331
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.

1332
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow.  - It's electric between us,

1333
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other,

1334
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that's normal, couples wanna do that,

1335
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want her to stop dressing like she dresses,

1336
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay?

1337
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings,

1338
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of which both I've done.

1339
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, people fight. Couples fight.

1340
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks.

1341
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's normal. She always wanted the best for me.

1342
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate.

1343
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's a good thing, you knwo?

1344
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good thing. You know?

1345
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just, look, I'm my best self today,

1346
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I think she's her best self today,

1347
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.

1348
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be amazing,

1349
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing,

1350
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take

1351
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}advantage of a situation without offering to do something back.

1352
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So think about the dance thing.

1353
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danny, you're out of the hospital?

1354
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're here on game day?

1355
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm out. It's official, man. They didn't convert me to

1356
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my Mental Hygiene Law admission status

1357
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence,

1358
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm out. They had to let me go.

1359
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never understand what he's saying.

1360
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,

1361

1363
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He calls me kailhouse Lawyer?

1364
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold the remote the way you were holding it before.

1365
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now you're holding the remote?

1366
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,740

1377
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful.

1378

1383
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:49,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You judge everybody.

1384

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maria, I just met a girl named Maria...

1404
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:28,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days,

1405
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I go to the Garage... Metallica... Megadeth.

1406
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I start fucking smashing shit.

1407
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta get your marriage together.

1408
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And I...

1409
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ronnie, that's fucked up.

1410
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but it makes me feel better.

1411
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like my therapy, you know?

1412
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I'm with Nikki,

1413
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm never gonna do stuff like that...

1414
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki?

1415
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro.

1416
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit, look at you! You are fit!

1417
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?

1418
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How you doing, Jake?  - Good.

1419
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.

1420
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?

1421
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, listen, I'm sorry that

1422
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't come see you down at the hospital.

1423
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how those places creep me out,

1424
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the firm's been expanding.

1425
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been helping Papa with the restaurant

1426
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because he needs to have a legitimate business.

1427
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He needs a tax return.

1428
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking,

1429
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:26,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're gonna come after him.

1430
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then it looks like I'm making,

1431
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna make partner at the firm.

1432
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore.

1433
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:34,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lost your wife,

1434
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting engaged,

1435
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things.

1436
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lost your house,

1437
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting a new house.

1438
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm.

1439
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe stop talking about all the stuff

1440
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's good for you and bad for him.

1441
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just, you know, leave it alone. We're watching the game.

1442
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what, I'm just gonna,

1443
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking.

1444
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:59,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna shut my mouth.

1445
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As my friend Danny would say

1446
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got nothing but love for you, brother.

1447
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. That's right. That's nice. That's nice.

1448
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank God, finally.

1449
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- DeSean Jackson.  - Yeah. Did it fit?

1450
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.

1451
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.

1452
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Veronica didn't like it.

1453
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Veronica hates the jersey.

1454
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?

1455
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.

1456
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, you're up to something, I know.

1457
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me,

1458
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay?

1459
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you ever think about that?

1460
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we understand something because we're more...

1461
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it.

1462
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:52,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody's just not in touch with it.

1463
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How you doing, Pat?  - Jesus.

1464
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming.

1465
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm taking him back to the hospital.

1466
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? No, no, he passed his thing, right?

1467
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First of all, check with the latest legal development.

1468
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we got a call that

1469
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law

1470
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so...

1471
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

1472
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?

1473
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm an Eagles fan.

1474
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well then, what's the problem?

1475
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not goin' anywhere.

1476
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let him finish the game, that's all.

1477
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The handkerchief is working.

1478
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seventen.

1479
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please!

1480
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what the hell you're talking about the handkerchief?

1481
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning,

1482
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I gotta take Danny McDaniels

1483
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}back to Baltimore, alright?

1484
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can contest his case from Baltimore.

1485
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

1486
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

1487
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used the insurance money to build this.

1488
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I designed it.

1489
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the floors are hard oak.

1490
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has good bounce for dancers.

1491
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares?

1492
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's therapy and it's fun.

1493
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the walls are good

1494
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.

1495
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:18,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you sleep?

1496
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it.

1497
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.

1498
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When are you gonna give it to her?

1499
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:27,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1500
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The letter to Nikki.

1501
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably tonight.

1502
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1503
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.

1504
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph.

1505
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did this thing about shakespeare and

1506
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how it's very romantic...

1507
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing,

1508
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can be able to do that because of all the training that...

1509
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's good, that's really good.

1510
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:47,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I assume you're a good teacher.

1511
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

1512
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?

1513
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.

1514
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's really generous.

1515
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, being of service.

1516
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. To your need.

1517
01:04:58,670 --> 01:04:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's start simple.

1518
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:02,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start at that corner, walk towards me.

1519
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walk across the room.

1520
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we do something else besides the dance deal?

1521
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you fucking kidding me?

1522
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm good with a hammer.

1523
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want me to fix something?

1524
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A deal is a deal.

1525
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Okay. I was just suggesting

1526
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that maybe there's a better scenario.

1527
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki.

1528
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the only way to convey how much you've missed me

1529
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is by your walk. By your slow walk.

1530
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't talk. Only walk.

1531
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not doing it.  - Do it.

1532
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. That's stupid.

1533
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No walk, no letter.

1534
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on.

1535
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.

1536
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not Nikki.

1537
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look up until you're halfway here.

1538
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Not yet.

1539
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you feel that? That's emotion.

1540
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't feel anything.

1541
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?

1542
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1543
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were married for three years and five days,

1544
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I loved him.

1545
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But for the last couple months,

1546
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wasn't into sex at all.

1547
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:24,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just felt like we were so different

1548
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I was depressed.

1549
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of that is just me,

1550
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some of it was he wanted me to have kids

1551
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself.

1552
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think that makes me a criminal.

1553
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway one night after dinner,

1554
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall

1555
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and got some lingerie to get something going.

1556
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy

1557
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed.

1558
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat.

1559
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a feeling.

1560
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whoa! Slow down.  - What?

1561
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father wanted you to have this.

1562
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants me to have-all this Eagles information.

1563
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's his living.  - Um, tell Dad thanks.

1564
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.

1565
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Football stays out of this place, so does Lord of the Flies.

1566
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing?

1567
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm behind on my syllabus.

1568
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't give a fuck.  - What the hell are you doing?

1569
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just throw that outside?

1570
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time.

1571
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you all about the Lord of the Flies.

1572
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch

1573
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they have a shell, and whoever has the conch

1574
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he has the power and they can talk.

1575
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power.

1576
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then there's a little chubby boy,

1577
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they call him Piggy

1578
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they're really mean,

1579
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then there's a murder.

1580
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:48,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.

1581
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. That was a great synopsis.

1582
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still need to read it, though.

1583
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

1584
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:58,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? What the...? What are you doing here, man?

1585
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If one of your two supervising physicians

1586
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}loses their license,

1587
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then your whole ajudication is thrown out.

1588
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you know we were here?

1589
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went by your parents' house looking for you

1590
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they told me you was over here.

1591
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danny, this is Tiffany.

1592
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiffany, this is Danny.

1593
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. Pat told me about you.

1594
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So is this the girl, that you wrote about?

1595
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? He wrote about me? I'm the girl?

1596
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He wrote about you, all right.  - What'd he say?

1597
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said you guys was helping each other out

1598
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you were nice and you...

1599
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you had a mouth on you, but...

1600
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

1601
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you were mouthy,

1602
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.

1603
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:28,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, anything you wanna know,

1604
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just tell you. It was nothing.

1605
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just a very general letter.

1606
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool.

1607
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's fine.  - She is my friend with an F.

1608
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A capital F?  - For friend.

1609
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I see what you guys are doing?

1610
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:50,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it?

1611
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What is it, what is it, what is it.

1612
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I say something? Do you mind?  - No.

1613
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You sure?  - Just say it. Say it.

1614
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, please.

1615
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:59,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.

1616
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you, Pat,

1617
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:01,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}let me show you what I mean.

1618
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man.

1619
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should move more hips.

1620
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And...

1621
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Can you move them a little bit more? Yeah, that's it.

1622
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move them a bit more.

1623
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that.

1624
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You're pretty good.

1625
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, we got it, we got it.

1626
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul.

1627
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Black it up, Pat.

1628
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is that mean?  - You know damn well what it means.

1629
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Black it up.

1630
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man!

1631
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got an idea.

1632
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come get some,Pat. Come get some.

1633
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back.

1634
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Girl, you gotta move your junk.

1635
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta get out of here.

1636
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go see this girl, Tanya.

1637
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She lives on this side of town.

1638
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

1639
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!

1640
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye! Excelsior, Pat!

1641
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excelsior!  - That's my man. Let's go!

1642
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patty. Patty.

1643
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where have you been?

1644
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that.

1645
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta beat the Giants

1646
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:57,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division,

1647
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}any chance of playing in the playoffs.

1648
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you realize that?

1649
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't realize that.  - Yeah, that's the bind we're in.

1650
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:10,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I think it would be wise if

1651
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we spent father-son time,

1652
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}reading about the Eagles, talking about them,

1653
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in.

1654
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. All right.

1655
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to,

1656
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe I didn't spend enough time with you growing up.

1657
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spent too much time with your brother.

1658
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It might have made you feel worse about your behavior,

1659
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I didn't know anything,

1660
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know how to handle it.

1661
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about.

1662
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about us, spending time now.

1663
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet.

1664
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the whole point.

1665
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:22,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you'd watch these games with me

1666
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we could talk, we could get into things.

1667
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So would you, would you just come downstairs

1668
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and talk to me and Randy now?

1669
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

1670
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's betting everything on the Giant game.

1671
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:42,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything.

1672
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the money that he needs for the restaurant,

1673
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's betting on the Giant game.

1674
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him why.

1675
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he believes in you.

1676
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that true?

1677
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe in you, Patty.

1678
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe in you. I want you to know that.

1679
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

1680
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You understand?

1681
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heavy.

1682
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to go to the game with your brother.

1683
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want me to go to the game with Jake?

1684
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I do. Does he want me to go?

1685
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course he wants you to go.

1686
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He told you that?  - He told me, yes.

1687
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with all his friends?

1688
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all his friends. He trusts you.

1689
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not embarrassed?

1690
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know,

1691
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm banned from the stadium.

1692
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'd love to see us beat the Giants

1693
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and take a lot of money from this asshole.

1694
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, personally,

1695
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's a stupid bet.

1696
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to

1697
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.

1698
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy. I just hope you heard what I said.

1699
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:42,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a family business,

1700
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's our family endeavor.

1701
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all stick together on this.

1702
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how it works.

1703
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a positive, positive vibe.

1704
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project,

1705
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we have a very important part of it

1706
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that we have to go over on Sunday,

1707
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's good for me, Dad.

1708
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's making me disciplined and focused,

1709
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's..., I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.

1710
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this thing you're doing?

1711
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what is it? What is this project, huh?

1712
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a dance thing, okay?

1713
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

1714
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I need to ask you something.

1715
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you

1716
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and half the day at the Eagles game?

1717
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.

1718
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:41,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1719
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are the two days that you have promised me

1720
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that we have prepared to nail the big move.

1721
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not ready yet.

1722
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we don't have a move yet.

1723
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, but my dad opened up to me

1724
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him,

1725
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:57,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up

1726
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he's concerned that because I'm spending time with you.

1727
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

1728
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're not messing up the juju,

1729
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the juju is messed up because

1730
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not with him during the games.

1731
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Guess what?  - What?

1732
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki replied to your letter.

1733
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can't read it until after you nail the big move.

1734
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

1735
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading

1736
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki's letter, okay?

1737
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just, it's in the back of my head.

1738
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't almost have it, all right?

1739
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I just hope you can handle it.  - Thank you.

1740
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was her energy when she gave it to you?

1741
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.

1742
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?

1743
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try to stay positive.

1744
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay?

1745
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because if she says anything that's,

1746
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:15,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know, is that too much to ask?

1747
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:16,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1748
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were gonna read it out loud.

1749
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Sorry.

1750
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dear Pat,

1751
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was very emotional for me to get your letter,

1752
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as I'm sure you can imagine,

1753
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly

1754
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}getting it to me through Tiffany.

1755
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This gives us a chance to communicate

1756
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.

1757
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must admit you sound terrific

1758
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive

1759
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:55,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and becoming a more loving and caring man,

1760
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I always knew you were.

1761
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was moved to read about 'excelsior'

1762
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your belief in happy endings.

1763
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am also moved by your act of love to read

1764
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the books I have taught at the high school.

1765
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry you find them so negative,

1766
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I disagree.

1767
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they are great works of art that

1768
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:25,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare

1769
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}themselves for the hardness of life.

1770
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:30,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In spite of all these positive developments, Pat,

1771
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to say if it's me reading the signs,

1772
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to see something to prove

1773
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you are ready to resume our marriage.

1774
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Otherwise I find myself thinking that

1775
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately.

1776
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't react quickly to this,

1777
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but take time to think about it.

1778
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:57,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad you're doing so well.

1779
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love, Nikki.

1780
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm done for today, okay?

1781
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said to show her something, Pat.

1782
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This dance can be that something.

1783
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would have never done something like this in a million years.

1784
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:29,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It shows all kinds of skills and so many different levels...

1785
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}focus, collaboration, discipline.

1786
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's romantic, like I said it would be.

1787
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for her.

1788
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

1789
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:59,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I use your phone?  - Is it an emergency?

1790
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, kind of.  - What kind of emergency?

1791
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany

1792
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:07,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.

1793
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know?

1794
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not crazy...

1795
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just borrow Jake's phone.

1796
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:16,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium,

1797
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I know you were kicked out, you know,

1798
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for beating everybody up.

1799
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?

1800
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That a bad thing?

1801

1819
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:31,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not supposed to be seeing you,

1820

01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' manning in the backfield

01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass

1830
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the line of scrimmage.

1831
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can say that again. Those cocksuckers!

1832
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you know what?

1833
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have her phone number.

1834
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want, if you really want,

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I don't want to talk to Veronica.

1838
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?

1839
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because she brings me down, man!

1840
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She just brings me down.  - You have to change.

1841
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna throw the marriage away.

1842
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's some kind of love there.

1843
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I used to see it.

1844
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys have a beautiful thing

1845
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that got broken somewhere along the line

1846
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor.

1847
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.

1848
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough with awkwardness!

1849
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna walk in your house

1850
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and not be able to say what I wanna say.

01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right, man. You're right, you're right,

1852
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,750

1855
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go back to your country!

1856
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, what's wrong?

1857

1858
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay back, Pat. Stay back.

1859
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:11,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave the fucking Indians alone.

1866
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd you do?

1867

1901
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you,

1902
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and my dad was pulling me in one direction.

1903
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:53,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor Patel, Ronnie...

1904
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that sounds great, Pat.

1905
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great for all of them,

1906
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:58,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but all of them

1907
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}didn't make a commitment to me

1908
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in return for my help.

1909
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Tiffany, by the way.

1910
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?

1911
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no craziness.

1912
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:11,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you who she was,

1913
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was doing this thing with her.

1914
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:13,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a conversation!

1915
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's fucking nuts!

1916
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you started spending time with her,

1917
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it all fell apart.

1918
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the fucking reason right here.

1919
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?

1920
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:23,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since...

1921
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think that I'm why today's happened?

1922
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right, you are why today happened.

1923
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the reason why today happened?

1924
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think so.  - Let's talk about that.

1925
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:31,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be my guest.

1926
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's,

1927
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:37,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Eagles beat the forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six.

1928
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The second time we got together we went for a run,

1929
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.

1930
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's right, Dad.

1931
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next time we went for a run

1932
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:48,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-seven to fourteen.

1933
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner

1934
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay

1935
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the fourth game of the World series, ten to two.

1936
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me think about that. Wait a minute.

1937
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you think about

1938
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.

1939
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was with you?

1940
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was with me. We went for a run.

1941
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:08,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? That's crazy.

1942
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There have been no games

1943
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day

1944
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to,

1945
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he wouldn't have gotten in a fight,

1946
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he wouldn't be in trouble,

1947
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.

1948
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's making a lot of sense, Pop.

1949
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right on all counts.

1950
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anybody here happen to know

1951
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what the official motto of the state of New York is

1952
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the official seal of the State of New York?

1953
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:35,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody? Do you? Do you know?

1954
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excelsior. Look it up. Yeah, Excelsior.

1955
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:39,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat.

1956
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that I give a fuck about football

1957
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or about your superstitions,

1958
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if it's me reading the signs,

1959
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:50,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't send the eagles guy whose personal motto is excelsior,

1960
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to a fucking Giants game,

1961
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}especially when he's already in a legal situation.

1962
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unbelievable.

1963
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you know all that stuff?

1964
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did my research.

1965
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta say, I'm impressed.

1966
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:05,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1967
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta rethink this whole thing.

1968
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't trust it before,

1969
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I gotta say, now I do.

1970
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you like her, Dad?

1971
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to say I do. Yup.

1972
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:21,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?

1973
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made the bet, I won a lot of money,

1974
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.

1975
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:30,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck off, Randy. You love it.

1976
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You live for this shit.

1977
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been betting against my father for years.

1978
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that right?

1979
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're twisting the knife right now.

1980
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get off on it!

1981
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's bullshit!

1982
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not true!

1983
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't say that!  - You get off on it!

1984
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prove it, prove it!

1985
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If not, then prove it. Prove it.

1986
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you want me to prove it?

1987
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's he gonna prove it?

1988
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I prove it?

1989
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By giving them the chance to win back everything,

1990
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}double or nothing.

1991
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1992
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week?

1993
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what you're saying?

1994
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Against the Cowboys.

1995
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's your team, isn't it, Randy?

1996
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:05,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's his team!

1997
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who his team is.

1998
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:09,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When is the game?

1999
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}December twenty-eight, last game of the season.

2000
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

2001
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same day as the Benjamin Franklin

2002

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.

2003
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh God.  - Randy, I thought they were America's Team.

2004
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you believe in America's Team?

2005
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:22,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?

2006
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I believe in America's team

2007
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if I win that bet,

2008
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I win your book,

2009
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're out of action,

2010
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you get no restaurant,

2011
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no nothing.

2012
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like it.

2013
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, Patrizio.

2014
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son,

2015
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take the action. I'll take it.

2016
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad!  - Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

2017
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have faith, I have faith.

2018
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excelsior belongs in this house.

2019
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad.  - Not in the State of New York.

2021
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:48,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, listen to me.

2022
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:49,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know that Excelsior

2023
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:50,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was the state motto of New York, okay?

2024
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know, either, but now I know.

2025
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, but listen to me, this is toxic.

2026
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic,

2027
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you shouldn't be doing this,

2028
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you shouldn't be doing...

2029
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy, what do you say?

2030
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough.

2031
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:01,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored

2032
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by one and a half points.

2033
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I 'll give you three more.

2034
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:04,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrizio, stop it!

2035
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:06,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Randy, don't you take the bet!

2036
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, I'll give you ten points.

2037
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:10,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Dad! Dad!

2038
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad!  - You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.

2039
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus!

2040
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:19,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could you not take that bet?

2041
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with the ten points I give you,

2042
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's an insane spread to your advantage.

2043
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cowboys are cowards.

2044
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll bet you're such a coward,

2045
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't take the ten.

2046
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, are you listening,

2047
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}plus whatever their score is at the dance thing.

2048
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that? Tiffany, what's that?

2049
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No. You're crazy to give away that many points.

2050
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's ridiculous!

2051
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't take that!

2052
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However, wait a second.

2053
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do like the idea of a parlay.

2054
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No parlay!

2055
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't do it. Don't do it.

2056
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, how do they run this dance competition?

2057
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, how do they score it and everything?

2058
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score!

2059
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're participating.

2060
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not, we're not a part of it.

2061
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are people.

2062
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a high-end dance contest.

2063
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

2064
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not put it as part of the parlay,

2065
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy. Don't.

2066
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They go by the Philadelphia rules.

2067
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten,

2068
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:08,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ten being the highest.

2069
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to average the four judges' scores.

2070
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, score is from one to ten, right?

2071
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:14,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you guys are how good?

2072
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:15,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We suck.

2073
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,

2074
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:19,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.

2075
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how are the people you're competing against?

2076
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're good. Some of them are professionals.

2077
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're good? Better than you?

2078
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot better.

2079
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:28,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot better.

2080
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if I was to say you only have to score five,

2081
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would be really very generous, right?

2082
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away...

2083
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten!

2084
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:40,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!

2085
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't get five!

2086
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can do a five.

2087
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about, Dad?

2088
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the parlay.

2089
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?

2090
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta win two bets

2091
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or you lose the whole thing.

2092
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For Pat Sr., to win,

2093
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the birds gotta beat the Cowboys

2094
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.

2095
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's very, very manic indeed.

2096
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the parlay.

2097
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shake on it.

2098
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:06,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this.

2099
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy, you're a sickness.

2100
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

2101
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, you can't quit.

2102
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

2103
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat.

2104
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}calm down. Thank about it.

2105
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, no.

2106
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

2107
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pat.  - I'm out.

2108
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are again at the one yard line.

2109
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

2110
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

2111
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:28,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does that even mean, dad?

2112
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna make that connection

2113
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:30,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're making with DeSean Jackson.

2114
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter anymore, okay?

2115
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because I have the fucking jersey on.

2116
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

2117
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are not a stand up guy right now.

2118
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's me reading the signs...

2119
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's you reading the signs?

2120
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.

2121
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are not a stand up guy!

2122
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:56,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you not to push it.

2123
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:58,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing.

2124
01:33:58,890 --> 01:33:59,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can't be a quitter.

2125
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cannot be a quitter.

2126
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took that stupid parlay thing,

2127
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:05,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now he won't do the dance

2128
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was very constructive for him,

2129
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you ruined it.

2130
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one way to get him to show.

2131
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

2132
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there.

2133
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She can't come.

2134
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to tell him that she's coming.

2135
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to tell him that she's going.

2136
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's a lie!

2137
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a white lie.

2138
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a white lie, what's that matter?

2139
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no big deal.

2140
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it's a little lie.

2141
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no other way.

2142
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs

2143
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:45,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can live his life

2144
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without ruining it.

2145
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I don't approve. You can't do it.

2146
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her

2147
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you told her where he was running,

2148
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so she could ambush him.

2149
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't approve of that,

2150
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you did it anyway,

2151
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:02,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

2152
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.

2153
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:10,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be part of it.

2154
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to do it.

2155
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you nervous to be lying?

2156
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little bit. But it's for the best.

2157
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:28,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if it was me reading the signs...

2158
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's it.  - Okay.

2159
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up?

2160
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry I'm late.  - It's fine.

2161
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, it's gonna be great.

2162
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:13,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nikki's gonna be there. You know?

2163
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's gonna come together.

2164
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:18,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what's meant to be. You okay?

2165
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get wobbly on me.

2166
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not.

2167
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:26,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a dance to do.

2168
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:26,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a parlay.

2169
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:27,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta stay focused.

2170
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:28,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm focused.

2171
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let's go.

2172
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at the dancers. You see them?  - Shit.

2173
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy, Jake. What do we got?

2174
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three.

2175
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm worried about the bet.

2176
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about the bet.

2177
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm worried about the bet.

2178
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

2179
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this Dancing with the Stars?

2180
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted them.

2181
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at those fucking dancers!

2182
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:23,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can give me the money now, you know?

2183
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:26,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five.

2184
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's all.  - You stay here and watch the game with me.

2185
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:29,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The birds are better when Pat is with me.

2186
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:30,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We settled that.

2187
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay?

2188
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you in a little bit.

2189
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll see you up there, okay?  - Okay.

2190
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pat, Tiffany!

2191
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:40,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.

2192
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right, buddy, I'll see you.  - Alright.

2193
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wish me luck, man.

2194
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excelsior!

2195
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:49,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, what's this?

2196
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I thought you were doing it.

2197
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were doing it.

2198
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake.

2199
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to remember everything.

2200
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:05,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.

2201
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:06,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I do.

01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't know if Nikki ever did,

2304
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but she sure as hell doesn't love you right now.

2305
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.

2306
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:23,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, Dad.

2307
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you just leave me alone?

2308
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second!

2309
01:52:58,110 --> 01:52:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have one more letter for you to read, okay?

2310
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is the matter with you?

2311
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it to her yourself!

2312
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me say something.

2313
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't ever have to see me again

2314
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you just read it, alright?

2315
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is so fucked up.

2316
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, just read it.

2317
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:12,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear Tiffany...

2318
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:18,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you wrote the letter.

2319
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:28,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way you could meet my craziness

2320
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was by doing something crazy yourself.

2321
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

2322
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:34,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

2323
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:40,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it the minute I met you.

2324
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up.

2325
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:48,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just got stuck. Pat.

2326
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wrote that a week ago.

2327
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:56,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wrote that a week ago?

2328
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I did.

2329
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You let me lie to you for a week?

2330
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was trying to be romantic.

2331
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love me?

2332
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:08,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I do.

2333

01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's guaranteed.

2336
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't begin to explain that

2337
01:54:56,830 --> 01:54:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the craziness inside myself and everybody else,

2338
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:00,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but guess what?

2341
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:09,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I feel like a very lucky guy.

2342
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to beat the Vikings by three.

2343

01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is very generous

2345
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after the beating you just took.

2346
