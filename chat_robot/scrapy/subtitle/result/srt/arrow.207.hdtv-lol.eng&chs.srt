1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,067
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:06,900
经历岛上地狱般的五年后
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,434
我回来了 心怀一个目标...
I have come home with only one goal...

4
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:11,867
拯救这座城市
To save my city.

5
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:16,900
但为此我不能再像以前一样杀戮
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,034
为了祭奠我的好友
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:22,000
我必须重塑自己
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,700
我必须伪装自身
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,334
"绿箭侠" 前情提要...
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:29,700
他已经没有利用价值了
This one's no longer of use to us.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,501
等等 他还有利用价值
Wait. He could still be useful.

12
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,934
没错 一旦除掉他的那几个朋友
She's right. Once we get rid of his friends,

13
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,100
我们需要他带领我们去墓地
we'll need him to lead us to the grave.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,634
你要回炼狱岛
You're going back to the island.

15
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,634
你已经失去了父亲
Look, you already lost your dad.

16
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:42,367
但是你母亲还在 她一定很想见你 
Your mom, she's still here. And I'm sure she'd love to see you.

17
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,234
我不会去监狱看她
I'm not going to that prison.

18
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,301
这是唯一能够报复她的方式
It's the only way I know how to hurt her.

19
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:49,100
我真的很想恨你
And I want to hate you.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,401
但是我做不到
But I can't.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,833
我们之间没什么秘密可言
I didn't think that there were secrets kept between us.

22
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,733
妈妈... 你到底在隐瞒什么?
Mom... what are you hiding now?

23
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,967
我叫Moira Dearden Queen
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.

24
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:06,800
我是Queen氏实业的执行总裁

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,267
愿上帝原谅 我辜负了这座城市
And, God forgive me, I have failed this city.

26
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:13,467
我被迫参与
I have been complicit in an undertaking

27
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:16,034
一项极其恐怖的阴谋...
with one horrible purpose...

28
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:22,467
摧毁贫民区的一切
to destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

29
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,534
如果你住在贫民区
If you reside in the glades,

30
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,167
请马上离开那里
please, you need to get out now.

31
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:30,334
你们和你们的孩子正命悬一线
Your lives and the lives of your children depend on it.

32
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:32,568
请离开那里
Please.

33
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:36,201
狱长要我们马上撤离
Warden says we got to evacuate.

34
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,601
帮忙把这些运走
Help me get these out of here.

35
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,434
- 那些犯人呢?  - 让他们自生自灭
- What about the inmates?  - Leave 'em.

36

喂?
Huh?

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,267
不错
Hmm.

40
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,334
啊哈
Ahh.

41
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:31,601
- 这边 放我出去  - 不
- Over here, let me out.  - No.

42
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,634
- 把钥匙给我!  - 不 不行 你太暴力  
- Give me the keys!  - No, no, too violent.

43
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:37,733
- 放了我!  - 你太懒 你太笨
- Take me!  - Sloppy, too stupid.

44
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,934
你呢... 太狂
Too... ambitious.

45
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:43,267
至于你 
You.

46
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,234
我很喜欢你的"职业"
I love your work.

47
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:47,267
前途无量
Big future.

48
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,634
嘿 出去后要小心 
Hey, be careful.

49
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:51,000
余震会不断来袭的
There's liable to be aftershocks.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,568
哦 我还挺期待的呢
Oh, I'm counting on it.

51
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:16,867

绿箭侠 第二季 第七集

52
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:30,367
Queen先生 你母亲的案子怎么样了?
Mr. Queen, what are your mother's chances?

53
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:33,601
她是在接受防自杀观察吗?
Is she on suicide watch?

54
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,668
Queen先生 有什么想说的吗?
Mr. Queen, can you give us any comment?

55
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:38,000
这不公平 他们又不是要受审的人
It's not fair. They're not the ones on trial.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,134
Jean Loring会一直用他们来博取大众同情的
That won't stop Jean Loring from using them as props to drum up sympathy.

57
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,000
你似乎对此不太关心
You don't seem overly concerned.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,934
她在电视直播中承认自己是共犯
She confessed to being an accomplice on live television.

59
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,334
她还说是Malcolm Merlyn强迫她的
She also sad that Malcolm Merlyn coerced her.

60
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,301
你掌握了什么?
You have something, don't you?

61
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,767
Adam 我认为作为合伙律师
I thought I was your co-counsel, Adam.

62
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,367
如果你掌握了本案的关键证据 难道不应该告诉我吗?
If you're holding a trump card, don't you think maybe you should share it with me?

63
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:59,434
这将是一场别开生面的审判
It's going to be a good trial.

64
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:02,700
进去吧
Come on, let's get inside.

65
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,900
你们没必要赶尽杀绝
You don't have to do this.

66
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,668
Ivo给我们下的命令
Ivo says we do.

67
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,100
你的朋友对他们是个威胁
Your friends are a danger to his men.

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,733
闭嘴 快点走
Go. Quick and quiet.

69
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,568
Slade! Shado! 快跑!
Slade! Shado! Run!

70
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,367
里面没人
There's no one here.

71
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,334
他们一定逃跑了
They must have moved on from their position.

72
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,134
炸弹已安好 这是引爆器
Chargers are set. Here's the detonator.

73
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,800
让他们在这里无处藏身
Make sure they have no place to return to.

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,767
去吧
Go.

75
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,668
至于你
And you.

76
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,434
给我们带路去墓地
Now you're going to take us to the graves.

77
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,767
走吧 把他弄起来
Let's go. Get him up.

78
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:57,267
注意四周
Let's get clear.

79
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:02,367
找到引爆装置了吗?
Did you find the detonator?

80
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,467
找到了
Yes.

81
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,067
我们很幸运
We were lucky.

82
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:11,534
我很幸运 你是幸运女神
I was lucky. You were good.

83
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:13,434
随便怎么说吧...
Either way...

84
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,134
他们抓住了Oliver
They have Oliver.

85
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:17,568
我要去救他
I'm going after him.

86
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,668
我跟你一起
Not alone.

87
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:22,568
你走路都费劲
You can barely walk.

88
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,800
这里不能久留
All the more reason not to stay here.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,134
不能让他们再来把我炸飞
Give them another chance at blowing me up.

90
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,434
你们还好吧?
Are you two ok?

91
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,267
这个问题应该我来问你
I should be asking you that question.

92
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,367
我没事
I'll be fine.

93
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,401
你好像得了流感
You look like you have the flu.

94
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,434
要是得了流感 那当初的疫苗就白接种了
If that's true, I shouldn't have wasted my time getting vaccinated.

95
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:44,800
Diggle 不管怎样 你还是回去休息一下吧
Diggle, whatever it is, just go home.

96
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,067
Oliver 我没事
Oliver, listen, I can take care of things.

97
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,100
我们不会有事的 
No, we'll be fine, all right?

98
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,067
回去休息吧 别逼我叫警察把你拖回去
Go rest. And don't make me call a cop.

99
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,534
有几个警察在附近哟
There are a few of them around here.

100
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,534
我被迫参与
I have been complicit in an undertaking

101
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,334
一项恐怖的阴谋...
with one horrible purpose...

102
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:29,634
摧毁贫民区的一切
to destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

103
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:32,100
阴谋得逞了 贫民区被摧毁了
And it worked. The Glades were destroyed.

104
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,334
人们流离失所
Homes and lives were lost.

105
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,467
全都归罪于她
All because of her actions.

106
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,934
虽然她悔过了 
True, she had second thoughts, remorse which

107
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:41,867
因自责而发表了以上声明
compelled her to deliver this statement.

108
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,034
但作为那天
But on behalf of the 503 lives

109
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,367
丧生的503人的代表
that were extinguished that day,

110
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:50,000
我觉得Moira Queen的自责声明来的太迟了
I say, Moira Queen, your remorse comes too late.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,201
在过去的五年里
For the last five years,

112
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,334
他以我和我家人的生命
under the threat for my life

113
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,034
来威胁我...
and the lives of my family...

114
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:59,034
为什么这些威胁会让她妥协?
Why wouldn't those threats silence her?

115
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:02,334
为什么Moira Queen非常害怕?
Why wouldn't Moira Queen be terrified?

116
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,034
因为Malcolm Merlyn谋杀了她的第一任丈夫
Malcolm Merlyn killed her first husband,

117
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:08,367
然后绑架了她的第二人丈夫 她怎么能不担忧自己的生命呢?
abducted her second. Why wouldn't she be in fear for her life?

118
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,000
怎么能不担心她孩子的安危呢?
For the lives of her children?

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,534
你碰到这种情况会怎么做?
What would you do?

120
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,568
要是你孩子的生命
If it were your children in the crosshairs

121
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,900
被一个疯子威胁 你会怎么做?
of a mad man's rage?

122
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,634
他们说S.T.A.R.实验室的粒子加速器
They say S.T.A.R. Lab's particle accelerator

123
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,967
将会按计划开启
will be turned on right on schedule.

124
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,833
来自其他方面的报道
In other news, we have just received word

125
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,401
有消息称控辩双方就Moira Queen的案子
that both sides have now completed their opening statements

126
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,568
都做了陈述
in the Moira Queen trial.

127
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,501
别误会 我觉得你看起来很不好
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look disgusting.

128
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,501
没错 Felicity 我是不太舒服
Yeah, well, I don't feel great, Felicity.

129
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:39,401
要怎么才能好点呢?
Is there a right way to take that?

130
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:40,867
你应该回去休息
You should go home.

131
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,867
就要回去了
I am going.

132
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,467
我要安排一个替班保镖
I just need to make arrangements for a replacement bodyguard.

133
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,334
你接种过防流感疫苗吗? 我是没有
Did you get the flu shot? Personally, I never do.

134
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,434
虽然知道有必要接种 但是我晕针
I know that I should. I just, I have this thing about needles.

135
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,234
所有尖的东西 我都害怕
All pointy things, really.

136
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,334
讽刺的是 我们还得跟用弓箭的人搭伙工作
Which is ironic, considering who we work with.

137
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,568
这不是流感 Felicity 感觉更像是...
Yeah, it's not the flu, Felicity, it's more like...

138
00:07:57,568 --> 00:08:00,034
Dig! 你怎么了?
Dig!

139
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,201
有人吗?
Hello?

140
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,534
你在吗?
Are you here?

141
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:08,467
在这里... 在那里...
Here... there...

142
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,568
无处不在
Everywhere.

143
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,301
那么
So.

144
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:14,634
我们的科研进展如何?
How goes our little science project?

145
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,833
跟你预期的一样
Working like you said it would.

146
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,800
真不错
How wonderful.

147
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,668
听我说
Ah, so listen.

148
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,800
研究的薪酬是五万块
Doing the thing was 50,000.

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
要想让我封口的话
Keeping quiet about it,

150
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
就得给我二十五万
I'm thinking it should be 50 more.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,401
是吗
Hmm.

152
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,568
我不需要封口
Oh, I want word to spread.

153
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:34,800
实际上 这是我计划的一部分
It's kind of the whole objective, actually.

154
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,701
懂我的意思吗?
You see my point?

155
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:43,567
你应该知道 事后谈判...
You should know, I find post hoc negotiation...

156
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,800
收场不会愉快的
Distasteful.

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,601
啊
Ahh.

158
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,434
真遗憾 医生
Such a shame you won't get to see

159
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,833
你看不到自己的杰作了
what your works have wrought, doctor.

160
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,367
但是过不了多久 大家都会感受到的
But soon, everyone else will.

161
00:08:55,715 --> 00:09:00,121
而他们会求我结束痛苦
And they'll beg for me to end.

162
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,106
你怎么会在这里?
What the hell are you doing here?

163
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,366
我听说你晕倒了?
I heard you passed out.

164
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:14,041
我告诉Felicity不要给你打电话
I told Felicity not to call you.

165
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,541
没错 在此之前 你还说了"水沟" 和"子弹"
Yeah, but before that, you said "gaw" and "thud,"

166
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,241
不过我没太在意
So I didn't take it very seriously.

167
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:19,408
他给我电话是明智之举 Diggle 你需要去医院 
She was right to call me. Diggle, you need medical attention.

168
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,220
他需要的不止是去医院 Dig昏厥的时候
He needs more than that. When Dig passed out,

169
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,374
我采集了他的血液样本 送到一位搞质量检测的化学师那里检测
I sent a sample of his blood to a chemist I know at QC.

170
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:25,714
那家伙欠我一个人情 一言难尽 我帮他搞定了违章罚单
The guy owes me a favor. Long story, I fixed his parking ticket.

171
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,747
啊哈 也不是一言难尽
Huh. I guess it's not that long.

172
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:30,614
Felicity 重点是血液样本检测
Felicity. The blood sample.

173
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,614
没错 检测结果显示... 迷魂药检阳性
Yeah. It came back positive... for trace amounts of vertigo.

174
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,747
我从来没服用过迷魂药
I never used vertigo before in my life.

175
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:36,547
可能是无意间摄入的
You were exposed to it somehow.

176
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,014
迷魂药又出现了?
Vertigo's in play again?

177
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:39,714
"伯爵"从他的迷魂药恢复过来后
When the count recovered

178
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:41,315
被送到了铁山监狱
from his od on vertigo, he was sent to Iron Heights.

179
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,081
那里被地震破坏了
That got hit in the quake.

180
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,514
他和那个"洋娃娃制作师"一样越狱了吗?
He got out the same way the doll maker did?

181
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:49,315
就跟那个案犯一样
And just like with the doll maker,

182
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:53,514
监狱官方发言一直在掩盖事实
Prison officials worked overtime to keep the lid on the escape.

183
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:58,348
- 我知道你想做什么  -  不 你不知道
- I know what you're thinking.  - No, you don't.

184
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,747
我曾经放了他一命
I made a choice not to put an arrow in this guy.

185
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,580
当时的决定是对的
And it was the right choice.

186
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,415
我不会再杀戮
There's no more killing.

187
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,714
我要消除迷魂药这个祸患
I worked this up to counteract the effects of vertigo.

188
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:09,914
给Diggle注射这个 我...
Give it to Diggle. I...

189
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:12,114
我还要回法庭
I need to get back to court.

190
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,214
这段时间 你尽量查一下
While I'm gone, just work up whatever you can

191
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,348
Diggle是怎么在不知不觉中摄入迷魂药的
and figure out how Diggle got vertigo in his system without his knowledge.

192
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:19,714
交给我吧 
Ok. Go.

193
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:25,647
你是什么时候知道关于这场阴谋的消息?
When was the first time you heard about this so-called undertaking?

194
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:30,014
跟大家一样 在我母亲现场发表声明的时候
When everyone else did, when my mother gave the press conference.

195
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,814
看起来你有点接受不了?
Doesn't seem like you took it too well.

196
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,381
我很震惊
I was surprised.

197
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,814
大家都很震惊
Who wouldn't be?

198
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:42,480
你母亲在那之后很快被拘捕
Uh, your mother was, um, immediately take into custody,

199
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,181
我可以假设你去监管区探望过她?
but I assume you went down to the precinct to see her?

200
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,415
事实上 我在她被转移之后才去看过她
Um, actually I didn't see her until she was moved.

201
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,315
去监狱看望
To the prison.

202
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,248
你记得是什么时候去见她的吗?
Do you remember when you visited her?

203
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:54,547
呃 记不起确切的日期了
Uh, not the exact date.

204
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:58,547
没关系 我这有拜访者记录
It's ok. I have the visitor log here.

205
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:00,081
10月9日
October ninth.

206
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,348
五个月之后
Five months later.

207
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:04,081
为什么这么久?
Why so long?

208
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,081
呃 我... 我...
Um, I... I...

209
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,580
你没事吧?
Are you ok?

210
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,547
请回答
An answer, please.

211
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,148
为什么要等五个月之后才去看你妈妈?
Why did it take you five months to visit your mother?

212
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:17,248
- 法官大人 如果我...  - 不
- Your honor, if I...  - No.

213
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,514
我也想听下
I want to hear this.

214
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,081
我需要时间
I needed time.

215
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,714
我当时...
I was...

216
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:25,514
愤怒 也许是很愤怒
Angry. So angry, perhaps,

217
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:28,948
以致于你要5个月后才原谅她?
that it took you five months to forgive her?

218
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,681
是百感交集
It was complicated.

219
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:33,381
不 其实很简单
No. It's very simple.

220
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:36,948
你责怪你母亲的所作所为
You blamed your mother for what she had done.

221
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,580
那陪审团为什么不可以责怪?
So why shouldn't the jury?

222
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,547
法官大人 我们对... 证人
Your honor, we have no further questions

223
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:47,148
没有其他问题了
for the... witness.

224
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,048
噢 Adam!
Adam!

225
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:01,181
在哪里?
Where is it?

226
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,914
说啊 到底在哪里?!
Come on, where is it?!

227
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:07,381
回转石在哪里?
The hosen, where is it?

228
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:08,714
什么?
What?

229
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:10,214
箭头
The arrowhead.

230
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,381
报道都说和这些尸体一起的
Every report said it was with these bodies.

231
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,781
你说你和你朋友来过这
You said you and your friends were here.

232
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,714
快说在哪?
Now, where is it?

233
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:19,114
带他出去
Take him outside.

234
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,747
让他指出他朋友的藏身之处
Make him show you where his friends are hiding.

235
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:28,614
带我们去找他们
Take us to them.

236
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,614
我不知道他们在哪!
I don't know where they are!

237
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:32,881
噢!
Oww!

238
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,747
告诉我 否则你的手就废了
Tell me, or you lose your hand.

239
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,614
我们选另外一条路
Let us suggest another option.

240
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:40,514
把他交过来 就留你们几条生命
You hand the kid over to us, and we don't kill you all.

241
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,914
喂 你没事吧?
Hey, are you ok?

242
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:57,114
别担心 我承受得住
Don't worry about me. I can take it.

243
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,580
是不是真的那么糟糕?
Was that as bad as it seemed?

244
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,181
你说Thea的证词吗? 现在中场休息了
Thea's testimony? It was a set-back.

245
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:22,547
我们指望她...
We were counting on her to...

246
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:23,948
让我人性化点
Humanize me.

247
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:25,681
坦白说 对的
Frankly, yes.

248
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,714
现在我们得用其他方式了
And now we're going to have to go another way.

249
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,048
不 不 我跟你说过 我不要作证
No. No, I told you, I won't testify.

250
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,081
你说过 但是现在必须作证了
I know you did. But now you have to.

251
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:35,181
她说的没错 妈妈
She's right, mom.

252
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,881
Jean 可以让我们私谈一下吗?
Jean, can you give us a minute?

253
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,547
好的
Yeah.

254
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,315
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're going to say.

255
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:48,714
但如果我作证的话 就会毁掉我们的家
But if I testify, it will destroy our family.

256
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:52,281
如果你的律师没错的话 你没有其他选择
And if your lawyer's right, you don't have a choice.

257
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:55,048
妈妈 就是因为秘密导致你现在的处境
Mom, secrets are what put you in this situation.

258
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:58,348
秘密和谎言
Secrets and lies.

259
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,048
现在是时候
And now it is time

260
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,747
说真话了
to give the truth its day.

261
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,580
现在 我不想大家忽略
Now, I don't want us to lose sight

262
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,714
今天法庭发生的另外一个重大事件
of the other major event in court today.

263
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:13,348
有征兆显示Adam Donner病了吗?
Was there any indication of Adam Donner being ill?

264
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:17,480
没有 在Donner先生晕倒之前没有任何预兆
No, there was very little warning before Mr. Donner collapsed to the ground.

265
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,415
我问过出席法庭的几个人...
I've spoken to several people that were in the courtroom with me...

266
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,348
你感觉怎样?
How are you feeling?

267
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:24,714
还好
Fine.

268
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,181
你面无表情 Diggle
You have a lousy poker face, Diggle.

269
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,981
他吃解药了吗?
Did he take the antidote?

270
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:30,181
没用 "伯爵"肯定在他的处方做了手脚
Didn't work. The Count must have futzed with his recipe.

271
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:31,614
听说Donner的事了
Heard what happened with Donner

272
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,415
在法庭上和Thea的事
at the court, and with Thea.

273
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,148
她怎么样?
How is she?

274
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:36,981
会没事的
Going to be fine.

275
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:39,647
你也面无表情 和我差不多 Oliver
Your poker face isn't much better than mine, Oliver.

276
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,248
- 你好 Starling市  - Felicity!
- Hello, Starling City.  - Felicity!

277
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:46,747
想我吗?
Miss me?

278
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:49,415
你们多数人应该感觉到身体不适吧...
Many of you have noticed that you're not feeling quite like yourselves...

279

他占领了当地所有的食物站

追踪信号发射地

281
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:55,114
和我们能干的助理检察官一样
Like our good assistant district attorney here.

282
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,681
你们大概已经从在审的
You might recognize him from his work

283
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:59,281
Moira Queen案上认识了他
in the ongoing Moira Queen trial.

284
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,981
- 喂 Adam  - 你想怎样
- Hi, Adam.  - What do you want?

285
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,981
我想如你所愿
I want what you want.

286
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,181
让你感觉好点
For you to feel better.

287
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:08,981
见鬼去吧!
Go to hell!

288
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,480
我觉得你也想结束痛苦了
I do think you want the pain to end,

289
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,647
我可以...
and I can do that...

290
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,781
用迷魂药帮你
with vertigo.

291
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,381
这就是你身体渴望的
It's what all of your bodies crave.

292
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,614
幸运的是 解药就在这
Fortunately, the power of relief is right here.

293
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,415
你只需去找你家附近
And all you have to do is go to your friendly

294
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,048
友善的迷魂药经销商寻求解药
neighborhood vertigo dealer and request the cure.

295
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,281
只是简单供求关系
Simply supply and demand at work.

296
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:32,415
只要说你想要
Now, tell me you want this

297
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,614
它就是你的了
And it's yours.

298
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:38,847
所有痛苦就会... 消失
All the pain will just... disappear.

299
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,348
说吧
Say it.

300
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,315
说...
Say...

301
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:45,480
你想要
You want it.

302
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,881
我... 我... 想... 我想要
I... I... want... I want it.

303
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,681
你看... 多简单的解决办法
You see... a simple solution.

304
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,781
我是迷魂药伯爵
I'm Count Vertigo,

305
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,547
批准你如此销魂
And I approve this high.

306
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,814
现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

307
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:15,048
去找他...
We find him...

308
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,564
然后干掉他
and shut him down

309
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:28,014
他是在哪拍的?
Where did he broadcast from?

310
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:30,214
他弹回了S.T.A.R.实验室卫星的信号
He bounced the signal off of S.T.A.R. Lab's satellite.

311
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:31,947
有可能是从Markovia发来的
He could have sent that transmission from Markovia.

312
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,481
他肯定会以当地会据点
He would want to stay local.

313
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:35,347
分解画面 若有必要 就一帧一帧来
Scrub the footage, frame by frame if you have to.

314
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,881
这上面有线索 我们可以找到
There's something on here that gives us a clue

315
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,514
- 他的位置  - 如果他给整座城市下药了
- to where he is.  - If he dosed the whole city,

316
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:41,181
为什么只有部分人有症状?
why are only some people showing symptoms?

317
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,815
可能是有选择的
Maybe exposure was selective.

318
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,614
"伯爵"在一些只有部分人群
Count contaminated something that only certain people,

319
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:46,815
像你和Donner使用的东西中下药了
like you and Donner, consumed.

320
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,681
最戏剧性的改变
A most dramatic turn.

321
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,815
城市高官都在维稳
City officials are urging calm,

322
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,915
希望不会引起大规模恐慌
hoping to avoid widespread panic.

323
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,614
Levitz副市长有...
Deputy Mayor Levitz has...

324
00:16:56,614 --> 00:17:00,314
"伯爵"把Starling市变成了吸毒城
The Count has turned Starling into a city of junkies.

325
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:02,881
追踪到他藏Adam Donner的地点了吗?
Any leads on where he's holding Adam Donner?

326
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:07,448
不 心寒的是 我有其他担忧了
Hmm, no. As cold as it sounds, I've got other concerns.

327
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:08,748
Laurel啊?
Laurel?

328
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,514
Adam的审讯笔记很详细
Adam's trial notes are very thorough.

329
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,848
最好是这样 你现在首席律师了
They better be. You're lead counsel now.

330
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:15,314
Spencer女士 你可是地方检察官啊
Ms. Spencer, you're the district attorney.

331
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:18,714
对 但陪审团只认识你
Yes, but you're the one that the jury knows.

332
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:24,548
你可以做好的 Laurel
You'll do fine, Laurel.

333
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:26,848
我知道
I know.

334
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,714
我刚发现Adam的杀手锏了
I just found Adam's trump card.

335
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,648
我想自己清静下
I just want to be left alone.

336
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,748
可惜你做不了主
Well, too bad that's not an option for you.

337
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,781
但我知道这样有用
But maybe I know something that is.

338
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:57,114
打我
Hit me.

339
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:58,714
什么?
What?

340
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,381
你知道为什么我以前总是晚上出去
You wonder why I used to go out at night

341
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,614
和坏家伙们打架吗?
looking to throw down with bad guys?

342
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,448
一方面是为了帮助这个城市
Part of it was to help the city.

343
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:10,748
另一方面是
And the other part

344
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,080
帮助自己
was to help me.

345
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,815
揍街头小混混对你有帮助?
Getting tuned up by street thugs helped you?

346
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:18,681
对 我有付出也有收获
Yeah, well, I gave as good as I got.

347
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,214
我们试试
There we go.

348
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:24,815
我想出拳打架时 感觉很愤怒
When I would throw a punch, I'd be so angry.

349
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:27,648
有一团火在我内心燃起
I'd feel this heat rising inside of me,

350
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,281
在下巴 在心中
in my jaw. In my chest.

351
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,448
和拳头上
And my fists.

352
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:37,314
但我得暂时躲一躲
But I needed somewhere to go.

353
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:39,815
来
Come on.

354
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:47,047
Thea 你很不爽
Thea, you're angry.

355
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:50,181
因为你妈妈 因为律师事务所 还有你自己
At your mother, the D.A., yourself, maybe.

356
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,681
如果你不发泄出来
But that anger is going to chew up your insides

357
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,381
愤怒就会吞噬你
if you don't let it out.

358
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:55,947
我不想揍你 Roy
I'm not going to hit you, Roy.

359
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,648
试一下
Try.

360
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:00,047
试一下!
Try!

361
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:04,947
我说的是揍我 对吧? 你这样...
I said hit me, right? 'Cause that felt like...

362
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:08,748
根本不算
that didn't really feel like anything.

363
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,848
好一点 握紧你的拳头
Better. But keep your wrists straight.

364
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,114
不要只是摆摆胳膊
Don't just use your arm.

365
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:15,147
要用尽全力
Put your entire body into it.

366
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,915
再来一次
Come on, again.

367
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,648
至少让我给Lyla打个电话吧
At least let me call Lyla.

368
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,481
那样只会让她担心我
All she could do is worry about me.

369
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,980
我有新发现
I found something.

370
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,314
我没看明白
I don't see anything.

371
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,014
因为你还没看到Donner看到的
Because you have to see what Donner does.

372
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:55,014
他眼睛有反射的图像
His eye caught a reflection.

373
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:56,381
能放大点吗?
Can you enhance?

374
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:59,247
这都问 真让我伤心
It hurts me that you feel a need to ask.

375
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:01,481
那是什么 翅膀吗?
What are those, wings?

376
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:02,881
是一个徽标
It's the city seal.

377
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,381
Starling市政档案部
Starling Municipal Records Department.

378
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,947
自从实行了数字化办公
That building's been abandoned

379
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,581
那栋楼就被弃用了
since the city went to digital. Dollars to donuts,

380
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,514
那里肯定就是伯爵的老巢
that's where the Count is operating out of.

381
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,714
不再是了
Not for long.

382
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:21,214
你不应该来
You shouldn't be here.

383
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:22,881
- 我的律师要...  - Moira
- My attorney needs...  - Moira.

384
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:26,581
我知道跟你谈话可能会让我吊销执照
I know I could be disbarred for speaking with you,

385
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,815
但我不是以律师身份来的
but this isn't something for lawyers.

386
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:31,648
我想和你谈谈你的家庭
This is a family matter.

387
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:44,781
Jean告诉我 明天她会提问你
Jean told me she's calling you to the stand tomorrow.

388
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,581
是的
Yes.

389
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,648
但你不能作证
You can't testify.

390
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,214
哦
Well.

391
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,548
Laurel 你不想让我作证
The fact that you don't want me to, Laurel,

392
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,381
更说明我应该作证
is a good indication that I should.

393
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:02,047
如果你作证 我就必须盘问你
If you take the stand, I’ll have to cross examine you,

394
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:04,047
那样我就必须竭尽全力
and I’ll have to do it to the best of my ability.

395
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:06,980
- 我明白  - 不 你不明白
- Yes, I understand.  - No, I don't think you do.

396
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:22,548
先不说这会给Oliver和Thea带来什么影响
Forget about what this will do to Oliver and Thea.

397
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,947
这些会彻底摧毁你的案子
It also could undermine your entire case.

398
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:29,947
Moira 求你了
So, Moira, please.

399
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:31,614
求你了
Please.

400
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,381
别逼我用上这些
Don't make me use this.

401
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:37,581
现在你在危险关头
Everything is at stake for you.

402
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:39,881
我不希望是我让你万劫不复
And I don't want to be the one to take it all away.

403
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:45,947
快一点
Faster, please.

404
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:49,714
快点! 全城的人都想买
Faster! We have a city full of customers.

405
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:52,281
千真万确
And I mean this literally.

406
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:55,247
需求量不断加大 我觉得设备有点不够用
I'm afraid my production apparatus is a little over-taxed

407
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,014
虽然我倒不介意
with the increased demand. I can live with it, though.

408
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,648
但是买家们可不能忍啊
I can't say the city can.

409
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:04,014
快走
Go.

410
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:06,381
别动
Be still, my heart.

411
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:19,114
放开他们
Step away from them.

412
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:22,281
听说你已经厌倦杀人了
Yes, I’ve heard you've developed an allergy to killing.

413
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:24,681
- 快点离开!  - 要不然呢?
- Do it!  - Or what?

414
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:27,414
把我杀了?
You'll kill me?

415
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,181
你真的不再杀人了?
You're really on the no killing wagon?

416
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,147
真是悲哀
Shame.

417
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:53,381
你错过了人生的一大乐事
Really letting one of life's true pleasures pass you by.

418
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:04,281
你说过你不想出庭作证了
But you said you didn't want to testify.

419
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:07,281
但又不得不去
But you have to.

420
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,647
- 为了我  - 不
- Because of me.  - No.

421
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:10,814
你必须保护好自己
You have to do damage control.

422
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,281
因为你是无辜的
None of this is your fault.

423
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,480
都是受了我的牵连
We're here because of what I did.

424
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:17,580
你们已经知道了真相
Now, you both know the truth,

425
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,814
但那些不是全部真相
but you don't know all of it.

426
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,948
Laurel知道全部
Laurel does.

427
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:24,214
她知道什么了?
What does she have?

428
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,514
这些事你们不能从法庭上获知
You shouldn't have to find this out in court.

429
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:31,514
什么事?
Find out what?

430
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:39,081
很多年前...
Years ago... it was many yes ago...

431
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:44,814
你爸爸有很多次...
your father was engaging in his...

432
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:48,814
很多次外遇
his extramarital activities.

433
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:52,714
我一时失足
And I had a moment of weakness.

434
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:58,814
也出轨了
I cheated on him.

435
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,847
和Malcolm Merlyn
With Malcolm Merlyn.

436
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:07,114
不
No.

437
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:10,114
不 我...
No, I...

438
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:12,580
我问过你的
I asked you about this.

439
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,281
去年
Last year.

440
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:18,181
你说你们俩是清白的!
You said that there was nothing between you two!

441
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,747
宝贝 那都算不上是外遇
There wasn't. Sweetheart, it wasn't an affair.

442
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:23,248
就是一时冲动 而且过去了很久
It was very brief, and a long time ago.

443
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:26,014
尽管如此 你还继续和Merlyn先生做朋友
And despite it, you remained friends with Mr. Merlyn.

444
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:29,048
事实上 他是你们家派对上的常客
In fact, he frequently attended parties at your home.

445
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:32,580
在我丈夫被杀之前 Malcolm是他的挚友
He was my husband's best friend until Malcolm killed him.

446
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,714
这就是你为什么说
And this is why you claimed to feel

447
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:36,415
你担心你自己
as though you were in fear for your life

448
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,181
和孩子们的生命安全?
and the lives of your children?

449
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:40,148
我觉得我完全有理由这么想
Well, I think it's a fairly compelling reason.

450
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,381
去年
Last year,

451
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,914
你的第二任丈夫 Walter Steel
Your second husband, Walter Steel,

452
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:48,415
被Merlyn先生绑架了 对吧?
was abducted by Mr. Merlyn, is that correct?

453
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:49,714
是 如你所言
Yes. So you say.

454
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:52,814
为什么Merlyn没杀Walter 却杀了你的第一任丈夫?
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter, the same as your first husband?

455
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:57,914
我说服了Malcolm 没让他那么干
I convinced Malcolm not to.

456
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,781
Malcolm听了你的话
And Malcolm listened to you.

457
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:04,248
你的朋友饶了Walter一命
Your friend spared Walter's life,

458
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:06,714
但是你现在却要让陪审团相信
And yet, you'd have this jury believing

459
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,415
你和你的孩子身处危险之中?
That you and your children were in danger?

460
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:09,814
之前确实是这样的 当时我非常害怕...
We were. I was afraid...

461
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:12,747
害怕被绳之以法
Afraid of getting caught.

462
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:17,315
先不说我可能犯了多少幼稚的错误
Despite whatever youthful mistakes I might have made,

463
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,514
Malcolm Merlyn都是一个危险人物
Malcolm Merlyn was a dangerous man.

464
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:21,948
那是对别人来说
To other people.

465
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:24,614
但真正对Moira Queen和她的家人
But the only person who truly posed a danger

466
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:26,981
造成威胁的人
to Moira Queen and her family

467
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,781
是Moira Queen
was Moira Queen.

468
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:54,281
- 嘿  - 如果你想打我 就动手吧
- Hey.  - Ok, if you want to attack me, go right ahead.

469
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:56,081
但你该知道 我还没对自己说的话
But you should know that you're not going to say anything

470
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:57,781
你不能对我说
that I haven't already said to myself.

471
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:00,781
哇哦 我知道那对你来说很困难
Whoa. I know that that was difficult for you,

472
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:03,148
我只是想确定你没事
And I just want to make sure that you're ok.

473
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:06,480
别 别碰我
No, no.

474
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,814
我不理解 在我刚刚那么做之后
I don't understand how you can forgive me

475
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,281
你还能原谅我
After what I just did in there.

476
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:14,847
我不理解谁会这么心胸宽广
I don't understand how anyone could.

477
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:23,348
所以 很明显
So, obviously you three

478
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,580
你们三个把回转石从洞里拿了出来
took the hosen out of this cave.

479
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,381
把他抬走
Lift him up.

480
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,181
我知道他没拿
Now I know he doesn't have it,

481
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:31,647
也就是说你们俩有一个人拿着
which means one of you two does.

482
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,514
交出来 再说交换的事
Give it to me, and we'll discuss an exchange.

483
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:36,014
我们不知道你在说什么
We don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:37,948
把Oliver放了
Give us Oliver,

485
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:40,181
随你们去找
and we'll leave you alone to look for it.

486
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,281
啊!
Aah!

487
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,348
谁还想做蠢事?
Anybody else want to be stupid?

488
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,048
嘿 嘿!
Hey. Hey!

489
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:48,381
好吧 把他们带走把
Fine. Take 'em.

490
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:51,014
给他松绑
Cut him loose.

491
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:55,914
你在干什么?!
What are you doing?!

492
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,948
不能停 他们就在身后!
We have to keep moving, they're following us!

493
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,014
很明显我们会继续跟进
Obviously we're continuing to monitor

494
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,781
今天这两件
both of these major stories

495
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:25,214
Starling市的重大新闻
in what has become a significant news day here in Starling.

496
00:27:25,214 --> 00:27:26,981
你能告诉我们关于...
What can you tell us about...

497
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,914
Oliver正为他母亲的事烦心
Oliver's going to be pretty wrapped up with his mother.

498
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,614
对于"伯爵"迷魂药如何进入人体
You making any process on how the Count's

499
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:33,148
你有什么进展吗?
getting vertigo into people's systems?

500
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,748
不多
Not much.

501
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:37,315
每个点代表一个脱瘾症状者的家
Each dot is the home of somebody with withdrawal symptoms.

502
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:38,948
看起来没什么规律啊
That seems pretty random.

503
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,781
确实是很随意的分布
That's because it's very random.

504
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:43,914
好吧
Ok.

505
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:46,948
如果人们不是在家里接触迷魂药
What if people weren't exposed at home;

506
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,881
而是在工作时候被下药的呢?
what if they got dosed at work?

507
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,614
你能通过工作地点来绘图吗?
Can you do this by their employment addresses?

508
00:27:51,614 --> 00:27:52,914
我真的很好奇
I'm really starting to wonder

509
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:54,814
那有什么好关注的
What it would take to impress you guys.

510
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,948
看起来像一条线路 一条通往城市的道路
It's a trail. A path through the city.

511
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:01,415
哪个地方你去过吗?
Any place you've been?

512
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,081
59街和戴尔街 我就是在那儿打的流感疫苗
59th and Dell, that's where I got my flu shot.

513
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,281
你从这些小摊接种疫苗 对吧?
You got your vaccination from one of those trucks, right?

514
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,747
那些只有流动卡车中的一个?
One of those roving flu trucks?

515
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:09,914
路线
The Route.

516
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:13,415
这是巡回接种疫苗 Starling市移动医疗站派出的一辆卡车
It's a flu vaccination tour. A truck sent out by Starling City mobile care.

517
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:16,281
一针之后就能让我上瘾? 这也行?
I got addicted after one injection? That can happen?

518
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:17,981
当然 有空的话可以试试海洛因
Sure. Try heroin some time.

519
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,914
不能试... 试吧
Not try... try.

520
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:21,315
好吧 现在卡车在哪儿?
All right, where's the truck now?

521
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:23,914
市中心 你想怎么做?
Downtown. What do you think?

522
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:25,881
打给Oliver?
Call Oliver?

523
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:28,647
不 不 他忙着家里的事呢 我去吧
No, no, he's busy with his family. I'll go.

524
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:30,914
嘿 不 不能让你去
Yeah, no. That's not happening.

525
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:32,148
我去吧
I'll go.

526
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:34,681
Felicity太危险了
Felicity, it's too dangerous.

527
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,148
没事 如果有事 我会给你打电话
It could turn out to be nothing. If it's not, I'll call.

528
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,315
法庭里上演的闹剧你不是刚看见了吗?
Courtroom drama you've just witnessed?

529
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,747
Bethany 没人想到法庭上的形势会急转直下
Bethany, no one expected the turn that testimony took.

530
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:45,681
Moira Queen和Malcolm Merlyn之间的私情
A revelation that Moira Queen once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn

531
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:49,614
成了大家关注的重点
became the sole focus of the prosecution's cross.

532
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:02,814
有人吗?
Hello?

533
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:08,415
有人在吗?
Anybody home?

534
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,048
迷魂药 可找到了
Vertigo. Got ya.

535
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:24,781
有趣吧 嗯?
Funny, eh?

536
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:27,579
你把我想说的话都说了
You took the word right out of my mouth

537
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,559
Thea啊?
Thea?

538
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:37,047
今天的审讯结束算是结束了吧?
Can we call it a night?

539
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:39,947
陪审团刚刚说他们可能要做出裁决
Jury just signaled that they could have a verdict.

540
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,914
法官不会让他们走的 他想今天结束
Judge will not send them home. He wants to get this over with.

541
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,514
糟透了
Line forms behind me.

542
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:46,815
这么快就裁决 不是好事吧?
A verdict that quickly is bad, isn't it?

543
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:51,081
你俩应该做最坏的打算
I think the two of you should prepare for the worst.

544
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:59,014
抱歉
Excuse me.

545
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,980
Felicity啊...
Felicity...

546
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,914
Oliver啊
Oliver.

547
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:06,581
这么叫没关系吧?
Is it ok if I call you Oliver?

548
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:09,614
听到我的声音很吃惊 对吧?
Surprised to hear from me, right?

549
00:30:09,614 --> 00:30:12,047
不过你应该没有我吃惊
Not as surprised as I was.

550
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:14,715
听着 我发现一个
You see, I find this

551
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:18,014
不怎么漂亮的金发在扰乱我的生意
not unattractive blonde getting all up in my business.

552
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:20,681
她戴着什么呢?
And what does she have on her?

553
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:23,914
Queen氏实业的工作证
A Queen Consolidated I.D. Badge.

554
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:28,147
这个名字怎么这么熟悉呢?
Now, I think to myself, why does that name ring a bell?

555
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:30,648
原来是Oliver Queen
Oliver Queen.

556
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,980
去年兜帽男把我投进监狱之前
He tried to buy off me last year,

557
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,314
他想收买我
just before the hood put me in a padded cell.

558
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:40,147
也就是你 绿箭侠
Ipso facto, Arrow.

559
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,314
你去哪儿?!
Where are you going?!

560
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:45,381
哦...
Oh...

561
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:47,748
办公室有点事情
Something's come up at the office.

562
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:49,980
Ollie 陪审团怎么办!
Ollie, the Jury!

563
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,548
我一定要去
I have to go.

564
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:24,147
奢侈豪华的办公楼
Pretty swanky offices.

565
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:28,014
从这儿就可以看到
You can see all the destruction that your mom caused

566
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:29,914
你妈妈搞的破坏
from up here.

567
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:32,314
你想怎样?
What do you want?

568
00:31:32,314 --> 00:31:34,815
世界和平 自我实现
World peace and personal satisfaction.

569
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:39,381
也不一定要按这个顺序走
Though not necessarily in that order.

570
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:43,448
你给我下毒 把我扔进洞里
You poisoned me and put me in a hole.

571
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:47,348
你无法想象 我有多恨你
You have no idea how much I hated you for that.

572
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:50,181
不过 有人跟我一样对你恨之入骨
Turns out, someone else hates you, too.

573
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:51,880
- 谁?  - 谁?
- Who?  - Who?

574
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,448
哦 等你知道了 一定会大吃一惊
Oh, you're going to be surprised when you find out.

575
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,847
他是个吝啬鬼
He's a man of means.

576
00:31:56,847 --> 00:32:00,114
给我重新安排了手术 让我引蛇出洞
Set me up with my new operation so I could draw you out.

577
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:02,081
- 做什么?  - 杀了你
- To do what?  - This.

578
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:08,715
你要再用点功夫了
You're going to have to try harder.

579
00:32:08,715 --> 00:32:11,081
没问题!
Done!

580
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:20,914
- 站起来!  - 啊!
- Come on!  - Ahh!

581
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:28,614
现在让我们执行计划B
So now we move on to plan B.

582
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,481
Oliver 别! 别为了我破戒!
Oliver, don't! Not for me!

583
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,815
安静 谢谢 我在威胁他
Quiet, please. I'm threatening.

584
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:36,980
放下你的箭
Lower your bow.

585
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,648
你和我之间的恩怨
Your problem is with me.

586
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:50,247
别牵扯到她
It's not with her.

587
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:52,348
把这当作是你逼我执行计划B
Well, then, consider this your penalty

588
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,980
所付出的代价吧
for making me go to plan B in the first place.

589
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:11,614
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

590
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,448
嘿 嘘 嘘
Hey, shh, shh.

591
00:33:13,448 --> 00:33:15,847
没事了
It's all right.

592
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,147
你安全了
You're safe.

593
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,481
哦 你中枪了
Oh, you were shot.

594
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:21,214
嘿
Hey.

595
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:23,715
没事的
It's nothing.

596
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:56,857
有什么进展么?
Any news?

597
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:59,014
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

598
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:01,148
有些事情...
Something...

599
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,981
刚在Queen氏实业发生了
happened at Queen Consolidated.

600
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:05,814
一会你在新闻上就会看见
You will see it on the news later.

601
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:07,581
别担心
Just don't worry about it.

602
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:10,348
要是陪审团宣判了怎么办?
What would you have done if there'd been a verdict?

603
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,114
Thea啊...
Thea...

604
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,780
我也不知道该怎么办
I don't know.

605
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,515
你还好吧?
Are you ok?

606
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,881
嘿
Hey.

607
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:20,515
陪审团回来了
Jury's back.

608
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:22,481
走吧
Come on.

609
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:27,814
我收到了陪审团的审判裁决书
I have received a note that the jury has arrived at a verdict.

610
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:32,714
请公布审判结果

611
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:37,014
Star城高级法院
In the superior court of Star County

被告人被判定无罪

无罪

618
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,581
妈妈
Mom.

619
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:21,448
我爱你们
I love you both so much.

620
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:36,181
判决结果令人震惊 就所有指控 Moira Queen被判无罪
A stunning result, as Moira Queen is acquitted of all charges.

621
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:40,481
今天的判决是本周最让人震惊的事件 也是法律的扭曲
In a day that's provided a week's worth of shocks and legal twists,

622
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:42,747
很多人认为该案已成定局
many had pronounced this case a done deal.

623
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:45,248
祝贺
Congratulations.

624
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:47,881
- 该祝贺吗?  - 她应该败诉
- Is that appropriate?  - She should have lost.

625
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:50,114
应该被判有罪
She should have been convicted.

626
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:53,381
你希望她被判有罪吗?
Did you want her to be?

627
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:55,714
我希望
I expected her to be.

628
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,747
陪审团的裁决没什么意义
Verdict doesn't make sense.

629
00:35:57,747 --> 00:35:59,615
不过 你妈妈一定很兴奋
Still, your mom must be thrilled. Beyond.

630
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,414
我觉得 更多的是震惊
It's more like shock, I think.

631
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:07,114
她正在办理手续 我来看看你的情况
They're processing her now. I just wanted to check in on you.

632

Queen实业应用科学部门

00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:43,414

抱歉
And I'm sorry.

645
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:48,881
抱歉什么?
For what?

646
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,615
我又一次惹上麻烦
I got myself into trouble again,

647
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:53,581
迫使你... 杀了他 
And you... killed him.

648
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:57,481
你又杀人了 很抱歉
You killed again, and I am sorry that I was the one

649
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,981
我让你进退两难 不得不做出这种决定
to put you in a position where you had to make that kind of choice.

650
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,248
Felicity啊...
Felicity...

651
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:05,981
他劫持你 并且想要伤害你
He had you, and he was going to hurt you.

652
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:11,348
我别无他选
There was no choice to make.

653
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:20,981
为什么这么做?!
Why did you do that?!

654
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:23,515
因为你从队长手上救了我的命 
Because you stopped the Captain from killing me.

655
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:25,515
谢谢你来救我
Thank you for coming.

656
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:27,548
Shado 他看起来状况很糟
Shado, he doesn't look too good.

657
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:30,014
- 他还好  - 这又是谁?
- He's not.  - Who's this?

658
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,214
一言难尽 他们要找的回转石
It's complicated. That hosen thing

659
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:34,914
还在飞机残骸上
they're looking for is back on the plane.

660
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:38,047
不 在我这里
No, I've got it.

661
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,148
它的一面上刻有佛经
It has a Buddhist inscription on one side.

662
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:41,881
让我想起了我父亲
It reminded me of my father.

663
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:44,714
我可以肯定 他们感兴趣的不是佛经
I'm pretty sure they aren't interested in Buddhism.

664
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:46,847
另一面是什么?
What's on the other side?

665
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,914
数字 30-30-175-12
30-30-175-12.

666

是坐标
Coordinates.

668
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,314
什么坐标?
To what?

669
00:37:57,314 --> 00:38:01,548
二战时期日本在此搁浅的潜艇的坐标
A Kairyu-class Japanese submarine which ran aground here during world war II.

670
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:04,414
这些人找一艘七十年前的潜艇干什么?
What do these guys want with a 70 year old sub?

671
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,747
潜艇不是重点 重要的是它运载的东西...
The sub isn't important, but what's on it...

672
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:10,448
它能够拯救人类
It'll save the human race.

673
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:13,248
能拯救他吗?
Will it save him?

674
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:26,181
你竟然没蠢死 祝贺啊
Well, you survived your own stupidity, congratulations.

675
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,881
你知道...
You know...

676
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,615
曾经我需要你
I needed you

677
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,581
帮我摆平岛上的
to deal with any resistance

678
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,680
一切烂摊子 不得不说
that I encountered on the island. I got to say,

679
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,114
你做的很差
You've done a fairly lousy job of that.

680
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,647
祝贺你
Congratulations.

681
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:45,581
你现在是新任队长
You're the new Captain.

682
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:52,581
我安排"伯爵"去除掉绿箭侠
I arranged for the count to take out the arrow,

683
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,448
结果呢
And all I accomplish is reigniting

684
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:56,747
只是燃起了他的杀人欲望
the vigilante's killing spree.

685
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:58,314
长官 有进展
Sir, there's been a development.

686
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:23,448
Cyrus兄弟...
Brother Cyrus...

687
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:26,615
感觉如何?
How do you feel?

688
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:31,314
更加强壮了
Stronger.

689
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:33,248
很好
Good.

690
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:37,214
你可以上场了
Then you're ready.

691
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:42,348
Queen夫人 摆脱谋杀的指控感觉如何?
Mrs. Queen, how does it feel to get away with murder?

692
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:44,981
到后边去 会有车接你
Once you go out back, there's a car waiting for you.

693
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:47,148
是你谋杀了自己的第一任丈夫吗?
Did you kill your first husband?

694
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:48,680
一直走就行
Just keep going.

695
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,548
显然Queen夫人很高兴陪审团认为
Obviously Mrs. Queen is overjoyed that the jury

696
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:54,581
她是在生命被威胁的情况下的无奈之举
has ruled that she was acting under terrible duress.

697
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:55,981
还有别的信息吗?
Can you give us anything else?

698
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:58,814
这边走 Queen夫人
This way, Mrs. Queen.

699
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,348
走高速公路能更快
The freeway will be quicker.

700
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,881
抱歉 Queen夫人
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.

702
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:25,181
还不能回去
Not yet.

703
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:38,314
这是什么地方?
Where are we?

704
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:40,181
我... 我没来过这里
I... I don't know this place.

705

先生 我把她带来了

706

你好 Moira
Hello, Moira.

707
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:55,348
你不是死了吗?!
They said you were dead!

708
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:57,114
死亡对于世界上的某些人来说只是假象
There are parts of the world where death is an illusion.

709
00:40:57,114 --> 00:40:58,515
我就是其中一员

我对此确信无疑

但是我回来 是因为你需要我的帮助

712
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,780
帮助?
Help?

713
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,714
帮助解决你的案子
With your trial.

714
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:12,581
你觉得没有外力协助 
You didn't think that jury acquitted you

715
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:13,914
陪审团会判你无罪吗?
without a little persuasion?

716
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:16,615
上帝啊
Dear god.

717
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:21,214
你到底想怎样 Malcolm?
What do you want, Malcolm?

718
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:25,581
我在Starling市还有一些关系

719
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:27,348
同盟

720
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:29,548
其中
Including one

721
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:31,981
有一位是检察官
in the D.A.'s office.

722
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:35,548
我带着极大兴趣关注Donner先生对你的调查
I followed Mr. Donner's investigation of you with interest.

723
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:37,714
这么多年来 你撒谎撒得那么随意
The ease with which you lied about us for years,

724
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:40,381
让我怀疑你是不是也有事瞒着我
it made me wonder whether you lied to me.

725
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:42,248
不 没有
No. No.

726
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:46,181
做个简单的基因测试
It was a matter of a simple surreptitious genetics test

727
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:49,014
- 就能轻松解决我的困惑  - 不
- to confirm my suspicion.  - Don't.

728
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:51,747
当知道Thea是我的女儿
Imagine my joy at learning that

729
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:55,148
你知道我有多兴奋吗?
Thea is my daughter.
