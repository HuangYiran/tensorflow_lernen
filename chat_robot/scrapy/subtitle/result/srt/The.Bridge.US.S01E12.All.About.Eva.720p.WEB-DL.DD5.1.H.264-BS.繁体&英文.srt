《邊橋謎案》前情提要
Previously on The Bridge...

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,850
我的天吶
Holy shit.

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,290
鮑勃  我一直對她有非分之想
Bob, I've been thinking about her in a special way.

4
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,950
下車吧
Here we go.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,300
你干什么  戴維
What are you doing, David?

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,800
退后  退后
Get back! Go back!

7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,180
他媽的到底搞什么
Wwhat the hell's going on?

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,050
炸彈已經激活  讓狙擊手待命
Bomb's live. Have your sniper stand down.

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,740
他已經激活了炸藥
He's activated the dead man's switch.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,450
只要你告訴兒子的下落  你想干什么都行
Do whateve you have to do and tell me where my son is!

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,460
拿出你的槍
Take out your gun.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,140
很好  現在瞄準他
Good. Now point it at him.

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,730
我跟你不一樣
I'm not like you.

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,020
你這樣救不了任何人
You're not saving anyone.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,980
丹尼爾
Daniel.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,640
我也許知道他在哪
I think I know where he is.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,830
格斯  馬克  不要開槍
Gus! Marco! Don't shoot.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,550
-桑婭  -我找到格斯了
- Sonya. - I found Gus.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,830
-她在說謊  -他還活著嗎
- She's lying. - Did you find him alive?

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,570
不
No.

21
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,390
上帝保佑你  史蒂文
Blessings, Steven.

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,010
-雞不錯啊  -是啊  她不肯下蛋
- Nice chicken. - Yeah, well, she won' lay,

23
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,650
我估計她吃了不少咖啡渣
and I'm... I'm thinking maybe she got into some coffee grounds.

24
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,060
你覺得她像吃過嗎
She seem caffeinated to you?

25
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,880
-她像只雞  -對啊
- Seems like a chicken. - Yeah.

26
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,200
什么風把你吹來了
What brings you here?

27
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,570
我得到了啟示
I've had revelation.

28
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,750
-說吧  -伊娃
- Tell it. - Eva.

29
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,650
我想娶她做我妻子
I want to make her my wife.

30
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,330
這有些突然
That's kind of sudden.

31
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,210
我打算向她求婚  如果她同意了
I'm gonna ask for her hand, and, uh, if she says yes,

32
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,540
那就由你來主持婚禮
then, uh, you're gonna perform the ceremony.

33
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,920
我深感榮幸  哥們  但是伊娃走了
I'm honored, brother. But Eva's gone.

34
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,600
她沒走
She can't be.

35
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,210
她走了
She is.

36
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,900
-什么時候的事  -一周前
- When? - Week.

37
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
她說她想靜一靜
Said she wanted off the path.

38
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,580
你該告訴我這事的
You could've told me about this.

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,840
我要找到她
I'm gonna find her.

40
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,720
運氣不好啊

41
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
是啊

42
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,460
你去哪

43
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,660
科洛涅阿斯

44
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,170
我能帶你去

45
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,420
不用了  謝謝

46
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,470
我去搭巴士

47
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,730
那好吧  請載我一程吧

48
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,620
車架彎曲  機體毀壞
The frame's bent, engine block's demolished.

49
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,070
這就是所謂的全損
This here's what we call a total loss.

50
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,300
我要你修好它
Well, I need it fixed.

51
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,840
我不知道從何下手
I wouldn't know where to start.

52
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,940
花多少錢我都認
I'll pay whatever it costs.

53
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,410
花更少的錢  你就能買到一輛新烈馬
You could buy a new Bronco for less.

54
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,670
我不想要新...
I don't want a new...!

55
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,480
我不想要新的烈馬  我就想要這輛
I don't want a new Bronco. I want this one.

56
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,930
女士  我耳朵很靈
Lady, I-I got good hearing.

57
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,110
這個技工簡直太沒用了
This mechanic' useless.

58
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,940
多年來我一直都在請他修車
Well, I've been using him for years.

59
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,230
他固執的要命
Well, he's very stubborn.

60
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,010
沒錯
He is.

61
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,160
他讓我扔了它
He wants me to junk it.

62
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,190
桑婭
Sonya...

63
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,880
這不過是她的車罷了  不是她
It was her car; it is not her.

64
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,580
無論如何  你趕快處理
In any case, could you wrap it up.

65
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,130
地檢那邊還等著呢
The D.A.'s waiting to prep me.

66
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,100
能不能取出那盤磁帶  它卡住了
Can you get the tape out? It stuck.

67
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,390
這沒問題
That I can do.

68
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,320
拜
Bye.

69
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,030
檢察官聯系不上馬可
Prosecutor can't get hold of Marco.

70
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,410
我也是
Yeah, me neither.

71
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,510
他必須要現身
We need him to show up.

72
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,890
我已經打了十一次電話了
Well, I've called him 11 times

73
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,970
他還沒打回來  所以...
and he hasn't called me back, so..

74
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,950
我想他了
I miss him.

75
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,980
這是好事
That's good.

76
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,010
是嗎
Is it?

77
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,090
是啊  你為什么不去見他呢
Yeah. Why don't you go see him?

78
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,410
他不會希望我去的
Don't think he'd lik that.

79
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,080
都已經...  已經一個月了
Well, it's been ov... it's been over a month.

80
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,660
大家不再聯系  探望  越來越孤單了
People stop calling, checking in, it gets pretty lonely.

81
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,660
我記得
I remember.

82
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,690
帶些點心去?
Bring pastries?

83
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,640
沒錯
There you go.

84
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,140
伊娃·格拉   見過她嗎

85
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,380
她在那家工廠上班

86
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,690
你認識她嗎

87
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
我見過她

88
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,170
我帶了好東西給你
Hi. I brought you these.

89
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,860
是這樣的  周五進行預審聽證
So, um.. the preliminary hearing' Friday.

90
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,730
地方檢察官需要你的證詞
The D.A. needs your testimony.

91
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,440
一直沒有你的消息
Haven't heard from you.

92
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,630
還以為會有一場葬禮
Thought there'd be a funeral.

93
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,610
沒有葬禮
No funeral.

94
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,220
你有沒有...  你最近...
Have you, um.. How have you..

95
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,050
我最近如何?  你想問這個嗎
How have I been? Is that your question?

96
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,450
要么爛醉  要么沉睡
I've been drunk. Or asleep.

97
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,320
好吧  阿爾瑪呢
Right. And Alma?

98
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,880
阿爾瑪走了
Alma is gone.

99
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,840
她去哪里了
Oh, where'd she go?

100
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,900
不知道啊  我說她走了
I don't dnow. She's gone, I said.

101
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,210
你還不明白嗎

102
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,960
我的幾個女兒也走了  格斯也死了
And my daughters are gone and Gus is gone!

103
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,980
正常人都知道這些吧
A normal person would know that!

104
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,890
而且  大家都知道不該打電話給我
A-A-And they would know not to call me,

105
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,730
不該敲我門  不該來我家
not to knock door, not to come to my house!

106
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,230
我是想看看你情況如何
Well, I wanted to check on you.

107
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,650
為什么  我們又不熟
Why? You don't know me.

108
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,340
我們曾是搭檔啊
Well, we... we were partners.

109
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,800
不不不  別誤會了
No, no, no, no, no.. Don't misunderstand things.

110
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,760
你我不過是
You and I are just two people

111
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,570
合作辦案罷了
who worked together on a case.

112
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,230
僅此而已
Huh? Nothing more.

113
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,620
看他們蕩秋千的樣子

114
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,280
好像猴子

115
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,590
我想把這個還你
I wanted to give this back to you.

116
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
我偷的
I stole it.

117
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,790
她是說真的嗎

118
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,420
我以為被你那亞洲兄弟拿走了

119
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,570
你是我所見過的最差勁的會計

120
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,600
我是來找新搭檔的
I'm looking for new partner.

121
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,930
我這個人沒有搭檔  只有員工
I don't have partners. I have employees.

122
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,300
我有隧道
And I have a tunnel.

123
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,400
你之前從里面運過一具尸體  沒收你錢
You hauled a corpse through it once... for free.

124
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,150
-那你把賬單給我  -我請了
- Send me the bill. - It's on the house.

125
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,840
-你需要一個我這樣的人  -是嗎
- You need someone like me. - Ah, si?

126
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,440
-為什么  -我是白人  還是美國公民
- Why? - I'm white, I'm a citizen.

127
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
在美國沒人注意我  你不行
I blend in over there. You don't.

128
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,370
你想做我在埃爾帕索的合伙人
So you'll be my man in El Paso.

129
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,460
百分之十五分成
For 15%.

130
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,080
你太瘦了  需要吃份牛排了
You're too skinny. You need una steak.

131
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,300
我們找個晚上去吃飯吧
We'll go to dinner one night.

132
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,710
這么說是有的談了
Does that mean we have a deal?

133
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,630
每周五公斤貨  我們見面
Five kilos per week. We meet,

134
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,710
然后我付給你錢
I pay you entonces.

135
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,720
順便還可以了解彼此
We get to know each other.

136
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,550
我沒問題
I can do that.

137
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,060
-我對人一向友好  -知道了
- I'm a nice guy, you know. - Okay.

138
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,300
上次我殺的那個人  我很友好地把他的雞雞
Last man I killed, I was nice enough to cut his dick,

139
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,880
蛋蛋  還有嘴唇割下來送給他妻子了
balls, and lips off and send to his wife.

140
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,440
我不想讓她一個人孤單
Didn't want her to get lonely.

141
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,840
克羅斯警探  
Detective Cross.

142
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,880
你還記得我嗎
You remember me?

143
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,520
-斯蒂文·林德  -對
- Steven Linder. - That's right.

144
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,940
-最近好嗎  -還行
- How are you? - Fine.

145
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,380
有什么事嗎
What are you doing here?

146
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,950
我的新娘不見了
Well... my bride is missing.

147
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,680
她在華瑞茲的一家工廠工作
She was working at a factory in Juarez.

148
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,380
有人上次見到她是三天前
Last seen three days ago.

149
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,030
你跟她家人聯系過嗎
Have you talked to her family?

150
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,420
-她沒有家人  -朋友呢
- No family. - Hmm, friends?

151
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,290
她自己一個人生活  
She's what you call uh, alone in life.

152
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,700
這不是還有你
Except for you.

153
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,280
我叫她新娘時是口誤了
I misspoke when I called her my bride.

154
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,420
其實我是一廂情愿的
She's, uh, more like my intended.

155
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,950
斯蒂文  你是邊橋案件的嫌疑人
Steven, you were a person of interest in the Bridge case.

156
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,250
我知道
I am aware.

157
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,770
我在你的拖車邊上發現了燒過的女人衣服
I found burned women's clothes up at your trailer.

158
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,020
我怎么知道你有沒有殺這個女孩
How do I know you didn't take this girl?

159
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,820
-我不是這種人  -你是什么人
- That's not who I am. - Who are you?

160
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,240
-我幫助別人  -我記得你說過
- I help people. - I remember you saying that.

161
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,730
幫助那些受到野蠻丈夫或伴侶之類
Women who are being abused by a violent husband,

162
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,260
虐待的女人
partner, or what have you.

163
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,600
她們都是怎么找到你的
How do they find you?

164
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,150
我因為做這種事在圈子里小有名氣
I've become kind of known for this sort of work.

165
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,030
你把人帶到這里來
You bring them here?

166
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,730
我這里有藥品  營養食品
I have medical supplies, nutritious food,

167
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,880
水  在這里休息也很安全
water... safe place to rest.

168
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,380
你可以看看里面
You, you can look inside.

169
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,850
請你退后
Stand back, please.

170
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,690
我燒掉她們的東西是怕別人找到她們
I burn their things so they can't be tracked.

171
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,910
然后她們去哪里 
Where do they go next?

172
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,160
一個安全的地方
A safe house.

173
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,980
-你為什么做這個  -因為我有這個能力
- Why do you do it? - 'Cause I can.

174
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,660
這種事非同尋常啊  斯蒂文
That's pretty unusual, Steven.

175
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,640
-對  但不違法吧  -不違法
- Yeah, but not illegal. - No, no.

176
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,920
你為什么將伊娃稱為新娘呢
Why did you call Eva you bride when she wasn't?

177
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,680
因為我認定她了
Because I am bound to her.

178
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,610
她也這么想嗎
Does she feel the same way?

179
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,690
這你得問她
You have to ask her.

180
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,310
她有可能只是回男友那去了嗎
So is there any chance she just went back to her boyfriend?

181
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,790
不太可能
No, not really, nope.

182
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,590
我會一直尋找她  直到找到為止
I'll keep looking for her. Tirelessly, until I find her.

183
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,790
但...  執法部門或許能幫我
But I think... law enforcement would be helpful.

184
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,490
我并不是華瑞茲的警察
I'm not a Juarez cop.

185
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,130
帶走她的車上掛著德州的牌照
Well, the car that picked her up had Texas plates.

186
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,270
你會幫我找到她嗎
Will you help me find her?

187
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,530
陽光照射的感覺真好
Doesn't the sun feel nice?

188
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,060
是啊  要是你想得皮膚癌的話
Yeah, if you're into skin cancer.

189
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,510
這兒空氣真清新  一點也不夸張
Fresh air. It's not overrated.

190
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,810
感覺自己像個80歲的老人一樣
I feel lik I'm 80 years old.

191
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,160
因為你一直像病人一樣生活
Cause you're living like an invalid.

192
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,590
哎呀  真不巧我是個病人
Uh, hello I am an invalid.

193
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,040
但你得自己轉輪椅了
You're ready t wheel yourself.

194
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,970
-什么  -你得學會用這個
- What? - You need to learn how to use this.

195
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,510
這只是暫時的而已
It's only temporary.

196
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,870
那這段時間誰會幫你推呢  反正不是我
Well, who's gonna push you around in the meantime? Not me.

197
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,110
我感覺好差
I feel shitty.

198
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,180
這里氣氛不太好  你還是回來工作吧
It's depression here, you got to come back to work.

199
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,330
你知道我越過大橋時心里在想什么
You know what I was thinking when I was sailing over that bridge?

200
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,490
你問我  我問誰去
Check me out, I' superman.

201
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,760
別讓我死  我想活著
Don't let me die. I want to live.

202
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,110
-你的確活下來了  -但為了什么呢
- And you did. - Yeah, but for what?

203
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,770
生命太短  但我已經浪費了很多時光
Life is short, and I've already wasted so much of mine.

204
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,600
順便說句  你可別學這樣
I don't recommend it by the way.

205
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,140
遵命  尤達宗師
Okay, Yoda.

206
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,020
尤達  《星球大戰》中人物

207
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,000
我親眼看到你摔下來  
I saw you fall, Daniel.

208
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,600
丹尼爾  太可怕了
It was scary as shit.

209
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,190
從我的視角看也挺嚇人的
It was pretty scary from my point of view, too.

210
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,300
你還活著我真是太高興了
I'm really gla you're alive.

211
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,480
你愛我  你只想懷我的孩子
You love me. You just want to have my babies.

212
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,980
-病房里見吧  -等等
- See you back there. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

213
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,800
我看玩笑呢
I was... I was kidding.

214
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,350
別就那樣走了
Hey, don't just walk away.

215
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,930
我只有一只胳膊
I... Hey, I only got one arm.

216
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,680
她在華瑞茲失蹤的
She disappeared in Juarez.

217
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,910
-車掛著美國的車牌  -還掛著
- The car had American plates. - Still?

218
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,790
她在工廠工作
She worked in factory,

219
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,370
很多廠主都住在埃爾帕索
and a lot of those managers live in El Paso.

220
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,440
-那在華瑞茲還需要人手  -我知道
- Well, we're gonna nee somebody in Juarez. - I know.

221
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
他跟你說別再打擾他
He told you to leave him be.

222
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,670
他很在意這事  
He'd care about this.

223
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,570
而且他也需要回來工作
And he really needs to get back to work.

224
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,670
好吧  祝他好運
Well, then... Well, good luck.

225
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,700
開修理廠的車感覺怎么樣
How're you getting on with the motor pool car?

226
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,190
沒有卡帶錄放機
It doesn't have tape deck.

227
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,920
多謝
Thank you.

228
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,540
卡門一直在問你什么時候能去做客
Carmen keeps asking when you're gonna come on up to the house.

229
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,410
-快了  -我們等著你來
- Soon. - We're gonna hold you to that.

230
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,930
-好夢  -晚安
- Nighty night. - Night.

231
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,770
請往這邊走

232
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,320
沒事  我不想做筆錄了

233
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,240
你在醫院里說他把你鎖起來了

234
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,030
這是很要緊的事

235
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,720
這邊走

236
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,730
在這里

237
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,780
在這里

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,470
是啊  就在這里

239
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,140
只是待一會兒

240
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,000
別緊張

241
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,620
馬可  我需要你幫忙
Marco. I need your help.

242
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,480
麻煩把這個女人請出去

243
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,160
這個姑娘  伊娃·格拉
There's this girl, Eva Guerra...

244
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,040
她是危險分子  曾開槍打我

245
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,870
她已經失蹤三天了
She's been missing for three days.

246
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,870
一個在華瑞茲失蹤的姑娘
A missing girl in Juarez.

247
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,530
上帝啊  看啊  馬可...
Oh, my God. Look, Marco..

248
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,610
我這兒有個小杯子  我們用它海底撈針吧
I have this little glass here. Let's empty the ocean with it.

249
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,510
我知道你是在意這些失蹤女孩的  我知道
I know you care abou those girls. I know you do.

250
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,550
我要去衛生間了  你可不能跟著我了
Just gonna go to the only place you cannot follow me.

251
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,370
好了  現在該帶你回家了
All right. Taking you home.

252
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,500
來人幫個忙

253
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,980
好了  起來  起來

謝謝  行了
Gracias. Okay.

255
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,950
現在走吧
Now...

256
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,310
-你沒有孩子  -是
- You don't have children. - No

257
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,620
所以你沒法理解那種...
So you don't understand, then, that..

258
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,680
是啊  你理解不了
Of course you don't.

259
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,690
你不理解的事太多了
You don't understand a lot of things.

260
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,790
-如果你非開槍不可  -小聲點
- If-if-if you had to shoot me.. - Keep your voice down.

261
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,190
你就該直接殺了我
...you should have killed me!

262
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,060
-什么  -他是我的兒子啊
- What. - He was my kid!

263
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,430
他死了  我也就死了
He goes, I go!

264
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,380
-鄰居都睡覺呢  -他們為什么能睡得著
- People are sleeping. - Why are they sleeping?

265
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,090
因為現在已經凌晨三點了
Because it's 3:00 in the morning.

266
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,340
可我的孩子不在了  永遠不在了
And my son is gone. Forever gone.

267
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,390
我的孩子被殺害  你們怎么能睡得著

268
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,100
-鑰匙呢  -鑰匙...

00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,360
-你該走了  走啊   -不要
- You gotta go, I said go! - No.  I said no.

272
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,910
我要留下
I am staying

273
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,300
你以為你是誰啊
Who do you think you are?

274
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,980
我沒什么朋友  馬可
I don't find people very often, Marco.

275
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,610
那是自然  你怎么可能交到朋友

276
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,740
你不是這么想的
You don't think that.

277
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,680
-無所謂了  -但你是在乎的  馬可
- I don't care . - But... you care, Marco.

278
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,040
我知道你是在乎的
I know you care.

279
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,280
這就是我想說的
That's what I mean.

280
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,700
所以別再說我不是你的搭檔了  好嗎
So don't tell me you're not my partner. Okay?

281
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,650
也不要趕我走
And don't send me away.

282
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,200
因為我沒有別的朋友了
'Cause I don't.. I don't have another one.

283
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,830
-好了  -這里
- All right. - In here.

284
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,760
好了
All right.

285
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,440
-他的氣息還在  -喝點水
- I still can smell him. - Drink this.

286
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,740
抱歉
Sorry.

287
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,150
-格斯有點喜歡你  -我知道
- Gus had a crush on you. - Yeah.

288
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,810
-你知道  -他曾送給我巧克力
- You knew that? - He bought me chocolates.

289
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,150
-我都不知道  -我說  如果我們約會
- I didn't know that. - I told him you wouldn't like that

290
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,180
-你會不高興的  -是啊  我肯定不高興
- if we dated. - Nope, I would not.

291
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,750
他是個好孩子
He was a sweet boy.

292
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,960
是啊
He was.

293
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,400
好了  躺好
Okay. Here we go.

294
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,500
我總是忍不住要想他
Can't stop thinking about him.

295
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,330
-我知道  -我是說戴維
- I know - David, I mean.

296
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,920
為什么他能活下來

297
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,200
為什么他能活下來
Why does he get to live?

298
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,430
早上好
Good morning.

299
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,300
你在這里過夜的嗎
You stayed?

300
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,610
你不記得了嗎
You don't remember?

301
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,920
我母親每次宿醉之后的早上
My mom always liked eggs in the morning

302
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,330
都喜歡吃雞蛋
after a rough night.

303
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,600
謝謝你
Thank you.

304
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,370
你整理床鋪了嗎
Did you make your bed?

305
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,760
你難道是我老媽不成
What are you, my mother?

306
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,790
當我姐姐去世時
When my sister died...

307
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,900
我在漢克和他妻子家住了一陣
I stayed with Hank and his wife for a while.

308
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
卡門給我訂了一條規矩
Carmen had one rule for me.

309
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,680
按時起床并整理好床鋪
Always get up and make your bed.

310
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,510
不管我有多難過
No matter how bad I felt.

311
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,330
日子總要過下去的
I had to face the day.

312
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,670
我今天會去警察局一趟  問候大家
I think I'll go into the station today. Say hello.

313
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,740
我能一起去嗎
Can I come?

314
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,310
你想調查那個女孩的資料
You want to run the girl's name?

315
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,550
是的  拜托了
Yes, please.

316
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,090
好吧
Okay.

317
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,240
看吧  我還是記得點什么的
See, I remember some things.

318
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,290
你認得她嗎

319
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,260
她失蹤了嗎

320
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,180
是的

321
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,260
我告訴你哪里可以找到她們

322
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,710
真高興見到你  你還好嗎

323
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,700
馬可  我的朋友

324
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,800
你收到了帕洛瑪做的食物嗎

325
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,400
是的很美味  幫我謝謝她

326
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,570
也謝謝你  西莉亞

327
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,510
應該的

328
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,640
我可以再做一些

329
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,330
什么風把你吹來了
And what brings you here?

330
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,340
我們的合作不是已經結束了嗎
I thought our work is done?

331
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,350
我在找一個最后出現在華瑞茲的失蹤女孩
Looking for a missing girl. Last seen in Juarez.

332
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,160
我想我們可以查一下她的資料
Uh, I said we could run her name.

333
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,410
那當然
Of course.

334
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,100
她的名字是伊娃·格拉   今年23歲
Her name is Eva Guerra, 23 years old.

335
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,060
你回來上班了嗎

336
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,000
暫時還沒有

337
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,660
慢慢來  不著急

338
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,490
真可惜戴維·泰特被美國人收押了

339
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,450
他殺了一個警察的兒子

340
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,870
要在我們這一定得讓他血債血償

341
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,660
以牙還牙

342
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,540
我知道

343
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,710
找到什么了嗎
Anything?

344
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,880
找不到她的記錄
No record of her.

345
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,750
沒有人符合她的描述
No one matches her description.

346
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,430
真抱歉
So sorry.

347
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
我們先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse us.

348
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,970
我真的一口都吃不下了
I honestly cannot eat another bite.

349
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,160
這比醫院的食物美味太多了
So much better than hospital food.

350
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,370
不喝點啤酒嗎
No beer for you?

351
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,630
不用了
Um... no.

352
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,090
要是有背部按摩我倒不介意
A back rub would be great, though.

353
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,380
你那命根子還能用嗎
So does everything still work down there?

354
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,630
-埃琳娜  -怎么了
- Elena! - What?

355
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,620
只是個問題而已
It's just a question.

356
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,000
我的男性雄風沒有問題  謝謝關心
My mighty twig and my berries are fine, thank you.

357
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,180
你可不想嫁給一個坐輪椅的男人

358
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,620
是的我不想

359
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,700
你的余生都要推著他到處走

360
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,210
你需要一個能照顧你的男人

361
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,160
她在說什么  在談論我嗎
Hey, what's she saying? She's talking about me, huh?

362
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,360
她不想艾德里安娜嫁給你
She doesn't think Adriana should marry you.

363
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,170
是啊  你再說一遍試試
Yeah, you can say that again.

364
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,090
我不想結婚  媽媽

365
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,790
別說這種話

366
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,220
我不會結婚的  你是知道的

367
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,840
夠了

368
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,350
什么夠了

369
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,020
注意你的言辭

370
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,590
別在丹妮拉面前說這種話

371
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,190
我不想你教她這些

372
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,780
不  這比保護她強多了

373
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,850
你們沒必要保護我

374
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,790
你把陰道稱為花

375
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,590
陰道

376
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,740
就是它的叫法才讓我擔心

377
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,530
好了  這是一個平靜的家庭之夜
Nice, calm evening at home, huh.

378
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,580
這是一個荒唐的家庭  我已經煩透了
This is the crazy house.I'm so sick of it.

379
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,210
這是你的毛病

380
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,310
我希望你去教堂問問神父

381
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,450
我幫家里負擔費用的時候

382
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,760
可沒聽你抱怨我的毛病

383
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,440
為什么你們要發這么大的火呢

384
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,910
也許我們可以去
Hey, you know, maybe we could go,

385
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,810
吃冰淇淋或是什么的
like, get some ice cream or something

386
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,310
因為我是同性戀
We can't Because I date women.

387
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,880
我是這個家族的恥辱
I'm an embarrassment to the family.

388
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,400
滾出去

389
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,020
非常樂意

390
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,990
糟糕
Oh, shit.

391
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,720
你們這邊的口利左香腸不錯
There's something about the chorizo on your side.

392
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,880
你經常在華瑞茲吃早餐嗎
You start your mornings in Juarez often?

393
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,550
我認為這可能是最好的機會
I figured I had the best chance of you,

394
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,480
向你展示
showing u.....

395
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,290
所以呢
So?

396
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,010
所以我只是想和你談談
So I wanted to talk that's all.

397
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,680
我估計你今天可能不會去法庭
Occurred to me you might not be at court today.

398
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,600
我還沒有決定
I haven't decided yet.

399
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,850
可你起來了  穿戴整齊  剃了胡子
Well, you're up,you're dressed, you're shaved.

400
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,700
那是個好兆頭
That's a good sign.

401
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,120
現在能安下心了嗎
You're able to find any peace?

402
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,740
一天中只有那么十秒鐘
Ten seconds a day.

403
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,390
你不該如此
That ain't right.

404
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,700
當我早晨睜開雙眼的時候
When I open my eyes in the morning...

405
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,430
有那么十秒鐘
For ten seconds,

406
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,100
我不記得他已經死了
I don't remember he's gone.

407
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,850
這就是我現在的生活
That this is my life now.

408
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,490
你希望法律來制裁戴維·泰特嗎
Can you let the system take care of David Tate?

409
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,480
這樣你才能讓自己釋懷
So you can take care of yourself?

410
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,910
我不知道
I don't know.

411
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,000
無論有沒有你指證  他都會進監獄
Well, he's gonna go to prison with or without you testified.

412
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
這些都不重要  不是嗎
Then it doesn't matter, does it?

413
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,590
但如果你說出來
But if you say it.

414
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,050
我也會說  桑婭也會說的
And I'm gonna say it Sonya's gonna say it

415
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,400
但如果你說出來
But if you say it...

416
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,420
你可能就會好受點
you just maybe might leave it there a little bit.

417
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,770
也許會  也許不會
Maybe. Maybe not.

418
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,040
像猜謎游戲  是吧
It's all a guessing game, isn't it?

419
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,350
也許你明早上起床時會增加一秒
But just saying that you might get yourself

420
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,060
不難受的時間
another second in the morning.

421
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,490
你現在住哪

422
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,480
埃爾帕索

423
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,810
和誰

424
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,130
你真想知道嗎

425
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,700
你現在怎么不用去上班

426
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,830
我上晚班  相當于升職了

427
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,120
你還想上學嗎

428
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,330
我沒你那么聰明

429
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,280
你沒回答我的問題

430
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,810
新來了個經理

431
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,770
人很好

432
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,430
很可愛

433
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
可愛

434
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,530
別擔心  他都快三十了

435
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,410
他很友好  不像其他人

436
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,350
請給我四個牛肉餅

437
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,790
媽媽呢

438
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,860
她說你可以回來

439
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,620
只要你改變

440
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,210
或許可以去教堂讓上帝幫助你

441
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,850
丹妮拉  這個和上帝沒關系

442
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,310
謝謝
Gracias.

443
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,630
你來了
You came.

444
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,030
是啊  我來了
Yeah, I came.

445
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,770
做得對
Good for you.

446
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,420
謝謝
Thank you.

447
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,220
西莉亞

448
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
出什么事了

449
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,140
我受不了了

450
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,710
進來說

451
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,620
請坐

452
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,390
我再也不能默不作聲

453
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,790
冷眼旁觀

454
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,230
我受不了了

455
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:29,420
我明白

456
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,720
但請冷靜下來

457
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,940
你要小心處理你知道的事情

458
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,220
你知道薩帕塔吧

459
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,220
埃米利亞諾·薩帕塔  墨西哥革命領袖  民族英雄

460
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,700
"寧可站著死  也不跪著活"

461
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,220
告訴我  發生什么事了

462
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,840
我看到了一些情況

463
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,320
你看到什么了

464
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,270
你們找的那個女孩  伊娃

465
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,530
我看到她在警察局

466
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,310
什么時候

467
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,800
昨天

468
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,650
一個警察把她帶走了

469
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,310
好吧
OK.

470
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,710
我們得幫助她

471
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,250
交給我吧  好嗎

472
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,740
好吧
Okay.
