1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,100
Mickey Mantle had this much water
pressure,he'd have hit 60 before Maris.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,950
After that,all you can talk
about is baseball and plumbing?

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,740
Oh,this game's going extra innings.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,400
- You think you can knock it out of the park?
- Oh,I know I can.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,630
- Oh,yeah?
- Oh,yeah.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,890
- You okay?
- Yeah,that was weird.I just got a chill.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,850
Did you get your flu
shot?There's a bug going around.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,450
I haven't been sick since 1996.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,610
Now,come on,I'm up to bat,and you
- You feel hot.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,910
You look hot.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,080
Well,this game's rained
out.I'm taking your temperature.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,340
Oh,honey.No,please,come on.We
can play through this.All right?

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,490
Come on,batter up.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,590
Open up.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,950
Colony collapse,Neal.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,300
That's what we're dealing with here.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,360
Apis mellifera are dying off
in terrifying proportions.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,770
Timmy Nolan Park.

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,550
People for the awareness of near earth
objects,and now the plight of the honeybees.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,700
Our nation's agriculture
depends on these drones.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,930
Without pollination,there's no strawberries,no almonds
- No grapes?

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,940
Is this about wine?

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,140
Maybe.You have room for three hives.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,810
That's three more beehives
than I want on my terrace.

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,660
I mean,is beekeeping
even legal in New York?

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,130
Across all five boroughs.I
mean,where's the danger?

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,370
Swarms spring to mind.

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,720
Although a hive would be a
decent hiding spot for contraband.

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,200
And an excellent business opportunity.

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,340
Pollen,propolis,and honey have been known for
their healing properties since Ancient Greece.

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,170
And Cleopatra bathed in milk and honey,and,take
it from me,what it did for my undercarriage...

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,680
Okay.Start with one hive.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,220
See you later.

34
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,230
Probably just allergies.All those
trees dropping pollen everywhere.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,890
I do love how leafy
this neighborhood is.

36
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,080
What is Neal doing here?

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,150
Does he have a tracker on you?

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,390
Told him I was walking you to work.

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,480
- Morning,Peter.
- Morning.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,430
- Elizabeth.
- Morning.

41
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,560
Want me to carry that for you?

42
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,010
- You're casing her art.
- What?

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,220
You're casing my art?

44
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,700
Please.You guys qualify for
the friends and family plan.

45
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,910
I don't know what that means.

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,640
Speaking of families...

47
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,590
Oh,yeah,that's unbelievable.Figure
your kid's dead...

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,240
Then after 15 years,Patrick
shows up at the front door.

49
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,130
How does a 14-year-old evade
an international manhunt?

50
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,190
When was the last time you saw him?

51
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,890
The summer before my junior year.

52
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,900
Oh,I fell in love with Europe.

53
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,880
We were going to museums in every city,and it
was one of the best tutoring jobs I ever had.

54
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,200
But then he ran away from boarding school in
Switzerland,and I never heard from him again.

55
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,310
Must be nice to have a father who
welcomes you home with old masters.

56
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,760
He wanted a lot of new pieces
before the homecoming party.

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,440
Oh,well,it will be nice to see him and
William,and,wow,Bea was just a baby.

58
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,670
And of course Stanton.

59
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,430
- Who's Stanton?
- The butler.

60
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,230
He was kind of the glue that
kept the family together.

61
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,620
Just one butler?Very
frugal for gazillionaires.

62
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,080
Okay,I'm leaving.Hey,by the way,I'm
gonna be putting alarms on the art.

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,810
- No.
- Just one.

64
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,350
What's going on?You sick?

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,850
Come on.The Mortensen Real Estate
scandal's not gonna solve itself.

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,970
I wish it would.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,570
Mrs.Burke.Do come in.

68
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,470
Stanton,you still can call me Elizabeth.

69
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,390
Unfortunately,I cannot.

70
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,050
Good day.

71
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,930
Dad,you can't fire him.

72
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,540
I'm telling you it's a
violation of labor rights.

73
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,370
Bea,when you have graduated from Harvard
Law,we'll continue this conversation.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,900
But Stanton didn't do it.

75
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,430
- Elizabeth.
- William.Is this a good time?

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,730
Of course.This is my daughter Bea.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,380
I met you when you were a baby.

78
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,690
Mm,I've heard the stories.

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,980
And I'm not going to law school.

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,190
Elizabeth,my apologies.

81
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,040
Bea spends so much time
with her head stuck in novels

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,970
that the realities of
life are all the harsher.

83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,060
Is it true about Stanton?What happened?

84
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,390
He leaked the truth about
my health to the press.

85
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,380
It was damaging to my business
and a personal betrayal.

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,030
I'm really sorry to
hear that.How are you?

87
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,490
Well,blood sugar spikes like the
market,ticker's on Mile 24,but screw the doctors.

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,040
Now that Patrick's home,I
feel like I'm 40 again.

89
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,550
And?How is he?

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,760
Well,he's Patrick.

91
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,730
As you know,art was the
only thing we had in common,

92
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,650
and I'm still hoping
that's a way we can connect.

93
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,140
Liz Mitchell.I'm coming in.

94
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,990
Patrick?You're taller.

95
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,100
And lost the blue hair.

96
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,520
I like this better.

97
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,590
You are as beautiful as ever.

98
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,020
Yeah,that got us kicked out
of the Accademia in Florence.

99
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,500
Wow,you still have your scar too.

100
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,870
What was that name of the horse again?

101
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,930
- Cheval Chase.
- Yes.

102
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,530
Threw me clear over
the fence at Stony Hill.

103
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,370
Mm,and that was the first
time I thought I'd lost you.

104
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,810
- I'm gonna go check on Bea.
- Okay.

105
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,060
All right,kid,I've
got a lot of questions.

106
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,540
After mom died,I begged dad to let
me stay in the city with him and Bea.

107
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,910
I was so sad about your mom.

108
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,670
Dad wanted me to go to Le
Rosey.But I wasn't ready.

109
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,260
- Is that why you ran?
- I was tired of living on his terms.

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,300
You were just a kid.How did you do it?

111
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Saved my allowance.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,980
On a ski day,I snowboarded
from Zermatt to Cervinia,

113
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,290
sold my gear,hopped on a
train,and never looked back.

114
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,350
You put your family through hell.

115
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,480
What made you come back?

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Dad.Rumors that he was sick
were all over the papers.

117
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,350
I came back for him,not for this life.

118
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,380
He's trying.

119
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,960
By buying me art?

120
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,520
- It's his way of bonding.Let him.
- Okay.

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,790
Well,I remember your tastes.

122
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,490
We have Dutch masters,baroque,abstract
expressionists.

123
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,990
That one.The Picasso.

124
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,880
The Homme Au Cornet?

125
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,770
I put this in as a joke.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,040
Do you remember the Reina Sofia?

127
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,540
You called Guernica a bastard
child of cubist-surrealist mentovem

128
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,700
and accused Picasso of
crimes against beauty.

129
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,980
I was a kid.Tastes change.

130
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,420
- You sure?
- Yeah.I love it.

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,700
Well,I'll have the gallery send it over.

132
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,460
Elizabeth.How's Downton Abbey?

133
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,480
I know this is gonna sound weird,but I don't
think Patrick Wolcott is Patrick Wolcott.

134
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,750
It's his eyes.They're the right
color,but it doesn't feel like him.

135
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,870
- You think he's an imposter?
- So it's possible.

136
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,870
Yeah,missing rich kids are a subset.

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,560
You got your Patty Hearsts,your
John Paul Gettys,talented Mr.Ripleys.

138
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,980
William Wolcott is a perfect mark.

139
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,570
A very sick,emotionally fragile mark.

140
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,160
Will you look into it?

141
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,140
Yeah.I have to run it by Peter,but...

142
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,800
- How he's holding up?
- I will find out.

143
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,850
How are you feeling?

144
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,390
Tip-top.Million bucks.

145
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,740
Even if he is a ringer,you're telling me
William Wolcott wouldn't know his own son?

146
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,940
Emotion is a con man's sweet spot.

147
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,670
And I have good reason to believe
that that is not the real Patrick.

148
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,590
- Better be good.
- It is.

149
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,190
- Better be damn good.
- It is.

150
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,920
Does your wife's intuition count?

151
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,940
El called you?

152
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,080
I did say you guys were on
the friends and family plan.

153
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,940
Is this some elaborate ruse
to avoid the Mortensen case?

154
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Okay,that hurts my feelings,because we're
looking at potential identity theft,fraud.

155
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,670
A family's fortune is at stake,not
to mention the charitable foundation.

156
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,470
- Based on what?
- Pablo Picasso.

157
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Kid hated his work,and now he's
pushing Elizabeth to buy one.

158
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,690
You want me to launch into an
investigation based on a Picasso snafu?

159
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,860
Peter,this is like you
suddenly becoming a Red Sox fan.

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,080
- I'd have to be...
- I'm...you'd have to what?

161
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,470
- I'd have to be a different person.
- Thank you.

162
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,680
- It's hot in here.
- Yeah,you really don't look good.You should go home.

163
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,060
I'm not going home.I'm not
sick.I've never gone home sick.

164
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,120
You're gonna have to
give me more than Picasso.

165
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,860
Also suspicious...Mr.Wolcott
fired his butler of over 30 years.

166
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,620
- Good help is hard to find.
- Or he was set up.

167
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,670
The smart move is to jettison anyone
who intimately knew the real Patrick.

168
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,420
- We'd need a DNA test.
- His father hasn't ordered one.

169
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,670
But Elizabeth could grab a
hair when she's over there.

170
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,110
Okay,I'm not sending my
wife in as a secret agent.

171
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,410
- So send me in.
- How?

172
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,530
The Wolcotts need a
new butler.I can buttle.

173
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,700
- Buttle?
- Yeah,it's a verb.

174
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,760
Neal Caffrey at your service.

175

178
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,350
I don't air dirty laundry.

179
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,300
I see that it's cleaned.

180
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,030
I did not speak with the press.

181
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,990
Oh,thank you.

182
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,370
Yes.Would you like one?

183
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,660
Excuse me.

184
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,020
One pours from the right.

185
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,520
Always from the right.May I?

186
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,480
Are you feeling warm,sir?

187
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,750
I am.But I've got my own,thanks.

188
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,760
Stanton,you're not under investigation,but
we do have questions about Patrick.

189
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,780
Do you have any reason
to believe this isn't him?

190
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,960
He's grown,of course.But
the mannerisms...

191
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,680
If it isn't,he's a brilliant study.

192
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,150
If he is a fraud,you
could have exposed him.

193
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,080
He might have sabotaged you.

194
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,020
We need physical evidence.A DNA
mismatch would prove he isn't a Wolcott.

195
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,840
Thanks to Elizabeth's recommendation,William
hired me as your replacement.

196
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,130
Excuse me.You?

197
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,050
Rhett Carlyle,domestic artist.

198
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,370
He buttled in a castle in Hampshire.

199
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,700
- It's a verb.
- I am aware.

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,580
How long did you work in Hampshire?

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,890
Till he was caught with a princess.

202
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,900
Suspected.Never caught.

203
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,460
But the evidence was overwhelming.

204
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,710
I didn't steal the silverware.

205
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,100
There is more to private service than
consorting with the landed gentry.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,280
In addition to scheduling
valet and chauffeur duties,

207
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,040
one needs to develop an
acute sense of observation.

208
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,080
You wear your Oxfords with a
luster,not a shine,lattice-laced.

209
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,750
Carpal tunnel in your wrist,probably
from years of pouring from the right.

210
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,960
- And,Peter...Peter.
- Yes.

211
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,120
Muscle fatigue,dry
lips,watery eyes,nausea--

212
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,610
I am a brilliant study,and this man has the
flu,so you might want to keep your distance.

213
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,340
My life's work has been protecting
that family.I want that to matter.

214
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,170
Then tell me everything I need to
know about taking care of the Wolcotts.

215
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,140
Carlyle.

216
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,560
Chauncey's ready for his walk.

217
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,590
Thank you,Miss Bea.

218
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,530
There's a reading of Franny
and Zooey at the 92nd Street Y.

219
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,570
I managed to secure you two tickets.

220
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,760
Mid-century American
fiction.My weakness.

221
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,910
Come on,Chauncey.

222
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,900
- Hey,Bea.
- Hey,Patrick.

223
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,700
Say hi,Chaunce.

224
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,010
How was your ride?

225
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,480
Every morning there's something
else I remember about this city.

226
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,050
May I take your helmet,sir?

227
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,940
No,I am gonna fix the strap.

228
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,330
May I take your jacket?

229
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,900
No,I got it.

230
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,870
You must be thirsty.

231
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,990
My father thinks people
need servants.I don't.

232
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,110
- I can take care of myself.
- Of course.

233
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,980
Mr.Wolcott,the Times,Herald,and Guardian
all open to the financial section,

234
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,770
and your Amaranth toast with
almond butter's in the dining room.

235
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,850
My blood sugar and I thank you,Carlyle.

236
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,210
- Elizabeth,good morning.
- Good morning,William.

237
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,930
- Carlyle.
- Good morning,Mrs.Burke.

238
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,150
Carlyle is wonderful.Where
did you get him?

239
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,770
Oh,he actually worked for a
family that I'm very close to.

240
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,590
The Picasso's coming this morning,and
I have a De La Tour to show you.

241
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,090
Let's have a look.

242
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,760
Nice uniform,slick.

243
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,050
The family hired a team
of private investigators...

244
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,560
- worked with Interpol...
- Hey,Peter,you try acetaminophen?

245
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,520
Ibuprofen?

246
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,350
The daytime stuff,the nighttime stuff?

247
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,060
What about the pink stuff?

248
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,260
Okay.

249
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,930
- Peter Burke.
- Yeah,stay in there.

250
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,620
You're kicking me out?

251
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,950
- No!No,no,no,just...just taking the appropriate medical precautions.
- Okay.

252
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,590
You can see the
map,right?Everything's good?

253
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,550
Patrick got out of Germany on a barge.

254
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,030
The family paid a ton in tips.

255
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,040
Most of them happened right
after he ran from school.

256
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,900
He was first spotted at the
train station in-- Dusseldorf.

257
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,360
Peter,go home.We got this.Okay?

258
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,250
Caffrey is doing his thing.Go home.

259
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh,I got my tie.

260
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,880
Nothing.

261
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,470
And it's the bottom
of the eighth inning...

262
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,240
- Neal,hey.
- You sound terrible.Where are you?

263
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,470
I'm working from home.

264
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,340
Mr."No Sick Days"" went home."

265
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,490
Did you get the evidence?

266
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,000
It's gonna be harder than we thought.

267
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,950
I dusted Patrick's glass.He wiped it.

268
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,980
You sure about that?

269
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah.Hairbrush is clean.Toothbrush...and
razor are sanitized.

270
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,240
The surfaces are spotless.Either
this guy's a total neat freak...

271
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,270
Or he has a reason to be living
without leaving a...trace.

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,490
Is he this careful all over the house?

273
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,930
Yeah,he wouldn't even
hand me his bike helmet.

274
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,630
He's careful.I think Elizabeth's right.

275
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,090
Yeah.She usually is.

276
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,280
- I gotta go.
- He onto you?

277
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,040
It looks great,you
guys.Thank you so much.

278
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,900
Sorry,Liz.Didn't mean to scare you.

279
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,180
It's okay.I was just
admiring the Picasso.

280
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,410
Remember those guards who
threatened to call The Policia

281
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,550
when my manifesto against
cubism got too loud?

282
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,230
And I used every Spanish word
I knew just to charm them.

283
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,440
You promised that we would go to a bullfight
if I kept my mouth shut,which was a lie.

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,860
But we did go to Tapas at Casa del
Abuelo,and you let me have a cana,

285
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
which was sent over by that
matador who took a shine to you.

286
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,170
- Antonio.
- Paco.

287
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,960
It all came back to me.

288
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,730
Eventually.

289
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,900
Sir?

290
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,270
Miss Bea?

291
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,880
Would you mind keeping it down a little
bit?I'm working on a genealogy project.

292
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,940
Apologies.I mistook it for snooping.

293
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,760
Seems we have a pot-kettle situation.

294
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,440
No comment.

295
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,310
- Find anything interesting?
- Um,travel journal.Fairly informative.

296
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,650
You know,I grew up hearing
all about my brother,

297
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,140
and now that he's actually here,he's
only told me things I already know.

298
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,050
Maybe you could ask about his travels.

299
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,530
It doesn't seem like he
really wants to talk to me.

300
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,780
I'm sorry,Miss Bea.

301
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,450
And now Stanton's
fired,and dad's really sick.

302
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,200
Soon he'll be gone too.

303
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,770
And then it'll just be me and Patrick.

304
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,170
And you don't want to be left
with someone you don't know.

305
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,020
Why are you in here?

306
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
I thought you could wear
this to dinner tonight,sir.

307
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,590
Tell my father no matter how many designer
coats he crams in my closet,I'm not wearing one.

308
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,220
May I ask,how does a teenager
evade an international search?

309
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,740
Doctored my dorm mates' passports,

310
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,550
used 'em to cross borders,and then
traded 'em when I needed supplies.

311
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,970
Bartered to conserve cash.Clever.

312
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,130
Colored contacts,a baseball cap.

313
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,870
Switched up your accents and
avoided Portofino in July?

314
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,780
Santorini was more my style.

315
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,970
- Is that your journal?
- Tales of my travels.

316
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,360
Looks like it got wet.

317
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,890
Dropped it in the Aegean.

318
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,220
- You're lucky,sir.
- Why's that?

319
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,860
After all this,your
father will take you back.

320
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,620
Why not put on a jacket,make
the old man happy?

321
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,920
Carlyle,you are something else.

322
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,950
Enjoy your dinner.

323
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,120
'Cause I got your print.

324
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,470
Honey,herbal tea.

325
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,160
Okay.And I got ginger.

326
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,220
And oscillococcinum.

327
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,190
I don't eat things that I can't say.

328
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,540
At least tell us how you lifted the
cuff link while I eat things I can't say.

329
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,480
PDA.

330
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,320
Public display of affection?

331
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,680
- Elizabeth,can I use your jacket?
- Sure.

332
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,860
I'm not sure I like this.

333
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,170
Clip this to your left sleeve.

334
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,460
This is not going to work.

335
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,370
Oh,it's gonna work.I'm gonna steal
something right off your wrist.

336
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,370
- Watch.
- Oh,I'm watching.

337
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,790
Proximity manipulation.

338
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,330
Diversion technique.

339
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,490
Attention control.

340
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,840
Proximity,diversion,attention.PDA.

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,770
It's still there.

342
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,550
From your other wrist.

343
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,800
I even told you what I was gonna steal.

344
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,250
Wristwatch.You have a gentle touch.

345
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,470
Oh,oh,that's enough.

346
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,120
Hey,Jones.

347
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,100
Oh,better.

348
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,530
Got it.Thanks.

349
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,570
Well,do you have a magic trick that
can turn bad news into good news?

350
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,460
Why,what's up?

351
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,380
The prints on the
cuff link were perfect,

352
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,840
except they belong to a person
who's never committed a crime.

353
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,680
And it wasn't common to fingerprint
kids when Patrick was younger,

354
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,820
so he's not in the database.

355
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,420
I could send it to Quantico
for a mitochondrial DNA test.

356
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,110
That takes too long.I can get some
actual DNA,and we can run the test here.

357
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,810
Return the cuff link and
try my technique..G.A.F.

358
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,260
- G.A.F.
- Grab a fork.

359
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,390
Grab
- literally steal the silverware.

360
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,740
You're a cliche.

361
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,890
Get over it.

362
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,790
He's grumpy when he's sick.Lean back.

363
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,520
- Hey,what's up?
- Oh,hey.Yeah.

364
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,690
How's life on Golden Pond?

365
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,620
And I see you opened the Brunello.

366
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:01,240
- Oh,yeah,I saved you...Enjoy.
- Thanks.

367
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,610
- Moz.
- Oh,for once I'm not the only one in the room with a buzz.

368
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,540
It's loud for one hive.

369
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,550
I may have acquired three.

370
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,700
Skinny Gianetta got nabbed,so
his wife put out feelers.

371
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,830
So in addition to me being undercover
as a butler and taking care of Peter,

372
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,690
I'm now the guardian of orphan bees.

373
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,410
What ails the Suit?

374
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,070
It's that flu that's going around.

375
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,650
That's perfect.

376
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,960
It seems fitting that a man of his
persuasion should be my Guinea pig.

377
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,800
18 amino acids packed into an
antimicrobial,flavonoid-filled,

378
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,210
honey-based tonic that will rid you
of your symptoms and also cure warts,

379
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,810
elevate your mood,and
enhance performance.

380
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,690
Thank me later.Or don't.

381
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,720
- Don't.
- Don't.

382
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm supposed to drink this?

383
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,740
One now,the second in two hours,and the
third within four hours of the first.

384
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,780
Oh,I must be crazy
to even consider this.

385
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,680
- Could you feel any worse?
- Probably not.

386
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,360
I got to get to the
Wolcotts.Feel better,Peter.

387
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,470
I'll stay here and observe.

388
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,450
Observe what?What's gonna happen?

389
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,800
Well,the first 15 minutes
- well,let's see.

390
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,990
Well,it's going to happen.

391
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,430
Dad,it's not what I want.

392
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,180
It's what I want.Consider that.

393
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,730
My attorney is sending it over.

394
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,680
- May I take your cup?
- No.

395
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,900
No.

396
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,060
So this conversation's over.

397
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,220
In my mind it is.

398
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,190
Let's talk about something else.

399
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,300
Did you know that Picasso used
to burn his own work for warmth?

400
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,330
That's right.He did.

401
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,480
Sir.

402
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,040
Oh,this was a mistake.

403
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,630
It was supposed to go
to the business manager.

404
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,410
Here you go.

405
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,160
- Thank you.
- Good afternoon.

406
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,020
Time for vial number two.

407
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,670
Where'd Mozzie go?

408
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,520
He needed to check on his queen.

409
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,690
Assuming he meant bee,but with him...

410
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,930
You never know.

411
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,480
This came for you.

412
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,110
I can't open it.It's
for William Wolcott.

413
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,750
But it's addressed to Peter Burke.

414
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,740
You know,I think your wife had to open
it for you because you're extremely sick.

415
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,240
Besides,no one will ever
know.We can just reseal it.

416
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,290
Neal's a very bad influence on you.

417
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,070
- Oh,yes.
- That was perfect.

418
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,880
Neal found out what Patrick's after
- a trust fund.

419
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,240
He was supposed to
inherit it when he was 21.

420
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,580
They're redoing the paperwork today.

421
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,500
- $40 million.
- Yeah.

422
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,110
Honey,if he gets
that,he's gonna disappear.

423
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,600
William's heart can't take that.

424
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,180
I got to let him know what's going on.

425
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,740
No.Bring William to the
FBI.I want to talk to him.

426
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,500
I'm not sure what this Patrick is
capable of.He could be dangerous.

427
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,820
Babe,look,this is a hard
conversation to have with a father,

428
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,260
and it needs to come from a
friend.Besides,you need to take it easy.

429
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,760
No,I don't want to take it easy.

430
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,210
- I feel better.
- Well,that's great.

431
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,690
I'll let you know how it
goes at the Wolcotts',okay?

432
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,480
Besides,I want you to lay down.

433
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,800
William,I'm not trying to upset you.

434
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,830
Being married to an FBI
agent has made you cynical.

435
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,960
It's time for your Insulin,sir.

436
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,310
This has nothing to do with Peter,okay?

437
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,990
- I was fooled too.
- I'm offended,Elizabeth!

438
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
The whole house can hear you.

439
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,440
This is ridiculous.

440
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,810
Patrick should have no problem
consenting to a blood test.

441
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,790
You don't believe me?

442
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,120
Fine.Draw the blood right now.

443
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,520
I don't need this,Patrick.

444
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,070
She does.How many others
think you're a fool?

445
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,100
I won't stick a needle into my own son.

446
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,580
Okay.I'll do it.

447
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,120
There.Test it.

448
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,980
The house is equidistant from the
avenues,but we don't want him to get that far.

449
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,140
Entry and exit points of the
Wolcott residence,upper windows too.

450
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,500
We're gonna have three agents by the utility van,two more undercover...
- Three more.

451
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,930
Look,Peter,you're a biohazard.

452
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,330
I'm on the mend.I
swear.And after this...

453
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,650
- What is it?
- I don't know.

454
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,860
- Mozzie gave it to me.
- Oh,God.

455
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,600
It works.I'm in on this
bust.My wife is in there.

456
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,540
- When it all goes down,we'll move in for the arrest.
- Good boy.

457
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,790
Come on,Chauncey.

458
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,090
It looks like Mozzie's
tincture's working.

459
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm coming off the DL.

460
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,680
Baseball.Disabled list.

461
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,010
Did you check out the lab
they used to test the blood?

462
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,560
It's reputable.I put an agent there
in case Patrick tried anything.

463
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,910
William had the sample
picked up from the house.

464
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,330
I sealed it and handed it
to the technician myself.

465
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,540
So Patrick didn't tamper with it.

466
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,730
No,but I'm sure he has something planned
when the DNA comes back a mismatch.

467
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,130
I want to know what it is.Audio.

468
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,300
Check one,two.Check one,two.

469
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,080
I'll keep an eye on Elizabeth.

470
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,980
Come on,Chaunce.Come
on.That's a good boy.

471
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,030
Everything all right,Miss Bea?

472
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,370
The blood tests are back.

473
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,580
What we have here,Carlyle,is
a real moment of truth.

474
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,130
Everyone,I have news,and
you need to hear it.

475
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,640
You've all been working very hard
to prepare for the party on Sunday,

476
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,710
but there's been a change of plans.

477
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,990
The celebration will
now take place tomorrow.

478
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,390
I don't want to wait any
longer to welcome home my son.

479
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,560
I'm so glad to be back.

480
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,520
I shouldn't have put you through this.

481
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,840
The DNA was a match.

482
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,310
Also I want to thank Elizabeth
for all that she's done.

483
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,430
Today is her last day.

484
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,940
William,I'm sorry.

485
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,890
- You know I was just thinking of you and Bea.
- The days I have left with my son are numbered.

486
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,470
Forcing him to do this,he could have walked
out the door,and it would have been your fault.

487
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,470
I'll send your check.

488
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,960
What did I do?

489
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,590
Well,I'm fired,and you don't
have to be a butler anymore.

490
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,980
I can't just leave.

491
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,110
Maybe I'll see how French
that maid really is.

492
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,360
Liz.I tried to talk to my father,but
you know how stubborn he is.

493
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,410
Well,he's upset with me,and
I can understand that.

494
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,830
I already took Chauncey on his walk.

495
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,720
Well,I heard him coughing.

496
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,970
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

497
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,990
Well,if he's not feeling
well,he shouldn't walk.

498
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,160
- It's not far.
- It is if he can't breathe.

499
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,320
Don't worry.I'll drive them.

500
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,520
I'll get the car.Good day,Mrs.Burke.

501
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,120
Take care,Patrick.

502
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,350
You too,Liz.

503
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,580
- Wait here,and don't move the car.
- Yes,sir.

504
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,540
Hey,Peter.Patrick hates the dog.

505
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,880
Now he's bringing it to the vet.

506
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,820
I heard.You're wired.

507
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,490
You've gone from My Man
Godfrey to Ace Ventura.

508
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,090
I'm telling you,he's got another move.

509
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:05,060
- Neal,recon only.You find anything,you pull me in.
- You got it.

510
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,550
I feel good.Really good.

511
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,750
Great.You and the Wolcotts' dog.

512
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
Patrick went to the vet for himself.

513
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,110
I watched the tech remove
something from his arm right here.

514
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:49,790
- Plastic?
- Yeah.

515
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,810
- Look like a vein?
- I don't know.It was about 2/3 this size.

516
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,050
That's a Penrose drain.

517
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,660
There was a case in Florida-- a guy
implanted one to fool a DNA test.

518
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,020
- Filled with someone else's blood?
- Yeah.

519
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,930
That's why Patrick drew his own.

520
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,600
This blood was fresh.

521
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,950
Which means 48 hours ago the
real Patrick Wolcott was alive.

522
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,450
And in New York.You know,we're
kind of good at this.

523
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,520
- What?
- William's signing over the trust fund tomorrow.

524
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,990
And once fake Patrick
gets what he wants...

525
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,380
- he won't have any reason to keep the real Patrick around.
- No.

526
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,900
We pulled in the vet tech.

527
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,170
Of course he denies
implanting a Penrose drain.

528
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,970
We searched the property.No
signs of the tubing.

529
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,500
We're holding him on suspicion
so he can't tip Patrick off?

530
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
You better believe it.

531
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,140
Well,we won't get a warrant for another DNA
testing without permission from the family.

532
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,070
Why don't we just grab the bastard
and tell him we know about the drain?

533
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,040
Tempting,but we have no leverage.

534
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,120
So let's get some leverage.

535
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,320
How do we do that?

536
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,470
Picasso.

537
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,280
Yeah,yeah,Picasso.

538
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,700
All right,our imposter learned
everything he could about Patrick's life.

539
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,870
But he didn't know Elizabeth's Picasso
story,which proves he doesn't know everything.

540
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,740
Yeah,and he doesn't know
what he doesn't know.

541
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:19,820
We need to ask him something that he thinks
only the real Patrick knows the answer to.

542
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,710
And give him a reason
to get that answer.

543
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,010
Elizabeth asks him about Picasso--
the next morning he knows everything.

544
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,660
The bike rides.

545
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,600
He goes on one every
morning.It's always for an hour.

546
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,190
That's got to be how he's
keeping Patrick alive.

547
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,610
- And how he got the Picasso story.
- And the blood.

548
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,640
Jones,get a radius set up in op
- car,bike,foot,whatever.

549
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,500
Make sure we stay on him wherever he goes.
- Gotcha.

550
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,670
Patrick was gone for 15 years.

551
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,590
He probably didn't meet
the imposter right away.

552
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,180
The first time he was spotted after he ran
away from boarding school was at Dusseldorf.

553
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,660
And that's where Leo Kovak comes in.

554
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,210
Who is Leo Kovak?

555
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,380
He's the reason fake Patrick
has to get the answer.

556
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,420
Who is Leo Kovak?

557
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm Leo Kovak?

558
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,910
You are a very angry Croatian.

559
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,890
You work for the Von Kesslers,and you want
to know what the hell happened in Dusseldorf.

560
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,570
What happened in Dusseldorf?

561
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,140
It's--it's got to
be more convincing.

562
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
What happened in Dusseldorf?

563
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,690
Nothing.But Patrick doesn't know that.

564
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,510
Croatians invented neckties,

565
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,130
and I'm sure you've got something in
your closet that screams enraged Balkan.

566
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,770
I can't do Croatian.I'm going Polish.

567
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,410
Let's pick out that tie.

568
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,860
Mr.Kovak is here to see you.

569
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,730
I'm a friend of the Von Kesslers.

570
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,690
Of course.The Von Kesslers.

571
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,090
It's been a while since Dusseldorf.

572
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,200
Thank you,Carlyle.

573
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,740
I followed you and your
story in the papers,Patrick.

574
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,860
That's how we found you.

575
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,900
- I'm sorry.Do I...
- You should be sorry for what you did.

576
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,440
Sir,I don't understand.

577
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,480
Don't play stupid.Don't start crying.

578
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,380
The Von Kesslers pay me
to handle their problems.

579
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:23,020
Is there any way I can pay
them for this inconvenience?

580
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,970
You think you can put
a price on what you did?

581
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,960
That money can make this go away?

582
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,010
No.They want answers.

583
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,710
Compliments of the chef.

584
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,690
Anything else,sir?

585
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,340
A pen and something to write.

586
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,000
Call me.We can make Dusseldorf go away.

587
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,160
But if you don't,I'll see
you at your party tonight.

588
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,630
I'll show myself out.

589
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,590
If I may,sir...

590
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,010
that threat didn't sound hollow.

591
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,670
I'm going for a bike ride.

592
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,020
Enjoy the fresh air.

593
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,270
He's exiting the park
at Morningside and 116th.

594
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,930
I've got him.

595
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,160
I wouldn't peg you
for a fed in this car.

596
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,450
Perimeter is all set.

597
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,010
We'll pinch Patrick at the location.

598
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,770
While we're waiting,may I...

599
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,850
Thanks,Leo.

600
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,410
North on Manhattan.Handing off.

601
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,770
Listen to that!

602
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,210
Hard turn,114th.

603
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,280
Agent down!We lost the suspect!

604
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,840
- Neal,get out.
- I'm a butler.

605
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,610
I'm trained for this.

606
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Call an ambulance.All agents to
First Avenue and 114th street.

607
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,620
Agent Burke and Caffrey are en route.

608
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,040
- Team two has him.West on 116th.
- This is 116th.

609
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,470
Neal.

610
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,940
- Neal.
- Don't look.

611
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,910
I have to look.I can't help it.

612
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,490
There he goes.

613
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,720
Lost sight of the suspect at the
corner of Morningside and 115th.

614
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,200
That must be some butler college.

615
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,220
Where's he keeping Patrick?

616
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,360
He was just here.

617
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,700
Got to be somewhere close.

618
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,840
All right,we're gonna
have to go door to door.

619
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,140
I want a team on this building,down
there,and a team across the street.

620
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,250
Team two,let's go.

621
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,800
- Hey,Peter.
- Yeah,what do you have?

622
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,200
This may be a long shot,but Patrick said
he dropped his travel journal in the Aegean.

623
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,370
Not exactly the Aegean,but
let's have a look.

624
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,070
For the last time,Dusseldorf.

625
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,360
What the hell happened?

626
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,020
Nothing happened in Dusseldorf.

627
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,540
The Von Kesslers are pissed,and
this Kovaks guy is coming after you.

628
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,240
I don't know any of these people.

629
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,570
Okay,fine.Fine.We'll
do this the hard way.

630
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,080
The hard way is what's gonna happen
if you don't put that taser down.

631
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,140
Peter Burke,FBI.Cuff him.

632
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,880
- I'm not a butler.
- Let's go.

633
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,530
Everything's gonna be okay,all right?

634
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,170
- Patrick.
- Dad.

635
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,690
I wanted him to be you so
much,I let myself believe.

636
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,130
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,620
I'm sorry I let him into our lives.

638
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,170
Liz.

639
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,900
Bea?

640
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,100
You should know,I'm used
to being an only child.

641
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,760
Patrick and Keith- that's his
real name-- met on Santorini.

642
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,220
People said they could
pass for brothers.

643
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,900
When Patrick decided to come
home,Keith offered to come with him.

644
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,770
He took Patrick
hostage,read his journals.

645
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,340
That man stole his life.

646
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,380
And now he's got it back again.

647
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,380
- Thanks to you.
- Thanks to us.

648
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,720
Are you up for some...some baseball?

649
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,280
- A night game?
- Yeah.I figured we could pick up where we left off.

650
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:40,030
I could
probably-- Oh,no.

651
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,550
Damn it.I'll call Mozzie.

652
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,110
Wait,wait,wait,hold on.If you've had
this flu already,I think we're safe.
