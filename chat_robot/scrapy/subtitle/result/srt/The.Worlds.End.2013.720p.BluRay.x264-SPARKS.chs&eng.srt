1
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,265
你们经历过这样的夜晚吗?
Ever had one of those nights

2
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:36,876
开始的时候平平常常 后来却永生难忘
that starts out like any other, but ends up being the best night of your life?

3
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:41,116
大家坐好了吗? 我们要开始了
Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin.

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,816
那是1990年6月22日 我们毕业的前一天
It was June the 22nd, 1990, our final day of school.

5
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:52,088
有奥利弗・钱伯莱恩 皮特・佩奇 史蒂文・普林斯 安迪・奈特利 和我
There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page, Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me.

6
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,968
我们叫我老金 因为我的名字是加里・金
They called me The King. Because my name's Gary King.

7
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,961
奥利挺有意思 他自以为风流倜傥 但其实只会耍嘴皮子
Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit of a player, but really, he was all mouth.

8
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,429
我们叫他圈仔
We called him O-Man

9
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,265
因为他额头上有个"6"形状的胎记
because he had a birthmark on his forehead that looked like a six.

10
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,246
他喜欢那个胎记
He loved it.

11
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,636
皮特是我们的老幺
Pete was the baby of the group.

12
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,084
他不是我们常一起混的那种孩子 但是他很搞笑
He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually hang out with, but he was good for a laugh.

13
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,016
而且他是个土豪
And he was absolutely minted.

14
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,815
史蒂文很酷 我们一起厮混 一起追女孩子
Steve was a pretty cool guy. We jammed together, chased the girls.

15
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,085
我觉得他把我看做对手 但我们关系很好
I think he saw us as rivals. Sweet, really.

16
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,155
还有安迪 他是我的左膀右臂
And Andy. Andy was my wingman.

17
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,000
他是我最信任的人
The one guy I could rely on to back me up.

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,663
他爱我 而我也爱他 我没开玩笑
He loved me, and I'm not being funny, but I loved him, too.

19
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,265
学校里的一切我们都毫不留恋
There was nothing we were gonna miss about school.

20
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,336
或许有点舍不得谢菲尔德老师
Maybe Mr. Shepherd.

21
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,070
他确实是个好人
He was definitely one of the good guys.

22
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,545
他曾经问过我以后有什么打算
He used to ask me what I wanted to do with my life,

23
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,598
我告诉他 我只想找点乐子
I told him I just wanted to have a good time.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,709
他说我们不正经 但其实不然
He thought that was funny. It wasn't meant to be.

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,053
最起码那晚我们很认真
Not that night.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,057
纽顿海文是我们的家乡 我们的游乐场 我们的宇宙
Newton Haven was our hometown. Our playground, our universe.

27
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,028
而在那一晚 那里是传奇探险的发生地
And that night it was the site of a heroic quest.

28
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,100
目标? 完成豪饮马拉松
The aim? To conquer The Golden Mile.

29
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:07,329
十二家酒馆组成了我们的纵情畅饮之旅
Twelve pubs along a legendary path of alcoholic indulgence.

30
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,528
它们是一号邮局 老相识
There was The First Post, The Old Familiar,

31
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,032
闻名雄鸡 交叉之手 好伙伴
The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands, The Good Companions,

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,079
忠仆 双头狗 美人鱼 蜂窝
The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,

33
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,836
国王之颅 墙洞...
The King's Head, The Hole in the Wall...

34
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,081
但我们最终的目的地是 世界的尽头
All before reaching our destiny, The World's End.

35
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,515
我们开着我的车进了城
We took my car into town.

36
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,715
我管它叫野兽 因为它真的很猛
I called it The Beast because she was pretty hairy.

37
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,881
我们的长大成人之旅由此开始
And so, our journey into manhood began.

38
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,453
我们出发了 把握好每一寸光阴
We were off. We didn't waste any time.

39
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,757
我们去了酒吧 大喝一场
We hit pub one and we hit it hard.

40
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,327
我们醉了 我们笑了 我们针锋相对
There was drinking, there was fun, there was controversy,

41
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,393
有小妞 有烈酒 有好戏看
there were ladies, there were shots, there was drama,

42
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,307
当然了 最重要的还是有酒喝
and of course, there was drinking.

43
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,234
喝到第五家 我们觉得自己天下无敌
By pub five, we were feeling invincible

44
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,802
于是决定从那个叫绿圣人的人那里
and decided to purchase some herbal refreshment

45
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,672
买点带劲的草本物质
from a man we called The Reverend Green.

46
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,916
喝到第六杯 圈仔不省人事 于是我们扔下他继续走
Pint six put O-Man out of commission, so we carried on without him.

47
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,711
幸好如此 在下一间酒吧我遇到了他妹妹
Good thing, I bumped into his sister in the next pub,

48
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,454
我们躲进残障洗手间 我又上了她一次
we went into the disableds and I bumped into her again.

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,884
山姆跟着我们了一会儿 但是我得甩掉她
Sam tagged along for a while, but then I had to let her go.

50
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,594
因为晚上我和安博尔还有个约会
I had another date that night and her name was Amber.

51
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,470
喝到第九杯 我们开始与世界为敌
Nine pints in and it was us against the world.

52
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,093
在蜂窝 事情有点大条
Things got mental in The Beehive,

53
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,628
但我们在保龄球俱乐部弥补了回来
so we repaired to the bowls club

54
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,874
我们喜欢叫它烟屋 那里的一切都很疯狂
or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse, which is when it all went fuck up.

55
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,303
每个人都迷迷糊糊 皮特吸得脸发白 所以我们让他留下休息
Everyone got para and Pete chucked a whitey, so we had to bench him.

56
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,376
最后 我们喝过了最后三家酒馆 开始向山上进发
In the end, we blew off the last three pubs and headed for the hills.

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,011
我记得坐在那里
I remember sitting up there,

58
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,147
我的指节还在流血 衣服上洒满啤酒 鞋子上沾着呕吐物
blood on my knuckles, beer down my shirt, sick on my shoes,

59
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,492
看着黎明的太阳冲破地平线
seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break

60
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:41,497
我心里明白 生活再也不会像这一刻这样美妙
and knowing in my heart, life would never feel this good again.

61
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,956
知道吗?
And you know what?

62
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,799
确实如此
It never did.

63
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,170
谢谢 加里 非常有启发性
Thank you, Gary. That was very enlightening.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,903
还有人想说点什么吗 或是问加里个问题?
Would anyone like to add anything or maybe challenge Gary?

65
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,672
你失望了吗?
Are you disappointed?

66
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,553
- 失望什么?  - 你们最终没有到达世界的尽头?
- About what?  - That you didn't make it to The World's End?

67
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,585
不
No.

68
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,051
你们到底想要什么?
Just what is it that you want to do?

69
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,053
我们想要自由!
We want to be free!

70
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,123
我们想要为所欲为!
We want to be free to do what we want to do!

71
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,525
我们想喝醉 想玩个痛快
And we want to get loaded. And we want to have a good time,

72
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,160
我们就是这样
And that's what we're going to do.

73
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,795
想要玩个痛快
We're going to have a good time.

74
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,917
我们要举办一场派对
We're going to have a party.

75
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:44,829
世界的尽头

76
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:52,709

你们到底想要做什么?
Just what is it that you want to do?

79
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,051
我们想喝醉 想要玩个痛快
And we want to get loaded. And we want to have a good time,

80
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:52,718
- 它真美  - 但它不是野兽
- She's a beauty.  - Yeah, but she's no Beast.

81
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,553
你好 皮特
Hello, Peter.

82
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,591
天啊! 加里?
Jesus! Gary?

83
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,767
永远的老金
The once and future King.

84
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,268
今天早上是你在我家外面晃吗?
Were you outside my house this morning?

85
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,565
不是
No.

86
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,295
我敢肯定我看到你在我家门口的大街上
I could have sworn I saw you on my street.

87
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,231
我从来没去过毕肖普花园
I've never been to Bishop's Gardens.

88
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,532
你还好吗 哥们?
How you doing, man?

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,968
- 还好 你呢?  - 我很好
- I'm well. You?  - Yeah, never better.

90
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,505
- 她怎么样...  - 你说维尼萨?
- How is, uh...  - Vanessa?

91
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,071
- 不 我说的是你妻子?  - 她叫维尼萨
- No. Your wife?  - Vanessa.

92
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,273
- 好吧 她怎么样?  - 她很好
- Yeah. How's she?  - She's good.

93
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,642
- 你们上床了吗?  - 我们都有两个孩子了
- Have you had sex yet?  - We have two children.

94
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,511
哦 上了两次 你这个大色狼
Ooh, twice. Get you, fuck machine.

95
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,846
我们一点没变 是吧?
We haven't changed, have we?

96
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,114
他来这里干嘛?
What is he doing here?

97
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,149
没事的 爸爸
It's all right, Dad. We're fine.

98
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,595
嗨 P叔
Hi, Mr. P.

99
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,654
加里 有什么能帮你的吗?
So, Gary, how can I help you?

100
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,464
- 你老爹还挺精神  - 你要买车?
- He looks well.  - Are you looking to buy a car?

101
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,798
呃... 不是 我们已经很接近尽头了
Uh... No. I'm afraid the end is nigh.

102
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,563
- 什么?  - 世界的尽头
- What?  - The World's End.

103
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,664
什么意思?
What do you mean?

104
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,401
你懂我的意思的 一晚上 五个人 喝遍十二家酒吧
You know what I mean. One night. Five guys. Twelve pubs.

105
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,710
让酒瓶飞一会
Let battle commence.

106
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,037
你还想再来一次?
You want to try that again?

107
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,672
这难道这不是你一直梦寐以求的吗?
Yeah, isn't that something you've always wanted?

108
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,908
- 不是  - 听着 皮特
- Not particularly. No.  - Look. Peter.

109
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,112
那时我们没有成功 但这次我们一定要到达尽头
We didn't make it before, but this time, we're gonna see it through to the bitter end.

110
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,246
一探究竟
Or lager end.

111
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,915
- 我们?  - 嗯 所有人
- We?  - Yeah, the whole gang.

112
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,556
- 安迪也去?  - 安迪为什么不去?
- Even Andy?  - Why wouldn't Andy be coming?

113
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,687
- 我以为那场事故之后...  - 没那回事 他来的
- Well, I thought that after the accident...  - Notan issue. He's in.

114
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,023
我们只想知道 你来不来?
What we wanna know is are you?

115
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,765
我得问一下维尼萨
I'd have to check with Vanessa.

116
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,693
- 维尼萨是谁  - 我太太
- Who's Vanessa?  - My wife.

117
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,361
从什么时候开始你听老婆的话了?
Since when have you had to check with your wife?

118
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,396
从我们结婚开始
Since we got married.

119
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,531
别这样 哥们 你不怀念那些日子吗?
Oh, come on, man, don't you miss it?

120
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,201
欢笑 兴奋 打架
The laughs, the camaraderie, the fights,

121
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,910
醉得好像脑袋要炸掉一样
the hangovers so fierce it feels like your head is full of ants.

122
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,109
前两个比较怀念
Maybe the first two.

123
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,184
好了 你的新号码是什么?
It begins. What's your new number?

124
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,686
我十年来一直用的那个号码啊
Same one I've had for 10 years.

125
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,945
嗯 号码是什么?
Yeah. What's that one?

126
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,451
这一排房子屋顶上有天窗
This entire row here, they'll all have dormer windows above the front elevation.

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,453
那是谁没戴安全帽?
Who's the helmet without an helmet?

128
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,864
是加里・金
That's Gary King.

129
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,166
咚咚咚
Knock, knock.

130
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,038
你来这里干嘛 加里?
What are you doing here, Gary?

131
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,646
你应该说"谁在敲门?"
You're supposed to say, "Who's there?"

132
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,748
我可以看到你
I can see who's there. It's you.

133
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,307
我喜欢你盖的房子 通风不错
I like what you've done with the place. Bit draughty.

134
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,948
- 瑟琳娜还好吗?  - 我们十年前就离婚了
- How's Selina?  - We divorced 10 years ago.

135
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,912
我知道 我就是问问她好不好
Yeah, I know, just wondered how she was.

136
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,448
很显然 她过得不错
She's doing very well, apparently.

137
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,849
你有下一个目标了吗?
Have you got anyone else on the go?

138
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,423
是的 她是个健身教练 二十六岁
Yeah, I do, as it happens. She's a fitness instructor. Twenty-six.

139
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,228
恋童癖 我开玩笑的 有机会我想见见她
Pedophile. I'm kidding. I'd love to meet her sometime.

140
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,924
别了 你来这里干嘛?
No. Why are you here?

141
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,532
你没听说吗? 我们要东山再起
Haven't you heard? We're getting the band back together.

142
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,763
我早都不玩贝斯了
I'm not your bass player anymore.

143
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,832
我是说兄弟联盟要东山再起
No, I mean we're getting the boys back together.

144
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,437
如果你希望 乐队也可以重组
We can get the band back together as well if you want.

145
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,903
不行了 你用我的吉他换毒品了
No, we can't. You sold my guitar to buy drugs.

146
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,240
我一直都很好奇 门上面的那个是什么?
I've always wondered, what's that thing over the door called?

147
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,242
是门梁
That's a lintel.

148
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,444
计划是这样的 我们回到纽顿海文
So, the plan is, we're going to go back to Newton Haven,

149
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,645
去完成豪饮马拉松
we are gonna do The Golden Mile

150
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,615
这次我们一定要到达世界的尽头
and this time, we are gonna make it to The World's End.

151
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,950
大家都来
Everybody's in.

152
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,151
安迪也去?
What, even Andy?

153
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,753
一点没错
Oh, you better believe it, big balls.

154
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,522
- 安迪答应和你们一起喝酒?  - 和我们一起
- Andy is going drinking with you?  - With us.

155
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,027
考虑一下吧 回到老地方 大伙一起喝点酒
Think about it, go back to the old town, sink a few pints...

156
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,765
- 喝十二杯  - 嗯
- Twelve pints.  - Yeah.

157
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,999
- 喝十二杯太疯狂了  - 我知道!
- Twelve pints is insane.  - I know!

158
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,135
为什么要这么做 加里?
What is this all about, Gary?

159
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,935
因为要有始有终
It's about closure, you know.

160
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,105
为什么岁月会磨灭我们珍贵的友情?
Why should getting older affect something as important as friendship?

161
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,950
- 我们都变了很多 奥利弗  - 是的
- A lot's changed since then, Oliver.  - Right.

162
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,811
我们可以好好叙叙旧
This is our chance to take stock.

163
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,792
叙叙旧? 听你说倒是挺有意思的
A stock take? You make it sound so much fun.

164
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,115
别这样 圈仔 你难道不想那样吗?
Come on, O-Man. Isn't that something you'd like?

165
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,584
我只想让你别躺在沙发上
What I'd really like is for you to take your DMs off the sofa.

166
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,687
听着 如果你担心我 大可不必
Look. If you're worried about me, don't be. All right?

167
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,824
我是来告诉你 加里・金放马回来了
I'm here to tell you that Gary King is back on the horse.

168
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,727
哇 哇 你放马回来了?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're back on the horse?

169
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,763
好吧 我是骑自行车回来的
No, I mean I'm back on the bike.

170
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,063
- 自行车是什么意思?  - 怎么了?
- What is bike?  - What do you mean?

171
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,731
- 自行车有什么内涵?  - 就是自行车
- What is bike slang for?  - Bicycle.

172
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,832
- 我晕了  - 别这样
- I'm lost.  - Don't be.

173
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,067
- 好吧  - 听着
- Okay.  - Listen.

174
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,708
我们终于有机会完成心愿了
This is our chance to finally finish what we started.

175
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,477
来吧 哥们 疯狂一回!
Come on, man, it'll be fucking mental!

176
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,475
我们看完了...
I think we're all done. So...

177
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,010
你们觉得这处房子怎么样?
How do you like the property?

178
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,012
- 还不错  - 位置多好啊
- Yeah. It's amazing.  - Amazing location.

179
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,747
- 很棒  - 确实很棒
- Fantastic.  - Fantastic aspects.

180
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,583
- 但有点...  - 有点超出我们的预算了
- It's just...  - It's just a little bit out of our price range.

181
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,518
他会给你们优惠的 你们能出多少?
He'll knock some off for you. What's it down for?

182
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,487
- 一百二十万  - 去死吧!
- 1.2 million.  - Fuck off!

183
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,158
你们有我名片
You have my card.

184
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,360
加里 搞什么?
Gary, WTF?

185
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,929
我也很想你 圈仔
It's good to see you, too, O-Man.

186
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,564
- 别叫我圈仔 拜托了  - 好吧
- Please don't call me O-Man.  - Sure.

187
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,466
- 嘿 你妹妹怎么样了?  - 她很好
- Hey, how's your sister?  - She's fine.

188
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,667
- 她常提起我吗?  - 没有
- She talk about me?  - No.

189
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,535
周五我们一起出发
So, Friday, we'll all go down together.

190
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,913
来个公路旅行 我来开车
Make a road trip of it, I'll drive.

191
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,518
我好像不行 我约了医生
Don't think I can. I think I've got a doctor's appointment.

192
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,219
是啊 你约了"醉好"的医生!
Yeah, you do. With Dr. Ink!

193
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,350
- 你知道吗?  - "醉好"的医生 我听到了
- You know, Dr. Ink?  - Yeah. "Drink." I get it.

194
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,315
别这样 没有圈仔怎么行
Come on. It wouldn't be the same without the O-Man.

195
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,349
天啊
Jesus.

196
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,320
你能见到大家伙 看看他们都过得怎么样 也说说你过得怎么样
You can see the guys, see how they're doing. Tell them how you're doing.

197
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,801
这次我们或许能到达尽头
You never know, you might make it to the end this time.

198
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,067
- 安迪肯定会去?  - 嗯
- And Andy's definitely coming?  - Yeah.

199
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,729
- 安迪・奈特利?  - 没错
- Andy Knightley?  - Totes.

200
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,869
你已经跟他说好了?
And you convinced him how?

201
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,073
- 奈特利先生  - 有事吗
- Mr. Knightley.  - Felicity.

202
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,912
有位朋友想见您
You have a friend here to see you.

203
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,087
我不想见他
No, I don't.

204
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,653
- 真是有模有样 对吧?  - 嗯
- This is a bit grown up, isn't it?  - Yup.

205
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,086
- 前几天碰到哥几个了  - 嗯
- Saw the boys the other day.  - Mmm-hmm.

206
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,227
圈仔 史蒂文 还有皮特
O-Man, Stevie-Baby, the Petertron.

207
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,593
发小的名字我没忘记 加里
Yeah, I remember the names of our childhood friends, Gary.

208
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,763
我们有个小点子
We had ourselves a little idea.

209
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,864
是吗?
Did you now?

210
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,435
我们想回到纽顿海文
Yeah. We're going to go back to Newton Haven.

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,742
- 为什么?  - 为了未完成的事业
- Why?  - For some unfinished business.

212
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,117
你在开玩笑吗?
That's a joke, right?

213
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,077
- 五个哥们 十二家酒馆 五十杯啤酒  - 是六十杯
- Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints.  - Sixty pints.

214
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,955
是吗 你这个大酒鬼
Steady on, you fucking alky.

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,315
我十六年来滴酒不沾 加里
I haven't had a drink for 16 years, Gary.

216
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,284
那你肯定很想喝点
You must be thirsty then.

217
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,587
我们可以回去 大伙一起吃吃饭 就像以前一样
We can go back, see the guys, chew the fat, it'll be just like it always was,

218
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,523
但这一次我们不达目的誓不罢休
except this time we're going to finish this thing once and for all.

219
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,226
- 你还真是选择性记忆啊 加里  - 好吧
- You have a very selective memory, Gary.  - Thanks.

220
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,961
你只记得周五晚上
You remember the Friday nights.

221
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,162
而我还记着周一早上
I remember the Monday mornings.

222
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,234
所以我们选周五晚上回去呀
Yeah, that's why we're going back on a Friday.

223
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,205
你知道为什么我们全都离开纽顿海文吗?
Why do you think none of us live in Newton Haven anymore?

224
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,904
- 不知道  - 因为那是个黑洞 乏味无聊
- I don't know.  - Because it's a black hole. It's boring.

225
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,773
过去现在将来一直如此
It always was and it always will be.

226
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,118
因为我们不在那里 所以才无聊的
It's only boring because we're not there.

227
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,278
- 对牛弹琴  - 没错 所以你就来吧
- It's pointless arguing with you.  - Exactly. So come.

228
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,015
我星期五三点整到海威科姆车站接你们
I'm picking everybody up from High Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp.

229
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,083
不 加里
No, Gary.

230
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,485
天啊 怎么了? 你也要问问你太太吗?
Oh, God, why? Have you got to check with your missus?

231
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,797
不 我不用问我太太
No, actually, I don't have to check with my missus.

232
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,270
- 你干嘛?  - 这是出去的门
- What are you doing?  - I'm showing you the door.

233
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,562
这是门吗? 怎么没有门梁
Is it a door? It doesn't have a lintel.

234
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,765
它是玻璃的 所以这是窗还是门?
And it's glass. So is it a window or is it a door?

235
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,970
或者是个门窗 这样就行了
Maybe it's a windoor. You can have that.

236
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,279
请走吧 加里
Please leave, Gary.

237
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,419
好吧 好吧
All right. All right.

238
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,858
600英镑 对吧?
￡600, wasn't it?

239
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,793
- 我应该告诉你  - 什么?
- Oh, urn, I thought you should know.  - What?

240
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,157
我妈去世了
Mum died.

241
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,195
- 什么时候?  - 几个礼拜前
- When?  - Couple of weeks ago.

242
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,306
是癌症
The big cancer.

243
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,336
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,013
她很喜欢你
She just always really liked you, you know.

245
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,504
她走了 让我想起了以前
Got me thinking about the old days.

246
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,883
特别是那天晚上 因为那时我们真的很开心
Particularly that night, you know, because we were so happy.

247
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,678
这些哥们和我亲如兄弟
And, you know, I love the boys like brothers,

248
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,718
但是话说回来 你才是我最好的朋友
but when all's said and done, you're the best friend I ever had.

249
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,692
能见到你真好 哥们
It was good to see you, mate.

250
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,033
皮特?
Pete?

251
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,868
- 史蒂文  - 太好了
- Steven.  - Thank God.

252
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,803
我还担心只有我一个人会来呢
I had a horrible feeling I was going to be the only one here.

253
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,506
我敢打赌肯定有更糟的事情等着你
I reckon that's not the last horrible feeling you're gonna have today, mate.

254
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,707
不会吧?
This can't be happening. Can it?

255
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,642
说不准 我们来这是干嘛的?
You said it. What the hell are we doing here?

256
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,144
我们总是这样
What we always did.

257
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,880
跟在加里・金屁股后面到处逛
Follow Gary King into almost certain oblivion.

258
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,148
你好 史蒂文
Hello, Steven.

259
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,349
你还好吧 哥们?
You all right, mate?

260
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,795
- 皮特  - 嗨 哥们
- Pete.  - Hi, mate.

261
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,254
我们不是从1992年开始就不叫他无敌领袖了吗?
Didn't we decide to stop calling him Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?

262
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,522
真是本性难移
Old habits die hard.

263
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,090
他们会把这几个字刻在加里的墓碑上
They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.

264
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,825
不会的 他肯定活的比我们长
No, they won't. You know he'll outlive us all.

265
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,560
要是那样就有意思了
That'll be funny if it wasn't true.

266
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,529
- 等一下  - 怎么了?
- Hang on a sec.  - What?

267
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,732
我想知道我们究竟谁是最傻的那一个
I'm just trying to decide which of us is the biggest idiot for coming.

268
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,442
也许他出车祸了 不好意思 安迪
Maybe he had an accident. Oh, sorry, Andy.

269
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,844
- 抱歉  - 没事 没事
- Sorry.  - No, no, no. It's fine.

270
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,112
我觉得加里要是真出了车祸
I think Gary having an accident

271
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,787
这对我们都好 对他自己也好
would actually be the best outcome for all of us, including Gary.

272
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,597
没搞错吧
Unbelievable.

273
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,495
来吧
Oh, yes.

274
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,594
看看这些贱人
Look at these cunts.

275
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,129
- 你迟到了  - 没有
- You're late.  - No, I'm not.

276
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,633
你有 你说的是三点 现在都快四点了
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00. It's almost 4:00.

277
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,200
对 不三不四嘛
Yeah, 3 for 4.

278
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,135
你知道吗 加里? 你从来不肯低头认错
You know your problem, Gary? You're never wrong.

279
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,236
这有什么不对吗?
How is that a problem?

280
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,171
真不敢相信 你又买了一辆格拉纳达二代
I can't believe you bought another Granada Mark II.

281
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,239
什么意思?
What do you mean?

282
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,875
它和我89年卖给你的那辆一模一样
This looks exactly like the car I sold you in 1989.

283
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,878
这就是1989年你卖给我的那辆 300英镑真是物超所值
This is the car you sold me in 1989. Best 300 quid I ever spent.

284
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,290
- 这是野兽?  - 嗯
- This is The Beast?  - Yeah.

285
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,849
差不多吧 我把她修整了一下
Pretty much. I mean, she's had a bit of work done.

286
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,052
换了刹车 悬架 排气管 座椅 轮胎
I had to replace the brakes, suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels,

287
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,455
嵌板 化油器 分电盘 全套发动机 后视镜 还有头灯
paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.

288
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,991
但除此之外 它还是原来那样车
Other than that, she's the same old motor.

289
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,335
它可以算是古董了
You could almost say an antique.

290
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,636
我们开着这个古董上路表演吧
Well, then let's get this antique on the roadshow.

291
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,217
来吧 巡回演出 别晚了
Come on, you bellends. We're going to be late.

292
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,619
我们回来了 就像五个火枪手
And we're back. Just like the Five Musketeers.

293
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,311
不是三个火枪手吗?
Three Musketeers, isn't it?

294
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,878
算上达达尼昂是四个
Four if you count D'Artagnan,

295
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,880
没人知道他们到底有几个人 是吧 皮特?
Well, nobody knows how many there were, really, do they, Pete?

296
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,251
"三个火枪手"是部小说 你知道的吧?
You do know that The Three Musketeers is a fiction, right?

297
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,352
大仲马写的?
Written by Alexandre Dumas?

298
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,162
现在很多人老这么念叨圣经
A lot of people are saying that about the Bible these days.

299
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,289
怎么了 难不成也是大仲马写的?
What, that it was written by Alexandre Dumas?

300
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,497
别傻了 史蒂文 是耶稣写的
Don't be daft, Steve, it was written by Jesus.

301
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,593
噢 随便啦 五个听起来顺口些
Oh. Anyway, five sounds much better.

302
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,028
我觉得他就弄三个主角有点失误
I think they missed a trick only having three.

303
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,998
如果是五个人 可以牺牲掉两个 最后还是剩下他们仨
'Cause you'd have five, then two could've died and they'd still have three left.

304
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,910
- 我们到了吗?  - 出发吧!
- Are we there yet?  - Let's do this!

305
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,962
汤龙乐队! 我记得这首歌
Soup Dragons! I remember this one.

306
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,720
我还录了盘带子给你 记得吗?
I put this on a tape for you, didn't I?

307
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,888
没错 现在放的就是
Yeah, this is it.

308
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,961
- 就是这盘带子?  - 是啊 没错! 瞧瞧
- This is the tape?  - Yeah, yeah! Look, look.

309
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,663
- 你在哪找到的?  - 一直在磁带机里啊
- Where did you find it?  - It was in the tape player.

310
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:06,663


311
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,401
噢 看那 有人饿了吗?
Oh, look. Is anyone hungry?

312
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,707
我想去尿尿
I need a piss actually.

313
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,919
他去了好久啊
This is a long piss.

314
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,715
尿的话是挺久的
If it is a piss.

315
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,284
- 也许还...  - 拉屎
- Might be a little...  - Poo.

316
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,730
怎么就成拉屎了呢?
How is that a poo?

317
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,556
- 还给你家老头子打工呢 皮特?  - 是的 我现在是合伙人了
- Still work for your old man, Pete?  - Yeah. I'm a partner now.

318
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,624
你混的怎样?
You?

319
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,728
89年创业 05年把公司卖了
Yeah, started my own firm in '98. Got bought out in '05.

320
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,470
不过开心多了 没那么大压力
I'm happier, though. It's less stress.

321
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,131
- 奥利你呢?  - 还在卖房子
- Ollie?  - Property.

322
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,668
我管伦敦北区的高档房屋中介
I co-manage a boutique estate agency in North London.

323
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,903
这行竞争很激烈
Very competitive.

324
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,839
- 还在处理家庭法相关案子吗 安迪?  - 换企业法了
- Is it family law you're in, Andy?  - Corporate.

325
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,107
有人知道加里现在做什么吗?
Does anyone know what Gary's doing?

326
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,009
他在玩极品飞车呢 就在那
He's playing Need For Speed. Over there.

327
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,345
快 快 快啊!
Come on, come on, come on!

328
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,386
他一点都没变 对吗?
He hasn't changed, has he?

329
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:59,320
我不知道 他倒是把欠我的600镑还了
I don't know. He did finally pay me back that ￡600.

330
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,589
- 真的吗? 他找我借了200镑呢  - 还有我
- Really? He borrowed ￡200 off me.  - And me.

331
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,364
我不敢相信 这种事你也做得出来!
I can't believe it. I can't believe you'd do that!

332
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,832
噢! 必须的好不好
Oh! Of course I can.

333
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,839
抢皮特的钱还给保罗
It's just robbing Peter to pay Paul.

334
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,601
错 我借皮特钱还给了你 我还欠着保罗呢
No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you. I still owe Paul.

335
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,975
噢 爽啊
Oh, shit.

336
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,683
纽顿海文
Newton Haven.

337
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:31,750
花点时间记住它原来的模样 兄弟们 今晚我们要给它改头换面了
Take a moment to look upon it in its original colors, boys, for tonight we paint it red.

338
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,335
噢 不要 不 不 不 糟糕
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

339
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,363
妈的 妈的
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

340
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,665
妈的
Fuck, fuck.

341
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,800
噢 不 没事的 我常在服务区这么干
Oh, no, it's okay, I did it all in the services.

342
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,476
知道我为什么拦你吗 先生?
Know why I pulled you over, sir?

343
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,143
音乐太吵吗?
Was the music too loud?

344
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,723
- 你左侧刹车灯坏了  - 噢!
- Your left brake light is faulty.  - Oh!

345
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,649
老掉牙的刹车灯! 难怪叫刹车灯 因为动不动就歇菜
The old brake lights! So called because they're always breaking.

346
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,993
警官 我一定会修好的
I'll get that sorted out, Officer.

347
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,292
- 能给我看看你的驾照吗 先生?  - 好的
- Can I see your license, sir?  - Yup.

348
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,690
啊!
Ah!

349
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,158
完蛋了? 在我钱包里
You know what? It's in my wallet.

350
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,994
钱包落在健身房了!
And I left that at the bloody gym!

351
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:20,632
- 有什么其他证件吗?  - 没有 都在我包里
- Any other form of identification?  - No, it's all in my sports bag.

352
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,201
这种状况挺常见的 对吗? 嗯...
That's bloody typical, isn't it? Um...

353
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,304
我把名字和地址告诉你 你能在系统里查到
I'll give you my name and address, you can run me through the old system.

354
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,340
说吧
Go on then.

355
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,474
我叫皮特・佩奇
It's Peter Page.

356
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:34,356
住在伦敦北区 48号 毕肖普花园
48 Bishop's Gardens, London, N2 T12.

357
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,118
- 天啊 加里! 搞毛线啊?  - 你干嘛说我的名字?
- Jesus, Gary! WTF?  - Why did you give him my name?

358
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,621
我又不可能告诉他我的 对吧?
I'm not gonna give him my name, am I?

359
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,088
你想让警察找我麻烦?
Suppose I get done by the police?

360
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,432
不会有警察找你的
You won't get done by the police.

361
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,434
加里 警察会发现人车对不上号!
Gary, he will check the number plate against his name!

362
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,193
我知道 所以我告诉他我是皮特啊
I know. Why do you think I gave him Pete's name?

363
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,096
天啊 加里 我有个租车行 而且刚入股
Jesus Christ, Gary, I own a car showroom. I am a junior partner.

364
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,597
真是...
This is...

365
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,702
相信我就是了
Just trust me.

366
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,036
那么 皮特先生 你为什么来纽顿海文?
So, Mr. Page, what brings you to Newton Haven?

367
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,006
我们过去都住这 回来看看风景
Well, we're all from here. We're just back to see the sights.

368
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,008
重温儿时回忆
Have a crack at the old Golden Mile.

369
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,376
也许还会捣点乱
Might get a bit messy.

370
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,544
这么说吧 首先你得保证把刹车灯修好
Well, you make sure you get that brake light fixed

371
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,151
可能还得做个尾气标准测试
and you might want to do an emissions test, too.

372
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,149
噢 还有 皮特
Oh, and, Peter.

373
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,390
记住别闹大了
Don't make too much mess.

374
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,725
不会的!
We won't!

375
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,023
嗯
Hmm.

376
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,289
我搞不懂
I don't understand.

377
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,225
很简单 皮特
It's simple, Pete.

378
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,228
从1989年起 这辆车就一直在你名下
The car's still registered to you, it has been since 1989.

379
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,663
但那以后我都搬过三次家了
But I've moved three times since then.

380
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,231
我知道 我改了记录
I know, I changed the log book.

381
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,033
不然我哪来分给警察扣?
Where do you think all those points came from?

382
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,240
天啊 大伙都放松点
Jesus. You guys need to relax.

383
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,840


384
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,786
你知道你会惹出一堆麻烦吗?
Do you know how much trouble you could get into?

385
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,454
你都不知道我已经一团糟了?
Do you know how much trouble I'm already in?

386
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,689
你这话什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

387
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,025
嘿 这究竟是怎么回事? 我们为什么来这里?
Hey. What the hell is this? Why are we even here?

388
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,628
一起全军覆没
We are here to get annihilated.

389
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,931
晚上有什么想吃的吗?
Have you got any plans for dinner at all?

390
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,867
今天晚上 我们要完成豪饮马拉松
Tonight, we will be partaking of a liquid repast

391
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,236
今天晚上酒就是我们的晚餐
as we wend our way up The Golden Mile.

392
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,006
先去一号邮局 来一大桶啤酒
Commencing with an inaugural tankard at The First Post,

393
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,176
然后去老相识 闻名雄鸡 交叉之手
then onto The Old Familiar, The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,

394
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,644
好伙伴 忠仆
The Good Companions, The Trusty Servant,

395
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,879
双头猎狗 美人鱼 蜂窝 国王之颅
The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive, The King's Head

396
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,915
然后墙洞 和上回路线一致
and The Hole in the Wall for a measure of the same.

397
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,785
直到宿命的终点站 喝光最后一滴酒
All before the last bittersweet pint in that most fateful terminus,

398
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,053
世界的尽头
The World's End.

399
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,121
为我们留盏灯 夫人
Leave a light on, good lady,

400
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,523
虽然我们回来时 眼神还透着兴奋劲
for though we may return with a twinkle in our eyes,

401
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,731
但我敢打包票 全都烂醉如泥了
we will, in truth, be blind drunk.

402
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,276


403
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,876
来吧!
Come on!

404
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,850
- 直到1840年...  - 去他妈的
- Until 1840...  - Fucking hell.

405
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,953
这里还是纽顿海文第一家邮局
this building was the site of Newton Haven's first post office.

406
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,988
一个进取的生意人发现
Until an enterprising business fellow decided that

407
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,025
相比用来收发邮件
far from befitting the sending and receiving of mail

408
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,227
这儿更适合做酒吧
it was perhaps better suited as a humble taproom

409
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,005
给疲倦的旅人歇歇脚 快进来吧
where a weary traveler might get matted. Come on.

410
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,135
啊!
Ah!

411
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,774
简直是昨日重现
It's like déjà vu.

412
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,078
我一点印象都没有 这里重装了吗?
I don't remember this at all. Has it been refurbished?

413
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,047
被连锁店收购了 对吗?
Been bought by a chain, hasn't it?

414
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,715
全国性提案的一部分
Part of that nationwide initiative to rob

415
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,629
同化那些个性的小酒吧
small, charming pubs of any discernible character.

416
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,198
好比星巴克 哥们 这种事很常见
Starbucking, man. It's happening everywhere.

417
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,290
不过 味道还和过去一样
Can't take away that smell, though.

418
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,959
我相信他们尽力了
I'm sure they tried.

419
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,863
- 晚上好 雷蒙多 浪子们回头了  - 什么?
- Good evening, Raymondo. The prodigal sons return.  - Eh?

420
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,464
今晚都有什么嘉宾?
Who's on the guest list tonight?

421
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,433
- 你说什么?  - 宾客名单
- Come again?  - The guest ales.

422
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,269
我们几个 先生 我们来重温美好时光了
We, sir, are doing The Golden Mile and you have

423
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,443
你有幸成为第一位见证者
the honor of drawing first blood.

424
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,177
- 有什么推荐的?  - 有一个还不错 至高荣耀
- What do you recommend?  - There's one. Crowning Glory.

425
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,711
- 再合适不过了  - 怎么说?
- Rather fitting.  - How's that?

426
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,612
- 我叫加里・金  - 什么?
- I'm Gary King.  - What?

427
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,914
- 多说点  - 关于什么?
- So tell me more.  - About what?

428
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,250
至高荣耀 带果仁吗? 气泡多吗? 会让人开心吗?
Crowning Glory. Is it nutty? Is it foamy? Is it happy?

429
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,986
是不是有种特殊的果味 会留香唇齿间?
Does it have a surprisingly fruity note which lingers on the tongue?

430
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,321
- 嗯 啤酒而已  - 好吧
- Hmm. It's beer.  - Hmm.

431
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,723
我们要五杯
We'll have five of those, please.

432
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,728
不 不好意思 只要四杯外加杯水 谢谢
No. Sorry. Can we have four of those and a tap water, please?

433
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,400
什么?
What?

434
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,405
不敢相信
I don't believe this,

435
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:32,082
猛男居然喝白开水
a man of your legendary prowess drinking fucking rain.

436
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,879
简直和狮子吃豆泥一样荒唐
It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus.

437
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,048
- 没道理  - 的确没道理
- That doesn't make any sense.  - I know it doesn't make any sense.

438
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,684
发生了那样的事 你还计较我不喝酒?
You seriously have a problem with me not drinking, after what happened?

439
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,320
- 我不知道 不过亚瑟王知道!  - 噢 没准有点用
- I don't, but King Arthur does!  - Oh, this'll be good.

440
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,823
亚瑟王会怎么做?
What's King Arthur got to do with it?

441
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,234
从黑斯廷斯战场归来后 你觉得亚瑟王
Do you honestly think that King Arthur came back from the Battle of Hastings,

442
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,795
- 会他妈躲进城堡...  - 卡米洛特
- fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...  - Camelot.

443
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,063
走向酒吧然后说
walked up to the bar and went,

444
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,998
"你好 给我来杯自来水?"
"Hello. Could I have a tap water?"

445
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,502
不会 在亚瑟王的时代 根本就没有自来水
No, because they didn't have running water in Arthurian times.

446
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,505
说的没错 他会要杯蜂蜜酒 亚瑟王的啤酒
Exactly. He would have had a mead. The King Arthur of beers.

447
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,679
我喝水就不是男人了吗?
And I'm less of a man because I choose to drink water?

448
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,375
的确有点娘 不是吗?
Well, it's a bit "ooh ducky", innit?

449
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,743
加里 这么说很不友好
That's not very PC, Gary.

450
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,645
别整老一套 皮特
Get out of the '90s, Pete.

451
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,648
戒酒一点也不娘
There's nothing "ooh ducky" about being teetotal,

452
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,184
尤其是在橄榄球赛结束后 走进酒吧
about walking into a pub after a rugby match

453
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,655
往脸上涂着油彩混球们中间一站 然后要一杯白开水
and ordering a tap water at a bar packed full of big ugly bastards wearing warpaint.

454
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,892
那可是需要极大自信的 朋友 我有的是胆量
That, my friend, takes confidence, yeah? I'm talking balls

455
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,566
谁信啊 傻瓜
You said it, poof.

456
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,234
我不知道你意识到没有 加里 我们已经不是小孩子了
I don't know if you're aware of this, Gary, but we are not teenagers anymore.

457
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,867
上帝是不会允许你有孩子的 因为...
And God forbid you ever have children, because if...

458
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,035
我可能有孩子
I might have kids.

459
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,538
那你最好做好负责任的准备...
Then you had better be ready to take responsibility...

460
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,242
不 我是说我可能真有孩子
No. I mean I might have kids.

461
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,786
还记得卡伦・艾格顿吗 我们睡过?
You remember Karen Eggerton, who I fucked?

462
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,713
他们家移民去诺曼底的时候 她月经迟到了两周
She was two weeks late when her parents emigrated to Normandy.

463
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,554
我和她再也没联系过了 她也许有孩子了
I never heard from her again. She might have had a baby.

464
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,230
想象一下? 法国孩子
Imagine that? A French kid.

465
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,990
简直是对牛弹琴
It's pointless arguing with you.

466
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,461
为孩子干杯 不管他们如何
To kids. Wherever they may be.

467
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,392
- 为了孩子  - 孩子
- Kids.  - Kids.

468
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,966
干杯 我们嘘嘘吧
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

469
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,630
"嘘嘘" 什么意思?
"Boo-Boo". What is that?

470
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,966
你记得 "我们嘘嘘吧"
You remember, "Let's Boo-Boo."

471
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,068
谢菲尔德先生的课 墙上写着
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's classroom, it said on the wall,

472
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,671
"快逃 熊追上来了" 还记得吗 莎士比亚的剧本?
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you know, from that Shakespeare play?

473
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,506
- 冬日絮语  - 没错 叫什么来着?
- A Winter's Tale.  - Yeah. What was it called?

474
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,841
冬日絮语 就叫这个
A Winter's Tale. That's it.

475
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,944
所以如果我们要赶紧撤 就会说 "快逃 熊追上来了"
And if we needed to make a quick getaway, we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear,"

476
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,947
后来就成了 "快逃 瑜伽熊追上来了"
and then it was, "Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear,"

477
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,881
然后是 "练练瑜伽嘘嘘吧"
and then it was just, "Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo,"

478
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,156
最后就成了 "我们嘘嘘吧"
and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."

479
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,603
- 你的意思是 我们撤?  - 没错 这就是重点 对不对?
- So you're saying we should go?  - Yeah. it's shit here, isnit?

480
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,592
啊!
Ah!

481
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,604
老相识 这才是酒吧
The Old Familiar. Now this is a pub.

482
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,838
是啊 和第一个差不多
Yes. This is more like it.

483
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,078
昨日重现
Like déjà vu.

484
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:48,613
戴维 哥们 听到消息了吗? 加里・金回镇上了
David, my man, have you heard the news? Gary King is back in town.

485
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,649
他是谁?
Who's he?

486
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,673
葬礼怎么样 加里?
How was the funeral, Gary?

487
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,306
你妈妈的葬礼?
Your mum's funeral?

488
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,474
难以用言语形容
It's difficult to put into words.

489
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:18,287
不过用三个词的话 我会说
But if I had to choose three, I would say,

490
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,687
"真的 真的 难过"
"Really, really sad."

491
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,385
噢 不 这是两个词 对不对?
Oh, no, that's two, isn't it?

492
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,292
这样吧 "真的 非常 难过"
How about, "Really, very sad"?

493
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,530
真遗憾 你妈妈很好
It's a shame, she was a good woman.

494
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,025
我真的很喜欢你妈妈
I really liked your mum.

495
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,973
我也是 伙计 我也是
Me, too, mate. Me, too.

496
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,730
- 喂  - 你好 伙计
- Hello.  - Hello, mate.

497
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,832
你到了吗?
Are you here?

498
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,835
是啊 我在这待了好久了 你说什么呢?
Yeah, I've been here for ages. What are you talking about?

499
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,846
又在环岛公路上迷路了?
You get lost on the ring road again?

500
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,505
这里是纽顿海文
This is Newton Haven.

501
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,315
- 打算几点去见双胞胎?  - 双胞胎?
- What time are you meeting The Twins?  - Twins?

502
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,047
我们在老相识 没事的话过来吧
We're all at The Old Familiar. Come by if you want.

503
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,656
没错 他也在 好的 待会见
Yeah, he is. Okay. See you soon.

504
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,188
和谁说话呢 圈仔?
Who was that, O-Man?

505
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,855
别叫我圈仔 加里 如果你非要知道的话 是山姆
Don't call me O-Man, Gary. If you must know it was Sam.

506
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:04,889
- 山姆在这?  - 山姆在这?
- Sam's here?  - Sam's here?

507
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,892
我听见回音了吗? 没错 山姆在这
Is there a fucking echo in here? Yes, Sam's here.

508
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,194
她从曼彻斯特过来 明天我们一起去妈妈那里
She's down from Manchester. We're driving to Mum's tomorrow.

509
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,429
什么 她要来这?
What, and she's coming here?

510
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,865
- 冷静点 史蒂文 我先看到她的  - 天啊 又来了
- Calm down, Steve, I saw her first.  - Jesus Christ, not this again.

511
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:17,735
开什么玩笑? 是我先看到她的
Are you fucking kidding me? I saw her first.

512
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,114
你有选择性记忆症 对吧?
You really have a selective memory, don't you?

513
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,706
是有人这么说
Somebody else was saying that.

514
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,574
- 我说的  - 不 你说的话我肯定记得
- Me.  - No. I would have remembered.

515
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,510
我告诉过你我喜欢山姆
I told you I had a thing about Sam

516
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:28,079
可一有机会你就想上她
and you proceeded to try and get in her pants at every opportunity.

517
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,147
兄弟们 拜托
Guys, please.

518
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,482
因为我喜欢她所以你才喜欢她!
You only liked her after you found out I liked her!

519
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,351
没错 因为你在学校演话剧
That's right, because you did the school play.

520
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,386
- 卡巴莱歌舞表演  - 卡巴莱 因为她也出演了
- Cabaret.  - Cabaret. Because she was in it.

521
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,322
她穿了网袜 结果你在台上硬了
And she wore those fishnet stockings and you got a big boner on stage.

522
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,490
天啊
Jesus Christ.

523
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,593
无所谓了 她随时恭候阿德里安・基恩呢
Doesn't matter anyway, she always had a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.

524
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,828
我讨厌那混蛋
I hated that prick.

525
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:48,437
能不能不要提到我妹妹 就说起
Can we not talk about my sister in relation to,

526
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,769
A 随时恭候 B 史蒂文的老二?
A, massive wide ons, B, Steven's erect penis?

527
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,271
好的
All right.

528
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,252
- 她还是前凸后翘吗 说真的?  - 我不会告诉你的
- Is she still fit, though?  - I'm not answering that.

529
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,074
她是不是呀?
Is she, though?

530
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,578
- 我是什么?  - 苗条健康
- Am I what?  - Fit.

531
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,814
- 你好 山姆  - 史蒂文? 你变化真大啊?
- Hello, Sam.  - Steven? You've grown, haven't you?

532
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,850
- 没错 横向发展  - 你看起来真棒
- Yeah, sideways.  - You look fantastic.

533
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,318
胆固醇太多
Steroids.

534
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,188
安迪 好久没见了
Andy, longtime.

535
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,822
- 你好 皮特  - 你好 山姆
- Hi, Pete.  - Hi, Sam.

536
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,824
好啦 老弟?
All right, big brother?

537
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,526
加里
Gary.

538
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,963
欢迎 欢迎 欢迎
Willkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome.

539
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,124
山姆 一起喝杯酒吗?
Sam. Would you like a drink?

540
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,067
嘿 史蒂文 她才刚到这 拜托
Hey, Steve. She's just got here. Come on.

541
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,268
山姆 一起喝杯酒吗?
Sam. Would you like a drink?

542
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,504
- 给我来杯伏特加汤力 谢谢 史蒂文  - 好的
- I'll have a vodka tonic, thanks, Steven.  - Sure.

543
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,025
- 我先去下洗手间  - 好的
- I'm just going to nip to the loo.  - Cool.

544
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,120
上厕所了
Nature calls.

545
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,850
- 你要做什么?  - 你要做什么?
- What are you doing?  - What are you doing?

546
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,831
- 我要去洗手间  - 好吧 我也是
- I'm going to the toilet.  - Well, then, so am I.

547
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,523
加里! 你疯了吗!
Gary! You are out of your mind!

548
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,969
你说什么呢? 是你先给我暗示的
What are you talking about? You gave me the sign.

549
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,799
- 什么暗示?  - 你去厕所
- What sign?  - You went to the toilet.

550
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,829
加里 你玩真的呀? 我都二十年没见你了
Gary, are you serious? I haven't seen you in 20 years.

551
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,432
你不会真以为我要在女厕所和你做爱?
Do you really think I'm going to have sex with you in the ladies' toilet?

552
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,167
好吧 残疾人用的厕所坏了
Well, the disableds is out of order.

553
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,202
- 加里 发生了什么事?  - 我不知道
- Gary. What happened?  - I don't know,

554
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,471
也许有人往马桶里扔了太多纸巾
maybe one of them put too many paper towels down the toilet.

555
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,872
实在搞不清他们究竟在想什么 对不对?
I mean, we don't know what they are thinking, really, do we?

556
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,009
不 你是怎么了?
No. What happened to you?

557
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,148
没什么
Nothing.

558
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,056
什么都没发生 我还是以前那个加里
Nothing happened to me. I'm the same old Gary.

559
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,158
- 扯淡  - 哼!
- No shit.  - Huh!

560
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,554
那么 想来一炮吗?
So, do you wanna?

561
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,954
- 奥利弗 待会见  - 你要走了?
- Oliver. I'll see you later.  - You're going?

562
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,156
我以为你半小时后才去接双胞胎呢?
I thought you weren't meeting The Twins for another half hour?

563
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,036
我改主意了 对了 这玩意应该是你的
I'm not. Oh, yeah. I believe this is yours.

564
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:30,709
"故障" 私人玩笑
"Out of order." It's a private joke.

565
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,882
我不想听
I don't want to know.

566
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,854
- 那是什么?  - 现代艺术
- What is that?  - Modern art.

567
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:50,955
纪念碑吧 对吗?
It's a memorial, isn't it?

568
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,299
没错 纪念现代艺术
Yeah. To modern art.

569
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,678
嘿 伙计们 现在是什么时间?
Hey. guys, do you know what time it is?

570
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,594
还不到六点
It's not even 6:00.

571
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,564
答错了! 是我们冲进大公鸡的时间!
Wrong! it's high time we got onto The Cock!

572
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,600
哇哦!
Whoo-hoo!

573
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,313
冲啊
Let's go.

574
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,908
走吧
Come on.

575
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,727
伙计 等你忙完了
When you're ready, mate.

576
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,024
天啊 瞧瞧那是谁
Oh, shit. Look who it is.

577
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,225
巴希尔 疯巴希尔!
Basil. Mad Basil!

578
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,791
你们还记得吗? 我们以前老来这
Do you remember? We used to come in here

579
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:31,502
听他讲关于飞碟 蜥蜴人 还有水底纳粹的鬼话
and listen to him talk about fucking UFOs and lizard people and underwater Nazis.

580
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,473
他是不是还说过百慕大三角
Didn't he spout some bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle

581
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,665
实际上是方形的?
actually being a square?

582
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,868
不 他说那其实是个两个个等腰三角形拼成的菱形
No, he said it was two isosceles triangles forming a rhombus.

583
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,170
他是你的好基友 对吗 史蒂文?
He was your best mate, wasn't he, Steve?

584
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,706
不 他不是我的好基友 加里
No, he wasn't my best mate, Gary.

585
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,908
他老无所依 我有点同情他而已
He was a lonely, old guy and I felt a bit sorry for him.

586
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,752
没错 巴希尔!
That's right. Basil!

587
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,081
也许我们在这没你想的那么有名
Maybe we're not the local legends you think we are.

588
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,749
- 加里・金?  - 说给你自己听吧
- Gary King?  - Speak for yourself, mate.

589
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,161
你被拉黑了
You're barred.

590
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,589
开什么玩笑 太可笑了
I cannot fucking believe this. This is ridiculous.

591
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,757
相信我 加里 没必要啊
Believe me, Gary, it's not worth it.

592
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,432
- 下场双倍啦  - 要我说 下场喝透算了
- Have two in the next one.  - Have them all in the next one, for all I care.

593
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,322
每家酒馆都要喝一杯 否则就不算数了
We've got to have one in every pub otherwise the whole thing's fucked.

594
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,273
伙计 我早就觉得没戏了
I'd say it was fairly fucked already, mate.

595
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:08,544
好极了
Great.

596
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,542
我们还要忍受多久啊?
How much more of this do we have to endure?

597
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,545
- 才逛了三家 还剩九家  - 哦 好极了
- That was three. There's nine more.  - Oh, good.

598
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,613
我操 我要吃点东西
Fuck that. I need to eat something.

599
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,948
下家店 我们去弄点吃的吧
We can get some food in the next pub.

600
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,983
只要那些东西吃起来健康就行了
As long as it's reasonably healthy.

601
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,486
这里是纽顿海文
This is Newton Haven.

602
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,653
估计跟有机和健康不沾边吧
Hardly the heart of the organic revolution.

603
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,355
我怀疑这里没什么跟现代搭边的
I doubt it's the heart of anything.

604
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,226
我老婆想让我吃有机食品 问题在于 我更加偏向吃垃圾食品
My wife wanted us to go organic, problem is, I kinda like eating shit.

605
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,173
下个酒吧专卖垃圾食品! 速度来!
The next pub does shit! Keep up!

606
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,734
哦 赞啊 我记得这家店
Oh, yeah. I remember this one.

607
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,908
- 跨年狂欢 不是吗?  - 90年的新年那次
- We had New Year's in here, didn't we?  - '89 into '90.

608
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,038
你是不是还在台球桌上睡着了 安迪?
Isn't that when you slept on the pool table, Andy?

609
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,109
没错 我还记得呢
Yeah. I believe it was.

610
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,617
- 足足睡了六个小时  - 六个小时啊
- For six hours.  - Six hours.

611
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,310
多亏你提醒我啊
Thank you for reminding me.

612
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,348
你还记得 你醒来的时候
Do you remember when you woke up,

613
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,717
我们骗你说 你睡了一年 现在是1991年
we said you'd been asleep for a year and that it was 1991

614
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,279
然后你被吓疯了 还把钟给打坏了?
and you freaked out and punched a clock?

615
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,560
那晚上真是赞啊
That was a great night.

616
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,632
你最后把艾瑞卡・里奇斯钓走了吗 皮特?
Didn't you manage to get off with Erika Leekes, Peter?

617
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,600
妥妥的搞定 我必须说 完全是人生的丰碑啊
Yes, I did. Something of a personal triumph, if I say so myself.

618
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,629
- 她是那个甜心三明治的那个?  - 甜心三明治...
- She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?  - Marmalade Sandwich...

619
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,631
真像啊
The very same.

620
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,568
两个金发妞 夹着一个红发小魔女
Two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

621
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,604
- 甜心三明治  - 贝奇・索特 那身材啊
- The Marmalade Sandwich.  - Becky Salt. Fucking hell.

622
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,839
不知道她们现在在做什么?
Wonder what they're doing now.

623
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,040
干嘛不直接问她们呢?
Why don't you ask them?

624
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,076
什么意思?
What do you mean?

625
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:27,745
我说 那边卡间里 两边金发 中间红发
I mean, sitting at that table over there are two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

626
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,113
真他妈见鬼
Shut the fuck up.

627
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,449
我猜左边是艾瑞卡・里奇斯 右边是崔西・本森
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the left, Tracy Benson on the right,

628
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,517
剩下的 中间肯定是贝奇・索特
and by process of elimination, there's Becky Salt in the middle.

629
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,453
甜心三明治都成熟了啊
That's the Marmalade Sandwich all growed up.

630
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,188
感觉好怪啊
That is very spooky.

631
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,889
- 我们把她们叫过来啦  - 别啊
- We should get them over.  - No.

632
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,424
不要破坏了过去的美好啊
Leave the past where it is.

633
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,092
看着你这张皱巴巴的臭脸就很扫兴了
It's bad enough having to look at your old, ugly mugs.

634
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,562
你这话说的 好像我们快入土的感觉
You make it sound like we're fucking ancient.

635
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,596
我们才没有变多少呢
We haven't changed that much.

636
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,832
- 当然啦 史蒂文身材是走样了一点  - 什么?
- I mean, sure, Steve's let himself go a bit.  - What?

637
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,601
皮特的发型还是那么挫 奥利弗那鬼记号还在
Pete's got the same haircut and Oliver has still got his mark of the devil.

638
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,869
- 奇怪 记号不见了  - 的确不见了
- No, he hasn't.  - No, he hasn't.

639
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,103
有个东西叫做激光手术 加里
It's called laser surgery, Gary.

640
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,673
为了不被叫圈仔 这代价完全忽略不计
It's a small price to pay for not being called fucking O-Man.

641
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,374
这手术也能除纹身 比如你身上的仁慈姐妹
That works for Sisters of Mercy tattoos as well.

642
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,752
我可喜欢这纹身了
I still like the Sisters Of Mercy.

643
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,151
那好的吧 你就别想游泳了
Well, good job, or you'd never go swimming.

644
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,545
- 我不懂你说什么  - 少装傻
- I'm lost.  - Don't be.

645
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,288
我代表我自己 很高兴再看到你们这群老家伙啊
Well, I for one, think it's nice to see the old faces again.

646
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,451
多谢啦 伙计
Cheers, mate.

647
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,095
不好意思? 这位置有人坐吗?
Excuse me? This taken?

648
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,460
这位置有人坐吗?
Is this seat taken?

649
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,227
拿去吧 伙计
Have it, mate.

650
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,660
谢啦
Thanks.

651
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,197
那不是... 尚恩・霍金
Wasn't that... Shane Hawkins.

652
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,032
- 话说 他不是...  - 没错 是的
- Hey, didn't he...  - Yes, he did.

653
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,268
等等 尚恩・霍金又怎么了?
Hang on. What happened with Shane Hawkins again?

654
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,681
没事的话 我还是不说的好
I'd rather not bring it all up again, if that's okay.

655
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,440
伙计 皮特 听着
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.

656
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,208
把童年的阴影深埋在心里
Bottling up past trauma can lead to

657
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,512
会对未来的生活造成很大的影响 真的
inadequate coping strategies in later life, apparently

658
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,947
我也不知道 倒不是为了过去的事情
I don't know, I mean, it's not even about the past, you know.

659
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,150
不是因为上学他欺负我
It's not about the fact that he bullied me,

660
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,597
他害我请假比出水痘请假还多
that he made me miss more school days than chicken pox.

661
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,224
也不是因为他强迫我整节课躲在厕所蹲坑间里
It's not even that he forced me to spend entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle,

662
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,600
也不是因为他打我打到我眼球移位
or that he punched me so hard he dislodged my eyeball.

663
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,742
也不是因为他毁了我的童年生活
And it's not even that he ruined a large portion of my childhood.

664
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,108
都不是 只是因为就刚刚 他竟然认不出我了
No, it's the fact that just then, he didn't recognize me.

665
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,340
他直直地看着我 就好像之前他完全没这么对我过一样
He looked straight through me like it all meant nothing.

666
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,608
这听起来很奇怪 是吧?
That probably sounds weird, doesn't it?

667
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,110
干了!
Shots!

668
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:09,285
大 家 干 了 干杯
S-H-O-T-S. Shots.

669
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,620
你在干什么 加里?
What are you doing, Gary?

670
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,829
我以为这很明显啊 喝酒啊
I thought it was obvious. Shots.

671
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,552
首先 皮特刚刚在说的事情
Firstly, Peter was talking about something

672
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,986
很明显让他觉得很不开心的
which clearly made him feel very uncomfortable.

673
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,160
- 没事 安迪  - 错了 皮特 怎么可能没事
- It's all right, Andy.  - No, Peter, it's not all right.

674
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,200
其次 十二杯酒完全超量了 最后 我戒酒了啊!
Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough, and thirdly, I don't fucking drink!

675
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,396
但烈酒不算的 对吧?
But shots don't count, do they?

676
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,164
你说 你想跟我们聊天叙旧 放松放松
You said you wanted to catch up and chew the fat.

677
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,008
我觉得你就是想喝酒
I think you just wanted to drink it.

678
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,568
我们连你的朋友都不是
We're not here as your friends.

679
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,242
我们变成你的酒友了啊
We're just your fucking enablers.

680
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,905
酒友 这词好喜感 不是吗? 酒友
Enablers. That's a funny word, isn't it? Enabler.

681
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,640
加里・金及他的酒友们
Gary King And The Enablers.

682
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,309
这个做乐队的名字正好 史蒂文 记得记下来啊
That's a good name for a band, Steve. Write that down.

683
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,550
别跟加里一样 加里
Don't do a Gary, Gary.

684
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,679
- 哦 现在还有这说法了 啊?  - 这说法一直都有
- Oh, is that a thing now, is it?  - It's always been a thing.

685
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,414
你完全不用我们来灌你
You don't need us to help you get fucked up,

686
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,191
你自己一个人妥妥的可以把自己灌死
you've done a perfectly good job so far on your own.

687
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,320
我要去查查有没有回伦敦的公车
I'm gonna go and see if there's a bus back to London

688
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,654
有人要跟我一起回去吗
if anyone wants to come with me.

689
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,525
你不能走 这次很特别的 这可是我们的纪念日
You can't go. This is special. This is our anniversary.

690
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,926
这不是什么纪念日 加里
It's not the anniversary, Gary.

691
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,561
上次我们是六月 现在十月了
We did this in June. It's October.

692
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,363
没错 但今年是纪念日那年 对吧?
Yeah, but it's the anniversary of the year, isn't it?

693
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,265
每年都是纪念日的一年
Every year is the anniversary of a year!

694
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,007
如今不同往日了 加里
It's just not the same anymore, Gary,

695
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,512
不是这镇子变了 是我们变了
and it's not that the town's changed, we have changed.

696
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,412
好吧 但你也走不了了 因为公车最后一班刚刚开走
Yeah, well, you can't go, 'cause the buses are finished.

697
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,442
那我回家居旅馆了 你来吗?
Then I'm gonna go back to the B&B. You coming?

698
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,610
早点睡对我来说也不错的
I could do with an early one actually.

699
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,011
我应该去出发找山姆了
I should probably go and find Sam.

700
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,732
是吧 我跟奥利弗一起去找山姆
Yeah, I'm gonna go and find Sam with Oliver.

701
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,086
那就这么定了 行吗?
That's settled then, yeah?

702
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,190
你们知道我怎么想吗? 我觉得你们是在嫉妒我
You know what I think? I think you're jealous.

703
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:26,358
没错 你们是有房有车有老婆有工作
Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars and your wives and your job security.

704
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,630
但你们没有我的有的东西 自由
But you don't have what I have. Freedom.

705
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:34,038
你们是生活的奴隶 而我是自己的主人 跟以前一样
You're all slaves and I'm free to do what I want any old time.

706
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,977
这就是你想要的吗?
And this is what you want?

707
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,542
你好快点长大了 伙计 闯荡一下社会
You should grow up, mate. Join society.

708
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,079
是啊 但我妈妈刚去世
Yeah, but Mum died.

709
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:45,586
我们都恨遗憾 但现在是时候回家了
And we're all very sorry, but now it's time to go home.

710
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,590
我以为我们已经回家了
I thought we were home.

711
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,535
我都为他感到遗憾啊
I can't help feeling sorry for him.

712
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,274
混账
Don't.

713
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,817
哦! 操! 尿! 我操...
Oh! Fuck! Piss! Fuck...

714
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,236
当心 有人尿在地板上了
Careful, the floors a bit pissy.

715
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,894
不是我干的
Wasn't me.

716
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,274
那砖倒是我干的
That was me.

717
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,175
90年的时候干的
Did that back in '90.

718
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,283
1990年的战绩
1990.

719
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,975
把这墙打的一个洞啊
Punched the shit out of the wall.

720
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,549
我不知道为什么 但那时候感觉很爽
I don't know why. Seemed important at the time.

721
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:02,119
你们看上去玩得很开心的样子
You guys look like you're having a good night, though.

722
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,101
我们正在进行豪饮马拉松 你要不一起来啊?
I'm doing The Golden Mile tonight. You want to tag along?

723
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,967
我们可以组成六个火枪手的
We'll be like The Six Musketeers.

724
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,470
我说我们正在进行豪饮马拉松
I said we're doing The Golden Mile.

725
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,612
你用不用这么酷啊 啊?
You think you're so cool, don't you?

726
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:21,306
啊?
Huh?

727
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,474
但我们更酷
But we were cooler.

728
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,209
我们罩着这镇子的
We owned this town.

729
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,747
我们给你们铺了路 留了线索
We paved the way for you lot. Blazed a trail.

730
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,047
嘿! 跟你说话呢 看着我!
Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you!

731
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,119
- 请别这样  - 别这么样?
- Please don't.  - Don't what?

732
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:33,917
最好别这么做
You don't want to do that.

733
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,556
是吗?
Don't I?

734
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,683
什么?
What?

735
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,623
你现在给我好好解释一下!
You need to explain this right now!

736
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,891
安迪 这小子刚刚打我了
Andy, this kid just attacked me.

737
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:14,958
你少给我转移话题!
Don't you dare change the subject!

738
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,994
他按着我的头撞玻璃
He smashed my head in the mirror.

739
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,629
你知道我刚刚跟谁通话了吗? 你妈!
You know who I just spoke to? Your mum!

740
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,265
不是地狱打来的 是从博纳矛斯
And not from the afterlife. From fucking Bournemouth.

741
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,399
是真的吗?
Is that real?

742
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,934
她说 她已经八个月没跟你说过话了
She says she hasn't spoken to you for eight months.

743
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,437
- 安迪...  - 他的头就这么掉下来了!
- Andy...  - His head just came off!

744
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,038
想都别想 加里 你这次不可能糊弄过关了
No, Gary, you are not gonna wriggle out of it this time.

745
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,238
见他妈鬼
WTF

746
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,293
这坑有人占了
There's someone in here.

747
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,998
安迪 你看到...
Andy, did you see...

748
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:08,999
见鬼 加里 什么情况
WTF, Gary. WTF.

749
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,072
什么情况是什么意思啊?
What the fuck does "WTF" mean?

750
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,713
- 什么意思的意思  - 哦 懂了
- What the fuck?  - Oh, yeah.

751
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,240
这是开玩笑的吧 是吧?
This can't be happening. Can it?

752
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,362
你说呢 伙计
You said it, mate.

753
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,210
难以置信啊
I can't believe it.

754
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,411
懂的 伙计
I know, mate.

755
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,323
我不敢相信 你骗我们你妈妈的事情!
I can't believe you lied about your mum!

756
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,548
那无伤大雅!
That was a white lie!

757
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,117
- 怎么无伤大雅啊?  - 她不是没死吗 不是吗?
- How is that a white lie?  - She's not dead, is she?

758
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,322
等等 等等! 你去哪里?
Wait, wait, wait! Where are you going?

759
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,200
- 去找帮手啊  - 别 先别声张!
- To get help.  - No, don't do that!

760
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,566
- 什么 别去找帮手?  - 我们还不知道是什么情况呢
- What, don't get help?  - We don't know how far this goes.

761
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,129
- 等等 你打给谁呢?  - 维尼萨
- Wait, who are you calling?  - Vanessa.

762
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,230
- 谁是维尼萨?  - 我老婆
- Who's Vanessa?  - My wife.

763
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,065
- 为什么你要打给你老婆?  - 因为她是我老婆
- Why are you calling your wife?  - Because she's my wife.

764
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,667
你刚刚说 我们不知道是什么情况
You just said we don't know how far this goes.

765
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,303
- 我只是想说酒吧的事情  - 哦 你觉得是酒吧活动啊
- I was just thinking about the pub.  - Oh, well, there's a surprise.

766
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,704
我打不通
I can't get through.

767
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,905
你能打通山姆吗?
Can you get through to Sam?

768
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,607
我信号满格 但我也打不通
I've got full bars and I'm not getting through.

769
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:56,446
不好意思 您的电话现在无法接通
I'm sorry, your call cannot be connected at this time.

770
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,858
肯定是网络的问题
Must be the network.

771
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:02,294
该死的 这一切都是有联系的
Holy shit. This is all connected.

772
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,829
这就解释了 为什么所有事情都变样了
This explains why everything's gone fuck up.

773
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,324
因为每个人都被这种东西调包了
Everybody's been replaced by one of these.

774
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:10,761
所以他们都不认识我们 比如巴希尔 戴维 雷蒙多
That's why no one recognized us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.

775
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,397
- 我早就觉得奇怪了  - 还有尚恩・霍金
- I thought it was weird.  - Shane Hawkins.

776
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:17,367
对的 不是我们变了 是这镇子变了
Exactly. it's not us that's changed, it's the town.

777
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,469
我没说错 对吧 安迪?
I'm right, aren't I, Andy?

778
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,838
- 安迪 我说的对吧?  - 你从来没错过
- Andy, aren't I right?  - You're never wrong.

779
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,343
的确 不管发生了什么 我们不能总躲在厕所里
No, whatever the fuck's happening, we can't stay in the gents forever.

780
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,319
过去五分钟里 这厕所进了十个人
Ten people have entered this toilet in the last five minutes

781
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,112
还没有一个人出这厕所门
and not a single one has come back out again.

782
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,524
这情况很容易让人怀疑的
That's going to look suspicious.

783
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,059
搞基
Gay loving.

784
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,159
这比五具残尸还糟糕
And that's worse than five dismembered bodies.

785
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,787
这里可是纽顿海文
This is Newton Haven.

786
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:51,473
- 看上去怎么样?  - 正常 很正常
- How's it looking?  - Normal. Very normal.

787
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,646
我不喜欢这气氛
I don't like it.

788
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,251
- 我们怎么办?  - 先把酒喝了呗
- What do we do?  - Let's finish our drinks.

789
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,588
要我说 我们一口干 然后速度的离开这里
I say we neck these and get the fuck out of here.

790
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,989
- 去伦敦?  - 去忠仆
- To London?  - To The Trusty Servant.

791
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,163
- 你搞笑吧?  - 哦 我错了
- Are you fucking kidding?  - Oh, yeah.

792
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,528
下场是去好伙伴 我总是把这两个搞混
It's The Good Companions next. I always mix those two up.

793
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,363
你提议我们去下个酒吧?
Are you saying we move on to the next pub?

794
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,401
我们应该开上野兽 然后直奔伦敦
We should get in The Beast and head back to London!

795
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,877
- 我刹车灯坏了  - 那就别刹车啊!
- My brake light is broken.  - So don't use the brakes!

796
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,070
- 我早就醉酒了  - 你之前醉酒不也照开的吗?
- I'm way over the limit.  - When has that ever stopped you?

797
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,847
我不想再让皮特的驾照扣分了
I don't want to put any more points on Pete's license.

798
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,509
安迪能开 他滴酒未沾!
Andy can drive, he's teetotal!

799
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,088
啊!
Ah!

800
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,490
那就这么定了
That's settles it then.

801
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,692
我们最不希望的 就是被警察拦住
The last thing we need to do is get pulled over by the police.

802
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:49,993
首先 我们都喝酒了
A, we're all drunk,

803
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,863
其次 他们可能被调包 最后 我们手上都是血
B, they might be in on it and, C, we've got blood on our hands.

804
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,065
- 更像是墨水  - 我们手上都是墨水
- It's more like ink.  - We've got ink on our hands.

805
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,835
- 那么 看起来还没造成什么乱子嘛?  - 什么?
- So, has it got messy yet?  - What?

806
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,817
- 怎么样 逛了五家了?  - 才四家
- What are you, five pubs in?  - Four.

807
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,687
哦 还没过一半啊 接下去乐子好多着呢
Oh, not even halfway. Plenty more fun to be had.

808
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,355
玩的开心啊 皮特
Enjoy your night, Peter.

809
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,549
多谢
Thank you.

810
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:12,556
谢谢
Thank you.

811
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,087
不好意思
Sorry.

812
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,322
我觉得 我们跟所有人都说过了我们在豪饮马拉松
The way I see it, we've told everybody we were doing The Golden Mile.

813
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,390
只有你说了
You did.

814
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,159
如果我们突然跳上野兽 回头走人的话
If we suddenly jump in The Beast now and head for the hills,

815
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,493
他们就知道 我们知道了
they're gonna know that we know,

816
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,729
但是如果我们继续按照预定计划的话
but if we keep doing what we're doing and going where we're going,

817
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,796
他们就不会知道了
then they're not gonna know.

818
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,998
- 知道什么?  - 我们知道的事情
- Know what?  - That we know.

819
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,502
我建议 我们把事情办完 然后明早安静地离开
I suggest we finish what we started and leave quietly in the morning.

820
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,878
- 等等 那你是建议...  - 我们继续完成豪饮马拉松
- Wait. You're really suggesting...  - We finish The Golden Mile.

821
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,509
跟他说就是对牛弹琴
It's pointless arguing with him.

822
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,251
干了这杯 我们走人
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

823
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,286
我们只是五个朋友
We're just five friends

824
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:49,223
晚上出来逛逛 找些乐子
on a night out, having a good time.

825
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,750
- 喝酒  - 啊!
- Drinking.  - Ah!

826
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,151
- 啤酒  - 酒吧
- Beer.  - Pubs.

827
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,426
下一家?
Shall we?

828
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,994
喝这么多 我觉得有点不舒服
I feel a little uncomfortable drinking this much.

829
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,029
酒壮怂人胆 不是吗?
It's like Dutch courage, isn't it?

830
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,798
以前英国士兵经常杀敌之前喝荷兰的金酒
You know, when the English soldiers used to drink Dutch gin before battle

831
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,200
这会给他们非凡的勇气
to give them super strength.

832
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,736
我觉得 那是为了削弱害怕的负面影响
You know, I thought that was to numb the sense of impending doom.

833
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:13,837
完全正确
Exactly.

834
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,876
我们就是五个好朋友 晚上出来逛逛 找些乐子
We're just five friends on a night out, having a good time.

835
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,063
我要去厕所
I need the toilet.

836
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,932
- 去吧 应该的  - 啊?
- Go on then. You've earned it.  - Huh?

837
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,106
你进步很多啊 奥利弗
You're doing really good, Oliver.

838
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,907
上次他可没这么持久 我为他骄傲
He didn't make it this far last time. I'm proud of him.

839
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,007
你很享受现在 是吗?
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

840
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,511
是啊 五个伙计大晚上一起出来 找乐子
Yeah, five guys on a night out, having a great time.

841
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:55,090
假装在找乐子
Pretending to have a great time.

842
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,413
你是在装吗?
Are you pretending?

843
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,115
如果我们活着出去 我就把你干掉
If we get out of here alive, I'm going to kill you.

844
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,784
别人还蒙在鼓里呢 加里
We're still in the dark, Gary.

845
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:03,391
是啊 我们的家人可能都受到威胁了
Yeah, our families could be in danger for all we know.

846
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,400
我知道 我老妈这次可能真的要死了
I know, my mum could be dead. For reals this time.

847
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,538
- 嘿 为什么我们不问问其他人呢?  - 问谁啊?
- Hey, why don't we just ask somebody?  - Who?

848
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,805
- 就问绿圣人 跟上  - 等等
- The Reverend Green. Come on.  - Wait.

849
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,734
你要去干嘛?
What the fuck are you doing?

850
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,682
我过去跟绿圣人私下聊聊
I'm going to go and have a little chat with The Reverend Green.

851
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:22,444
你是要去买毒品吗?
You're going to buy drugs?

852
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,917
我就过去旁敲侧击地打探一下他是不是绿圣人
I am going to go over there and subtly check if that is The Reverend Green

853
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,045
如果是的话 我就能问他怎么回事了
and if it is, I can ask him what's going on,

854
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,548
也许顺便买点毒品
and possibly buy some drugs.

855
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,515
但如果他也是其中一员吗?
But what if he's one of them?

856
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,718
不可能 我和圣人谈起买大麻的时候
No, me and The Reverend had a highly sophisticated code

857
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,639
有个很复杂的暗号
when discussing the purchase of herbal narcotics.

858
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,064
如果他不懂的话 那就说明他是其中一员 那我就走开好了
If he doesn't understand me, it means he's one of them and I will simply walk away.

859
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,426
啊!
Ah!

860
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,434
- 还有大麻吗?  - 早就不干了 加里
- Have you got any drugs?  - I don't do that anymore, Gary.

861
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,436
- 做什么?  - 这暗号
- Do what?  - That.

862
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,804
所以你穿西装打领带了 是吗?
That why you're in a suit, is it?

863
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,639
因为贩毒不能满足你了吗?
'Cause drug dealing is not good enough for you?

864
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,808
这里没人贩毒了 加里
There are no drug dealers anymore, Gary.

865
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,710
我现在在固定地点 上固定的班
I've got a proper job in a proper office.

866
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,313
- 你还有固定地点上班  - 那可是男洗手间
- You had a proper office.  - That was the gents' toilets.

867
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,482
你以前本来就在洗手间干营生
Nothing wrong with doing your business in the toilet.

868
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,123
- 听着 你走了之后 很多事情都改变了  - 我知道
- Look, a lot has changed since you have left.  - I know.

869
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,322
- 你知道多少?  - 就一点
- How much do you?  - A little.

870
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:11,660
一点是多少?
How much is a little?

871
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,790
镇子被一群蓝墨水机器人给占领了
The town has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff.

872
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,958
嘘 小声点
Shh. Keep your voice down.

873
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,326
你知道自己在说什么吗
You don't even know what you're talking about.

874
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,795
- 那告诉我们  - 他们不是机器人
- Tell us then.  - Well, they're not robots.

875
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,730
你知道机器人是什么吗?
Do you even know what robot means?

876
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,474
我当然知道啦 像这样"你好 我是个机器人"
Course I do. It's like, "Hello, I am a robot."

877
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:28,271
是奴隶的意思 而且相信我 他们不是什么奴隶
It means slave and believe me, they are not slaves.

878
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,473
- 你变成他们的囚犯了?  - 没有 我很开心
- Are you their prisoner?  - No, I am very happy.

879
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,646
说谎注意表情啊
Tell your face.

880
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,010
嘿! 怎么样了?
Hey! What's going on?

881
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,012
这个小镇被自称不是机器人的机器人占领了
The town's been invaded by robots who aren't robots

882
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,924
- 他是他们的囚犯  - 我不是
- and The Rev's their prisoner.  - I am not.

883
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,827
我们马上就走了 我们能帮你逃出去
We're leaving first thing. We can get you out of here.

884
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,987
我不会走的 这里也不是你们想的那样 这对我们大家都好
I'm not going. It's not what you think. This is for all our benefit.

885
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:47,458
- 你说太多了 特拉沃尔  - 对 该停了 特拉沃尔
- You've said too much, Trevor.  - Yeah, put a cork in it, Trevor.

886
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,826
- 我只是想帮忙  - 这里不该由你来帮忙
- I'm just trying to help.  - It's not your place to help.

887
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,494
他们最后会知道一切的
They will have everything in hand.

888
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,530
你们是机器人吗?
Are you guys robots?

889
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,041
机器人这个词实际上起源于一个古老的捷克词语...
Well, the word robot actually comes from an old Czech word...

890
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,645
- 机器...  - 意思是奴隶
- robotnik...  - meaning slave.

891
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,702
- 我们不是奴隶  - 我们过得非常非常开心
- And we are not slaves.  - We are very, very happy.

892
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:00,909
所以我们不是机器人
And not robots.

893
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,505
天啊 这些人是机器人吗?
Oh, my God, are these guys robots?

894
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,706
别再谈机器人了!
Shut up about robots!

895
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,375
我说我们什么都别再谈了!
I say we shut up about everything!

896
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,354
特拉沃尔
Trevor.

897
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,132
是你的监督人
It's your supervisor.

898
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,961
- 你好 特拉沃尔  - 你好 先生
- Hello, Trevor.  - Hello, sir.

899
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,767
但...
But...

900
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,042
我明白
I understand.

901
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:51,365
太感谢你们了
Thanks a bunch.

902
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,039
我错过了什么?
What did I miss?

903
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,164
你的朋友们想帮忙
Your friends trying to help.

904
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,439
我们不需要你们的帮忙
We don't need your help.

905
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:03,874
那我们该做什么?
Well, what should we do?

906
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,608
我建议你们该干什么就干什么
I suggest you get on your way.

907
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,248
我觉得我们应该听他的
I think we should do what he says.

908
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,419
好吧
Okay.

909
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,990
双头狗

910
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,324
我们走吧
Here we go.

911
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,790
- 来吧!  - 加里
- Come on!  - Gary.

912
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,192
加里!
Gary!

913
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,361
我们进去就马上出来 怎样?
Let's just get in and out of this one, yeah?

914
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,103
不要再交新朋友了
No more making new friends.

915
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,133
先生们! 浪子回归了!
Gentlemen! The prodigal sons return!

916
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,081
要点什么呢 不如来点啤酒?
What will it be, one of our guest ales perchance?

917
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,873
我推荐来五杯至高荣耀啤酒 如何?
Might I recommend five pints of Crowning Glory?

918
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,910
- 非常合适 你觉得呢 加里?  - 什么? 不好意思 你说什么?
- Rather fitting, wouldn't you say, Gary?  - What? Sorry. What?

919
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,046
精心酿造 口感跳脱 令人迷醉 泡沫丰富
It's a delightful brew. Hoppy, nutty, foamy,

920
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,187
喝完是不是还会在舌尖留下水果的味道?
Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue?

921
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,930
您一看就是个行家
You're obviously a connoisseur.

922
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,987
那您肯定知道能喝到这种啤酒很难得
Then you'll already know that it's a rare treat

923
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,991
仅供流氓 传教士 皇室成员和其他好人
for rogues, reverends, royalty and all good folks between.

924
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,626
那就来五杯
Five of those, please.

925
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,573
欢迎回家 孩子们
Welcome home, boys.

926
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,801
我都不记得他会这么友好
I don't remember him being that friendly.

927
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,180
他显然是他们中的一员
He's obviously one of them.

928
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,905
他怎么可能? 他记得我
How can he be? He remembered me.

929
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,373
我们不知道他们记得什么
We don't know what they remember.

930
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,819
可能他们有选择性记忆
Maybe they have selective memories.

931
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,877
没错 就像 他的名字是什么? 我
Yeah, like what's his name? Me.

932
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,812
可能他是其他人中的一员 像老圣人
Maybe he's one of the others. Like The Reverend.

933
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,156
这很难分辨 对吧?
It is very hard to tell, isn't it?

934
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,249
对 我是说 他是他们中的一个还是他们中的一个?
Yeah, I mean, is he one of them or is he one of them?

935
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,084
等等 等等 他们是哪个他们?
Wait, wait, which ones are the thems again?

936
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,359
有两个他们 对吧?
Well, they're both thems, aren't they?

937
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,720
有两种方法来说
But there's two ways of saying it.

938
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,855
他是他们中的一个还是他们中的一个?
Is he one of them or is he one of them?

939
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,157
我们要用不同的名称
We need different terms.

940
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:38,129
一个指代不是机器人的人 还有一个指代自称不是机器人的机器人
One for the people who aren't robots and one for the robots who aren't robots.

941
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:44,404
好吧 我们得能区分他们 他们和我们
All right, we need to be able to differentiate between them, them and us.

942
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,436
对 我觉得代词真的很难区分
Yeah, I think the pronouns are really confusing.

943
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,438
对 我甚至都不知道代词是什么意思
Yes. I don't even know what a pronoun is.

944
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,506
代词自身能起到名词的作用
It's a word that can function by itself as a noun

945
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,175
但在语境中指代其他东西
which refers to something else in the discourse.

946
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:53,519
- 我没听懂它  - 你刚刚就用了一个
- I don't get it.  - You just used one.

947
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,011
- 是吗?  - 用了 "它"就是个代词
- Did I?  - Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.

948
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,045
- 哪个词?  - 它
- What is?  - It.

949
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,113
- 是它?  - 神啊
- Is it?  - Christ.

950
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,983
听着 我们只是要找他妈的一个词而已 只要分辨谁是谁就行了
Look, we just need a fucking word so we can identify who's who.

951
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:04,763
他是空壳 她是空壳 那两个人肯定也是空壳
He's a blank, she's a blank, those two people are definitely blanks.

952
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,668
山姆
Sam.

953
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,271
我来 史蒂文
I got this, Steve.

954
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,909
- 你好吗 山姆?  - 神经病
- All right, Sam?  - Oh, crumbs.

955
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,166
今晚过得怎么样?
How's your night going?

956
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,511
挺好的 基本还不错
Good. Sort of.

957
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,239
"基本"是什么意思?
What do you mean "sort of"?

958
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,952
真奇怪 不是吗?
Well, it's weird, isn't it?

959
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:30,149
你回来后发现一切都没变 都又有点不同
You come back and everything's the same, but sort of different.

960
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,850
怎么不同了?
Different how?

961
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,528
就是很奇怪
Just weird.

962
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,096
怎么奇怪了?
How weird?

963
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:36,954
你想知道什么 加里?
What are you getting at, Gary?

964
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,566
跟我来
Come with me.

965
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,500
残疾人洗手间

966
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,892
去你妹的 加里 我没给你什么暗示
Puck's sake, Gary, take a hint.

967
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,293
没关系 我不是要和你做爱
It's all right, I'm not trying to have sex with you.

968
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,762
那我们为什么跑到残疾人洗手间里?
Why are we in the disabled toilets then?

969
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,030
现在我要告诉你一些事
There's something I need to tell you right now,

970
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,331
除非你确实想做爱
unless you do want to have sex,

971
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,432
那样的话 我们先做爱我再告诉你
in which case I'll tell you afterwards.

972
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,434
现在就告诉我吧
Tell me right now.

973
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,934
你有没有发现那对双胞胎有些惊悚的地方
Have you noticed anything creepy about The Twins

974
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,069
除了她们是双胞胎这个事实之外?
apart from the fact that they're twins?

975
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,505
她们是双胞胎不意味着她们很惊悚
Just because they're twins doesn't automatically make them creepy.

976
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,240
- 不 确实会有点惊悚  - 你和她们上床了
- It does a little bit.  - You had sex with them.

977
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,620
第一 我没有 第二 你怎么知道的?
A, I did not, and, B, how did you know about that?

978
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,613
第一 这个镇子很小 第二 我不蠢 第三 她们告诉我的
A, it's a small town, B, I'm not stupid and, C, they told me.

979
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,448
好吧 我们确实睡过一次 但我快累死了
Right. Well, I did once, but I was wasted,

980
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,350
令人惊悚的就是那时好像有四个人在干我一样
which was creepy because it was like there was four of them.

981
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,951
我一点都不骄傲 事实上我确实有点骄傲
I am not proud of it. I am a bit.

982
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,587
- 这就是你想告诉我的?  - 不 这是...
- Is this what you wanted to tell me?  - No, this is...

983
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,111


984
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:15,997
- 你还好吗 山姆?  - 你还好吧 山姆?
- Are you okay, Sam?  - Are you okay, Sam?

985
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,605
我想抽根烟
I need a cigarette.

986
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,130
- 机器鬼?  - 机器假人怎么样?
- Nobots?  - How about Fauxbots?

987
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,166
我觉得我们应该彻底撇开这些机器人的问题
I think we should get away from the whole robots thing.

988
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,271
史蒂文?
Steven?

989
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:25,907
他去干什么?
What's he up to?

990
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,472
别担心 他可能是想去上奥利弗的妹妹
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just trying to fuck Oliver's sister.

991
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:30,474
安迪
Andy.

992
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:33,949
天啊 那个人就是个渣
Oh, my God, that man is full of shit.

993
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,846
我知道这不会让你们惊讶
I know that's not a surprise to you.

994
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,793
- 他说什么了 山姆?  - 他说什么了 山姆?
- What did he say, Sam?  - What did he say, Sam?

995
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:44,295
他说牛顿海文被机器人占领了 机器人里都是蓝色的东西
He said that Newton Haven has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff

996
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,989
如果我们不按照他们说的做 他们就会把我们变成奴隶
and if we don't do what they say, they will make us their prisoners.

997
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,628
- 你相信他吗?  - 你相信他吗?
- Did you believe him?  - Did you believe him?

998
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,166
不信 当然不信
No, of course not.

999
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,173
- 你相信他吗?  - 你相信他吗?
- Did you believe him?  - Did you believe him?

1000
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,433
什么?
What?

1001
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,881
- 看到了吗?  - 别信他 山姆
- See?  - Come on, Sam.

1002
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,862
你不会蠢到去相信加里・金的
You know better than to believe Gary King,

1003
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,520
神经病
Oh, crumbs.

1004
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,033
山姆!
Sam!

1005
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,406
天啊! 你们这两个疯婆娘 放手!
God! You creepy bitches, get off!

1006
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,151
给我根烟
Chuck us a ciggie.

1007
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,519
哦
Oh.

1008
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,790
加里 发生了什么?
Gary, what's happening?

1009
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,397
- 我在残疾人厕所告诉过你了  - 哦 对 你说过
- I told you in the disableds.  - Oh, yes, you did.

1010
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,867
我们进去吧 嗯?
We should get inside, eh?

1011
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,803
不然就会有人来问他妈的出什么事了
Otherwise people are going to ask what the hell's going on.

1012
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:02,198
他妈的出什么事了?
What the hell's going on?

1013
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,599
- 史蒂文 我发现了  - 发现什么了?
- Steve, I got this.  - Got what?

1014
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,935
山姆 他配不上你
Sam, he's not good enough for you.

1015
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,003
- 什么?  - 什么?
- What?  - What?

1016
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,644
我们今晚经历了很多疯狂的事
We've been through some crazy shit tonight

1017
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,709
这让我明白了一些事
and it's really put things in perspective for me,

1018
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,125
如果一切都像看上去那样神经 那么我要告诉你一些事
and if everything is as fucked up as it seems, then there's something I need to tell you.

1019
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:23,152
你可能会认为是因为我喝了七杯酒的关系 但不是的
You might think this is because I've had seven pints, but it's not.

1020
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,154
不是的
It's not.

1021
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,526
我爱你 山姆
I'm in love with you, Sam.

1022
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,392
我一直都爱你
I always have been,

1023
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,995
看到你把情感浪费在他妈的加里・金上 我很伤心
and it breaks my heart to see you waste your affections on Gary fucking King.

1024
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,636
- 嘿 那么说有点难听  - 哦 不 你搞错了
- Hey, that's a bit harsh.  - Oh, no, you've got it all wrong.

1025
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,934
- 没发生什么...  - 让我坦白告诉你
- There's nothing between...  - And while I'm being honest,

1026
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:41,838
把所有都摊开来说 我正在和一个健身教练谈恋爱
just to lay it all out there, I am currently seeing a fitness instructor.

1027
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,250
她26岁
She's 26 years old,

1028
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:46,175
但如果我有一次机会能和你在一起
but I would drop her in a heartbeat if it meant

1029
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,814
我立马就会甩了她
that I had one last chance with you.

1030
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,185
史蒂文 我和加里・金之间没有什么事
Steven, there's nothing between me and Gary King.

1031
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:54,918
他妈的
Oh, fuck.

1032
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:14,973
不好意思
Sorry.

1033
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,551
嘿! 把你的脚从她身上拿开!
Hey! Get your feet off her!

1034
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,766
把头拧掉! 就像拧开阿司匹林药瓶一样把她的头拧掉
Pop its head off! Pop its head off like an aspirin bottle.

1035
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,865
蓝血人?
Blue-bloods?

1036
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,231
过去3分钟我们的提议都不如
Nothing suggested in the last three minutes

1037
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,000
碎碎蛋头博士来得好
has been better than Smashy-Smashy Egg Men.

1038
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,668
- 都比不上  - 他妈的到底怎么回事?
- No. Nothing.  - What the hell's going on?

1039
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:48,004
你们想好怎么叫那些自称不是机器人的机器人了吗?
Did you guys think of a name for the robots who aren't robots?

1040
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,439
我想我们就叫空壳人了
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

1041
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,242
那我们刚刚就在花园里和两个空白人大干了一场
Well, we just had a barney with two blanks in the beer garden.

1042
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,916
- 我们现在就走吧!  - 同意
- We have to leave now!  - Agreed.

1043
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,349
我们出发去美人鱼
Let's hit The Mermaid.

1044
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,118
- 等等 什么?  - 第八家啊
- Wait, what?  - Number eight.

1045
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,152
"第八家"?
"Number eight"?

1046
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,429
- 他妈的  - 安迪 怎么回事?
- Oh, fuck.  - Andy, what's happening?

1047
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,234
加里认为我们应该继续按计划行动 因为他们知道我们要做什么
Gary thinks we should keep on with the crawl because they know what we're doing

1048
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,494
但他们不知道我们知道他们要做什么
but they don't know that we know what they're doing.

1049
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:14,772
而且主要别人也没更好的主意 所以他妈的就这样了
And basically no one else has a better idea, so fuck it.

1050
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,604
什么?
What?

1051
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,747
等等!
Wait!

1052
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,509
伙计们! 伙计们! 我有一个更好的主意
Guys! Guys! I've got a better idea.

1053
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,544
我的车就停在附近
I'm parked right round here somewhere.

1054
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,147
把车开过来 我们就马上走! 史蒂文 告诉他们!
Haul it. Just go! Steven, tell them!

1055
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,416
加里说如果我们现在打算离开 他们就会抓到我们
Gary said they'll get us if we try and leave now.

1056
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,057
现在说离开已经太晚了 来吧
We're way past leaving now. Come on.

1057
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,222
美人鱼

1058
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,269
没错 就该这样
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,970
孩子们就想要这样的
This is what the kids want.

1060
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,404
有点疯狂 不是吗?
This is a bit mad, isn't it?

1061
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,249
这才是完美 我们可以躲在这里 我去拿点酒
This is perfect. We can hide out in here. I'll get the drinks in.

1062
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,875
- 好计划 圈仔  - 嘿!
- Good plan, O-Man.  - Hey!

1063
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,446
小心空壳人
Keep an eye out for blanks.

1064
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:02,713
你终于领会了
You've got it.

1065
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:17,126
- 你之前为什么不说?  - 说什么?
- Why didn't you say anything?  - About what?

1066
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,970
你在花园里说的那些
About what you said in the garden.

1067
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,630
我一直想说
I always wanted to.

1068
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,632
但总觉得没有合适的时机
It just never seemed like the right moment.

1069
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,601
总有别的事要做
Something always got in the way.

1070
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,639
给 喝了这些吧
Here you go, get these down you.

1071
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,239
谢了
Thanks.

1072
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:31,613
史蒂文?
Steven?

1073
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,448
求求你! 我还有好多事没做呢!
Please! I have so much to live for!

1074
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,517
- 是我 你个笨蛋  - 巴希尔!
- It's me, you numpty.  - Basil!

1075
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,453
我就知道 看到你们的脸就意味着麻烦来了
I knew seeing your faces again would spell trouble.

1076
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,832
等等 我怎么知道你是不是真正的你?
Wait. How do I know it's really you?

1077
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,769
因为我是唯一要告诉你牛顿海文真相的人
Because I'm the only one who's going to tell you the truth about Newton Haven.

1078
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:56,866
现在 你还记得1990年6月22号傍晚发生的事吗?
Now, do you recall the events of the evening of June the 22nd, 1990?

1079
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,869
不记得了 但我认识一个人 他记得
No, but I know a man who does.

1080
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,040
- 给  - 嘿
- Here you go.  - Hey.

1081
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,021
有我们认识的人吗?
See anyone we know?

1082
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,886
- 甜心三明治  - 甜心三明治
- The Marmalade Sandwich.  - The Marmalade Sandwich.

1083
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:21,596
她们还像过去一样美
They look good.

1084
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,705
- 是灯光的效果  - 是酒的效果
- It's the lights.  - It's the drink.

1085
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,270
谁管它是什么的效果?
Who cares what it is?

1086
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,243
史蒂文?
Steven?

1087
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,641
史蒂文?
Steven?

1088
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,309
他们就是那晚来的
That was the night they arrived.

1089
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,545
记得那颗流星吗? 那就是他们
Remember the shooting star? That was them.

1090
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:43,889
一开始什么事都没有
Nothing happened at first.

1091
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:47,750
他们在准备 躲在地下 准备着
They were getting ready, burrowing in underground, preparing.

1092
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,886
不久以后 人们就开始转变了
Not long after you lot left, people started to change.

1093
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,798
一开始只有一两个 之后越来越多
Just one or two at first, then more.

1094
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,336
他们替换了有影响力的大人物 占领了大学
They replaced people of influence, taking over the institutions,

1095
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,802
重建 重塑 重组
remaking, remodeling, refurbishing.

1096
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,850
他们尽一切可能 让我们成为他们
Doing everything they could to make us join them.

1097
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:13,477
我找不到史蒂文了 其他人在哪里?
I can't find Steven. Where are the others?

1098
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:15,517
他们在调情
They're blending in.

1099
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,059
神经病
Oh, crumbs.

1100
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,352
替代品不是恶魔 完全不是
It's not like the replacements were evil, far from it.

1101
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:26,994
人们变得更友好 这就是他们做的
People got a lot friendlier. That's how they do it,

1102
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,559
这不是占领 是融合
It's not an invasion, it's a merger.

1103
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,541
他们不想除掉我们 根本不想
They don't want to get rid of us, not if they can help it.

1104
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:36,632
他们只是想让我们变得更像他们
They just want to make us more like them.

1105
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,534
改变我们思考的方式
Change the way we think.

1106
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,703
把我们和其他人都带到一条生产线上
Bring us into line with all the others.

1107
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:42,706
成为他们链条的一环
Become another link in their chain.

1108
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,551
这一切都很好 除非你拒绝
Which is fine, unless you say no.

1109
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,410
然后你就会被替换掉
That's when you get replaced.

1110
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,713
一旦他们拿到你的基因 你就完了
Once they get your DNA, they've got you.

1111
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:51,881
他们怎么拿?
How do they do that?

1112
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,215
用他们想用的任何方式
Any way they like.

1113
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:59,064
血液检测 打针护士 汗液 亲吻 杯缘的唾液
Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat, kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass.

1114
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,358
不然我为什么要用这么奇怪的吸管喝酒?
Why do you think I drink with this crazy straw?

1115
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:03,736
现在看上去不那么奇怪了吧?
Not so crazy now, is it?

1116
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,975
如果你反对他们 他们就会创造一个同意他们的你
If you're not on their side, they'll create a version that is.

1117
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,277
他们可以复制一模一样的你 甚至创造更年轻的你
They can bring you back exactly the same or even make you young again.

1118
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,702
那看上去很像你 甚至还有你的记忆
It looks like you, it even has your memories,

1119
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,238
但事实上那只是传播他们信息的管道
but really it's just a vessel to spread their message.

1120
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,609
信任 爱 尊敬 欲望
Trust, love, respect, desire.

1121
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,352
都以进化的名义被取代了
Replaced in the name of progress.

1122
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,992
那么 那些被替代的人怎么样了?
So, what happens to the people who get replaced?

1123
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,186
废容器? 别问我他们怎么样了
The empties? Don't ask me what happens to them.

1124
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,554
为什么 废容器怎么样了?
Why, what happens to the empties?

1125
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,255
我告诉过你不要问我!
I told you not to ask me that!

1126
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,532
快走! 快离开这里 否则就太晚了!
Go! Get out, before it's too late!

1127
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,631
- 巴希尔?  - 我说过快走!
- Basil?  - I said go!

1128
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,114
这太不好了
This just can't be good.

1129
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,350
山姆 你高二高三的时候喜欢的男孩子是谁? 阿德里安?
Sam, who was the boy that you liked in sixth form? Adrian?

1130
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,654
阿德里安・基恩 怎么了?
Adrian Keane. Why?

1131
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,483
他在那里
He's over there.

1132
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:07,161
嘿 山姆 过得怎么样?
Hey, Sam. How's life?

1133
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,629
- 山姆 我们得离开这里!  - 我们得离开这里!
- Sam, we have to get out of here!  - We have to get out of here!

1134
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,803
- 其他人在哪里?  - 他们在调情
- Where are the others?  - They're blending in.

1135
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,239
他妈的!
Oh, fuck!

1136
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,481
- 加里!  - 不要 再来一首歌
- Gary!  - Oh. No, just one more song.

1137
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,874
加里 她是空白人!
Gary, she's a blank!

1138
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,309
别这么歧视
Don't be so judgmental.

1139
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,311
他妈的...
Oh, for fuck...

1140
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,200
学校联谊会

1141
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,681
好吧 走吧
Oh, yeah. Come on.

1142
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,292
还是到手了 够了就是够了
Still got it. Enough's enough.

1143
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,683
我们快走
Let's go.

1144
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,960
哇 哇 哇 等等 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Hold up.

1145
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,391
你们要去哪?
Where are you all going?

1146
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,589
- 我们要走了  - 真的? 怎么回事?
- We're leaving.  - Really? What happened?

1147
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,524
- 阿德里安・基恩在酒吧里  - 蠢货
- Adrian Keane was in that bar.  - Prick.

1148
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,026
我还以为你喜欢阿德里安・基恩
I thought you liked Adrian Keane.

1149
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,728
- 阿德里安・基恩已经死了  - 天啊
- Adrian Keane is dead.  - Oh, God.

1150
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,797
八年前在意大利 阿德里安・基恩死于一场摩托车事故
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike accident in Italy eight years ago.

1151
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,666
- 是吗?  - 他们肯定拿到了他的基因
- Did he?  - They must have had his DNA on file.

1152
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,010
然后才能复制一个他
That's how they were able to replicate him.

1153
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:54,322
他们知道怎么抓到我们 老兄 他们知道一切
They know how to get to us, man. They know everything.

1154
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:57,039
- 他们不知道阿德里安死了  - 他们知道的足够诱惑我们了
- They didn't know Adrian was dead.  - They knew enough to tempt us.

1155
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,575
他们知道这三个家伙看到穿着校服的姑娘就无法自拔
They knew these three would fall for a bunch of girls in school uniform.

1156
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:03,078
- 嘿 谁不会呢? 我说的对吧?  - 他妈的还真对
- Hey, who wouldn't? Am I right?  - Fuck, yeah.

1157
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,213
我们得离开这个镇子
We've gotta get out of town,

1158
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:05,625
我们得在事情恶化之前离开这里
we've gotta get beyond it before it's too late.

1159
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,650
- 谁告诉你这些的?  - 巴希尔
- Where are you getting all this from?  - Basil.

1160
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:10,953
疯子巴希尔? 说百慕大四角洲和水下纳粹的?
Mad Basil? He of the Bermuda Rhombus and the Aqua Nazis?

1161
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,188
又一个很好的乐队名字 史蒂文
Another good name for the band, Steve.

1162
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,024
你就把我们的生命赌在那个疯老头身上?
You're putting our lives in the hands of a crazy old man?

1163
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,595
- 他没有疯!  - 或许他没疯
- He's not crazy!  - No, maybe he's not.

1164
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,694
或许他就是个空壳人 想引诱我们走到镇子边缘的
Or maybe he's a blank trying to lure us to the edge of town,

1165
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,196
黑色乡间小路上 然后他们就会把我们干掉
onto those dark country roads where they can deal with us.

1166
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:24,566
- 没错 我们可能最后会死在稻田里  - 我讨厌稻田
- Yeah, we could end up dead in a field.  - I hate fields.

1167
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,843
没错 我也是这么想的
Yes. My thoughts precisely.

1168
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,405
史蒂文说的对 我们应该离开
Steven's right. We should go.

1169
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,806
不 我们要去蜂巢
No, we're going to The Beehive.

1170
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,309
加里的计划仍然是现在的最佳计划
Gary's plan is still the best we have.

1171
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,187
等一下
Wait a minute

1172
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,718
九零款奥利弗在今晚此时退役
The 1990-model Oliver was out of commission by this point in the evening.

1173
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,152
你在说什么?
What are you saying?

1174
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,288
- 我喜欢新的你  - 哈
- I like the new you.  - Huh.

1175
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,267
走吧
Come on.

1176
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,426
这样做是不对的
This is a mistake, isn't it?

1177
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,748
快点! 跟我走
Hold up! Just stick with me.

1178
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,533
安迪 来啊!
Andy, come on!

1179
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:58,233
到啦 第九个酒吧
Here we go. Pub number nine.

1180
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,268
太他妈对了!
Fuck yes!

1181
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:01,749
这就是目标 目标! 皮特! 追求目标吧
That's the spirit, Pete! Spirits! We should do chasers.

1182
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,238
你真令人刮目相看
Who is this guy?

1183
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,686
来吧 安迪! 少了你就没法开始了
Come on. Andy! It can't start without you.

1184
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,347
你说什么?
You what?

1185
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,918
我们没你可不行
We can't start without you.

1186
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,832
好 现在轮到谁了?
Now then. Whose round is it?

1187
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,431
我来
It's mine.

1188
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,902
谢菲尔德先生! 是谢菲尔德老师?
Mr. Shepherd! Is it Mr. Shepherd?

1189
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:29,268
你们几个小鬼来一起坐吧? 一起喝一杯
Why don't you kids join me? You look like you could do with a drink.

1190
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,806
来谈谈你们的未来 怎么样?
Now, let's have a little chat about your future, shall we, hmm?

1191
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,282
- 谢菲尔德老师?  - 请叫我哥们
- Uh, Mr. Shepherd?  - Please, call me Guy.

1192
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,588
好吧
All right.

1193
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,280
哥们...
Guy...

1194
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,692
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

1195
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,422
你是机器人吗?
Are you a robot?

1196
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,601
谁知道机器人语出何处?
Does anyone know what robot means?

1197
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:54,929
- 我知道!  - 请说 加里
- Yeah. I do!  - Yes, Gary.

1198
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,925
意思就是"奴隶"
It means "slave."

1199
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,906
很好 加里
Oh, very good, Gary.

1200
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,929
那你是机器人吗?
Are you a robot, sir?

1201
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,843
不 皮特 我当然不是
No, Peter, of course I'm not a robot.

1202
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:04,945
- 先生?  - 请说 史蒂文
- Sir?  - Yes, Steven.

1203
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,468
但你站在他们那边的 对吗?
But you're on their side, though?

1204
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,211
无关站在哪边 史蒂文
This is not about sides, Steven.

1205
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,511
这与外在无关
It's not about shirts versus skins.

1206
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,282
这关乎精诚合作
It's about working together as one team.

1207
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,983
我知道有点奇怪 还有点吓人
I know it may seem a bit weird and a little bit scary,

1208
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,788
当请相信我 完全不是这样的
but please believe me, it's quite the opposite,

1209
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,552
他们是来帮助我们的
They're here to help.

1210
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:27,000
纠正我们 让我们准备好加入大家庭
To straighten us out. To prepare us for the big league.

1211
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:30,668
他们能看到我们的潜力
They've seen something in us, a potential.

1212
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:33,331
在那上面还有个庞大的社会
There's a vast community of worlds up there,

1213
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:37,706
一起生活 和平 合作
living together, peacefully, cooperatively.

1214
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:41,205
知道吗? 他们想让我们加入
And guess what? They want us along for the ride.

1215
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:45,245
很不错吧 兄弟们?
Pretty cool, eh, gang?

1216
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,946
那么 他们不会伤害我们?
So, they're not here to harm us?

1217
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:52,514
怎么会呢 圈仔 他们是来提供帮助的
Far from it, O-Man. No, they're here to help.

1218
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,384
我可没说他们惧怕暴力
I'm not saying they're afraid to get tough.

1219
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:58,127
过去我可被你们折腾的够呛
I certainly had to get tough with you in my day.

1220
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,661
难道你们中没有一个人对我表示感谢吗?
And what one amongst you wouldn't thank me for it? Hmm?

1221
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:05,227
请表示尊敬 他们其实更像教师
In some respects, they're a lot like teachers.

1222
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:09,598
严格 没错 有些可怕
Stern, yes. A little frightening.

1223
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,101
但都是为了我们好
But it's all for our betterment.

1224
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:17,986
我们要不要一起换个地方体面地谈谈这事儿?
So, what do you say we all go somewhere and talk about this properly?

1225
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,441
这么谈不体面吗?
That wasn't properly?

1226
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:23,083
嗯 我看很显然 谢菲尔德老师是想告诉我们...
Well, I think it's pretty clear, guys, what Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that...

1227
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,025
安迪! 你干什么?
Andy! What the fuck?

1228
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,730
是啊 安迪 你干什么?
Yes, Andy. What the fuck?

1229
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:39,396
人类 你们让我们别无选择
Humans, you leave us no recourse.

1230
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:42,610
如果你们不肯自愿加入我们
If you will not join us willingly,

1231
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:47,069
我们只能采取别的方式让你们就范
we will be forced to use other means of persuasion.

1232
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,708
现在 请...
Now, please...

1233
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,956
我他妈恨死这里啦!
I fucking hate this town!

1234
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:39,794
哦 哦!
Oh, oh!

1235
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,240
- 哦 哥们 你真重  - 不好意思
- Oh, crumbs, you're heavy.  - Sorry.

1236
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,164
该死的!
Motherfucker!

1237
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:36,584
安迪!
Andy!

1238
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,156
强扭瓜 哥们!
Twist the melon, man!

1239
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,361
棒!
Yeah!

1240
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:48,197
山姆 你难道连家人都不信任了吗
Sam, this is no way for a family to behave.

1241
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,412
山姆 我对你很失望
Sam, I'm disappointed in you.

1242
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:07,844
圈仔!
O-Man!

1243
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,559
好了 安迪
Okay, Andy.

1244
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,234
扯碎它
Break it up.

1245
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,567
完全没必要这样
It doesn't have to be like this.

1246
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:35,808
其实可以很简单的 完全没有痛苦的
It could be so much simpler, so completely painless.

1247
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,840
你们只需要看着那光
If only you'd see the light.

1248
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,075
是的
Yes.

1249
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:43,683
完全无需挣扎
See, it's not about conflict,

1250
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,449
只是聚合而已
it's about togetherness.

1251
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,556
好吧 再来一波 怎么样?
Yes. Let's try this again, shall we?

1252
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,155
在来一轮吧?
How about another round?

1253
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:56,602
不了 这的酒已经喝了
Nah, we're done here.

1254
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:01,029
好吧 加里 那试试这个
Yes, Gary, that appears to be the case.

1255
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,441
烟屋!
The Smokehouse!

1256
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,138
- 什么?  - 快走!
- What?  - Just do it!

1257
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,112
快点!
Come on!

1258
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,037
这边!
This way!

1259
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:20,916
人类 这是最后通牒
Humans, this is your final warning.

1260
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:23,193
若仍不服从 会导致...
Failure to comply will result in your...

1261
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:28,424
人类 立即服从 否则将承担一切后果
Humans, obey now, or face the consequences.

1262
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:32,795
快走!
Let's go!

1263
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,042
该死
Shit.

1264
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,012
哦 看 那是我的车!
Oh, look, there's my car!

1265
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:49,084
顺着排水管下去
Let's climb down the drainpipe.

1266
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,816
我有更好的办法
I've got a better idea.

1267
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,763
还是爬水管吧
Climb down the drainpipe.

1268
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,790
好了 快走
Okay, just go.

1269
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:02,824
等等 他们呢?
Wait. What about the others?

1270
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,392
有我呢 交给我了
Leave 'em with me, okay? I got this.

1271
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,304
- 你行吗?  - 当然 我绝对靠得住
- Are you sure?  - Yeah, I always land on my feet.

1272
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,150
让我很难相信 加里
I don't know if that's true, Gary.

1273
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:09,665
快走
Just go.

1274
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,034
别忘了找到我哥哥
Will you find out what happened to my brother?

1275
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,705
当然 放心好了 我还会照顾好史蒂文的
Yeah, of course, of course, and I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?

1276
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:19,046
他是个好男人 比我强
He's a good guy. He's better than me.

1277
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:23,314
加里 你不是坏人 不过你不是当男朋友的料
Gary, you're not a bad person, but you're not boyfriend material.

1278
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,082
"在残障厕所里快速来一发自由精神"这种事情
The whole "free spirit quick one in the disabled toilets" thing

1279
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,860
十七岁玩还可以 但是你现在已经奔四了
is kinda cool when you're 17, but not when you're facing 40.

1280
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,335
你得成熟起来 不能再幼稚了
There comes a time when you have to go forwards and not backwards.

1281
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,359
如果我那晚没有甩了你 现在事情就大不一样了
Maybe if I hadn't left you behind that night, things would all be different.

1282
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:41,800
不仅仅是那晚的事 加里
It's not all about that night, Gary.

1283
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:43,766
是吗?
Isn't it?

1284
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,674
根本就不该开始
It doesn't have to be.

1285
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,964
事情总是不能令人满意 是吧?
We'll always have the disableds, though, won't we?

1286
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,444
没错 总是不能令人满意
Yeah. Yeah, we'll always have the disableds.

1287
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:16,599
哦 不
Oh, no.

1288
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,256
山姆呢?
Where's Sam?

1289
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,719
我把她送到车上了
I put her in her car.

1290
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:32,916
你怎么她了?
You did what?

1291
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,995
我把她送到她的车上了 我告诉她让她走
I put her in her car. I just told her to leave.

1292
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,919
你把唯一清醒能开车的人送走了?
You just sent away the only one of us sober enough to drive?

1293
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,255
- 对  - 你是没法接受
- Yeah.  - You just couldn't stand the fact

1294
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:41,723
她更喜欢我这个事实
that she might prefer me to you.

1295
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,397
- 瞎扯  - 本来就是 加里!
- That's not true.  - It is true, Gary!

1296
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,433
我和她关系不一般 手拉手来着
I was getting somewhere. We held hands.

1297
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,263
- 我是想帮忙!  - 你在帮自己!
- I was just trying to help!  - You were trying to help yourself, more like!

1298
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:51,233
上帝啊 我将功补过来着 你们还没完了
Jesus, I do something right for a change and you fuckers get on my case.

1299
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:54,545
哇 头次听到你承认错误
Wow, that's the first time I've ever heard you admit being wrong.

1300
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,404
我说的是将功 功!
I said I did something right!

1301
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,672
对啊 "补过"不是吗
Yeah, "for a change".

1302
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,875
所以 这说明你肯定做错了什么
So? Meaning the rest of the time you're wrong.

1303
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,543
不可能
Not necessarily.

1304
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,880
听着 我是想让她离开这危险的地方
Look, I just thought it was best to keep her out of harm's way.

1305
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,249
那我们呢? 我们就呆在这危险的地方?
And what about us, Gary? Aren't we in harm's way?

1306
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,951
我们没事的 皮特 开玩笑 我们可是五个火枪手
We're all right, Pete. Come on, we're The Five Musketeers.

1307
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,023
不 现在是四个火枪手了
No, we're the Four Musketeers.

1308
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:17,637
等下 我们怎么知道你让她上车了?
Wait, how do we know you put her in the car?

1309
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,961
我们怎么知道你是你?
How do we know you're you?

1310
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,162
我当然是我!
Of course I'm me!

1311
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:24,474
- 你到底是谁 加里?  - 我是加里・金
- Well, who the fuck are you, Gary?  - I'm Gary King.

1312
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:27,602
只有一个加里・金 我怎么知道你们是谁?
There's only one Gary King. How do I know you guys are you?

1313
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,014
我们一直在一起
We've been together the whole time.

1314
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,507
也许你们全被换了呢 你怎么知道圈仔不再是圈仔了?
You might all not be you. How did you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?

1315
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,509
因为他的胎记回来了
Because his birthmark was back.

1316
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,845
- 那怎么了?  - 巴希尔说过
- What does that prove?  - Because of what Basil said.

1317
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,480
他们通过基因复制人
They make a copy from your DNA.

1318
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:39,848
所以他的胎记又出来了
That's why he had his birthmark.

1319
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,316
他是新的 就像刚生下一样
He was new, like a baby.

1320
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,285
成人版婴儿 或者婴儿版成人
Like a man-baby. Like a "maybe".

1321
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:45,527
假的奥利弗不会有真奥利弗身上那些后天的东西
Oliver with none of the shit that had happened to the real Oliver.

1322
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:47,722
激光除痕手术!
The laser surgery!

1323
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,168
所以空壳真的是只是空壳?
So the blanks really are just blank?

1324
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,539
没装饰 没眼泪 没伤疤
No wear and tear, no scars.

1325
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,430
史蒂文 1987年我们玩板球我推了你一把
Steven, in 1987 we were playing cricket and I accidentally pushed you

1326
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,632
你坐在玻璃瓶上了差点爆了菊花
onto a broken bottle that nearly went up your ass.

1327
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,907
- 干嘛?  - 让我们看你的屁股
- So?  - Show us your bum.

1328
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,374
- 很漂亮  - 谢谢
- Very nice.  - Thank you.

1329
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,044
皮特 1988你搞到了一辆铃木摩托
Pete, you got that 50cc Suzuki in 1988,

1330
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,206
我骑的时候轧过了你的腿
and you let me have a go on it and I ran over your leg.

1331
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,582
什么情况?
What the fuck?

1332
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,722
等等 是另一条腿
Oh, wait, it's the other one.

1333
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:22,429
安迪 1986年我们一起玩刀的时候
Andy, in 1986 we re-enacted the Knife Game from Aliens

1334
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:23,992
我把你的中指扎穿了
and I stabbed you in the middle finger.

1335
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:27,696
怎么不提1997年 你嗑药过量
How about December 1997, when you OD'd

1336
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:30,632
我开车送你去医院 四倍超速
and I drove you to the hospital four times over the limit

1337
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:34,636
车翻了 我差点弄断自己的股动脉
and I ended up rolling the car and almost severing my femoral artery,

1338
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:37,439
然后你奇迹般的恢复正常
at which point you made a miraculous fucking recovery

1339
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,709
直接午夜狂奔了 留下我一个人
and ran off into the night, leaving me to get arrested

1340
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,747
经过了十二小时抢救才活下来?
after 12 hours of life-saving surgery?

1341
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,552
你说这些没意义
Either one of those will do.

1342
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,151
- 谢谢  - 你呢?
- Thank you.  - What about you?

1343
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,594
很简单
That's easy.

1344
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:54,956
- 那很容易就画上去的  - 纹身不都是画上去的吗?
- That could have been drawn on.  - Aren't all tattoos drawn on?

1345
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,233
- 没错  - 让我们看胳膊
- Yeah.  - Show us your arm.

1346
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,603
- 啥?  - 把胳膊露出来
- What?  - Show us your arm.

1347
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:02,734
不 不
No, no.

1348
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:07,669
你在五年级舞会上从舞台上掉下来 胳膊肘脱臼了
You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball fucking around and dislocated your elbow.

1349
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,904
装入钢板的时候留下了疤
You've got a scar where they put the metal plate in.

1350
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,806
我没必要给你们看任何东西 好吧?
I don't have to show you anything, all right?

1351
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:14,175
我是加里・金 我知道自己是
I'm Gary King. I know I'm me.

1352
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,212
如果我不是我 我怎么知道你头上那梁上
If I'm not me, then how do I know that carved into that beam above your head

1353
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,247
刻着的字是"国王加里"?
are the words "King Gary"?

1354
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,448
那刻得根本不是什么"国王加里"
But it doesn't say "King Gary".

1355
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,929
怎么可能 绝对是!
Yes, it does. Doesn't it?

1356
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,920
不 那刻着是"国王基佬"
No. It says "King Gay".

1357
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,800
哪个混蛋把"R"给我划掉了!
Some cunt scrubbed out the "R"!

1358
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,392
- 是我  - 为什么?
- That was me.  - Why?

1359
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:33,028
"国王基佬" 意思是后宫三千尽菊花
"King Gay". That means fuck-all anyway.

1360
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,168
谢菲尔德老师都记得 还有奥利弗
Mr. Shepherd remembered stuff, so did Oliver.

1361
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:37,468
选择性记忆 明白吗?
Selective memory, remember?

1362
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:43,448
我们多少年没见你了 一见面你就把我们骗来这里
We don't see you for years and you just pitch up and bring us here.

1363
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:46,446
你还是想点有力的证据证明你是人类吧
You better come out with some hard evidence that you're human,

1364
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,352
否则我们就动手证明了
otherwise we're going to find out for ourselves.

1365
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,852
你想要证据?
You want evidence?

1366
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,488
瞧着!
There!

1367
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:01,291
这可以证明我是人类!
That proves I'm human!

1368
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,557
这可以证明你够蠢
It proves you're stupid.

1369
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,892
说得对!
Exactly!

1370
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,372
噢!
Ow!

1371
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,802
他是加里 是他
It's Gary. It's Gary.

1372
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,133
所有人都在找我们
The whole town's out looking for us.

1373
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,172
好事 所有人都在外面 那里面就没人了
That's a good thing. If everybody's outside, that means nobody's inside.

1374
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,642
加里 等等! 该死!
Gary, wait! Fuck!

1375
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,411
加里 加里! 什么叫"里面就没人了"
Gary, Gary! What do you mean "nobody's inside"?

1376
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,846
我是说我们可以继续!
I mean we can still do this!

1377
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:26,014
继续什么?
Do what exactly?

1378
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:27,615
继续行动啊
Oh, we're still on the crawl.

1379
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,759
"国王基佬"
"King Gay".

1380
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,227
皮特?
Peter?

1381
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,496
皮特
Peter.

1382
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:41,641
我就觉得是你 你没事吧?
I thought that was you. Are you okay?

1383
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,667
我怎么?
Am I what?

1384
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,868
我知道在学校我们互相看不顺眼
I know we didn't see eye to eye at school.

1385
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,076
上帝作证我是想表示歉意
Goodness knows I regret that.

1386
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:51,406
刚才在酒吧里我就想跟你说了
I wanted to say something back at the pub,

1387
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:54,354
但我对自己做的事情觉得很羞耻
but I felt so terribly ashamed by what I'd done.

1388
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,653
接受我的歉意吧 皮特 求你了
Let me make it up to you, Peter. Please.

1389
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,119
加里 你疯了吗? 我们跑太远了
Gary, you're out of your mind! We've come too far.

1390
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,186
这是要自杀
It's fucking suicide.

1391
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:09,023
我知道 哪怕死了 我们也要到世界尽头去
I know. We are going to get to The World's End if it kills us.

1392
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,825
皮特呢?
Where's Pete?

1393
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,567
我恨你!
I hate you!

1394
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,401
你这该死的的混蛋! 我恨你!
You fucking bastard! I hate you!

1395
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:18,833
皮特! 别这样! 你这是干嘛啊 皮特?
Pete! Leave it! Why are you doing this, Peter?

1396
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:19,972
我们不想伤害你
We don't want to hurt you.

1397
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,709
行了 哥们! 没必要这样!
Come on, mate! It's not worth it!

1398
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,048
有必要 绝对有必要!
Yes, it fucking is!

1399
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:27,587
他干什么?
What's he doing?

1400
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,415
该死
Oh, shit.

1401
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,313
皮特...
Peter...

1402
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,393
皮特...
Peter...

1403
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:39,729
我得说 我对你很失望 皮特
I must say, I'm very disappointed in you, Peter.

1404
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,028
我要把它们的灯都捶灭
I'll punch their fucking lights out.

1405
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,808
安迪! 不行 它们数量太多
Andy! No, no, no, there's too many of them.

1406
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:56,438
皮特
Pete.

1407
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,151
皮特
Peter.

1408
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,752
我们得走了 加里说的对
We gotta go. Gary's right.

1409
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:12,587
我们要去国王之颅
We gotta get to The King's Head. Exactly.

1410
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:13,726
啥?
What?

1411
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:17,759
我们不去国王之颅 那事儿完了
We are not going to The King's Head. We're done.

1412
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,727
我们要做早都该做的事情
We're going to do what we should have done in the first place.

1413
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,049
去开上野兽 立即离开这里
Get The Beast and get out of here.

1414
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,277
立即他妈的离开 绝不再来
We are fucking leaving and we are never coming back.

1415
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,235
你可以自愿跟我们走
Now, you can either come with us willingly

1416
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:30,238
或者我把你干到然后扛着你走
or I'm gonna knock you the fuck out and carry you there myself.

1417
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,307
- 你选吧  - 好了好了
- You choose.  - All right. All right.

1418
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:36,044
你知道自己在说什么吗 你喝多了
Just think about what you're saying, you know, because you have been drinking.

1419
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,046
你混蛋
You fuck.

1420
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,471
该死 是那群小孩
Shit, it's those fucking kids.

1421
01:18:56,632 --> 01:18:58,134
可别再来了
Not them again.

1422
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,006
那到底是什么?
What the hell is that?

1423
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,487
不知道 反正绝不是什么现代艺术
I don't know, but it's definitely not modern art.

1424
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,388
该死 被围住了 野兽在哪?
Oh, shit, we're trapped. Where's The Beast?

1425
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:24,826
好 我们在这里 野兽停在下一条街
Okay, all right. We're here, so The Beast is in the next street.

1426
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:25,994
怎么过去?
How are we gonna get to it?

1427
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:27,996
- 穿过这家店  - 哪家店?
- We'll have to go through.  - Through where?

1428
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,874
真他妈难以置信
I don't fucking believe this.

1429
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:32,875
第十个
Number 10.

1430
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:37,673
快点
Come on.

1431
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:41,954
快走
Let's go.

1432
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,422
后门 后门 快走
The backdoor, back door. Let's go.

1433
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,348
就这里
Here we go.

1434
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,519
就是这
Okay, there it is.

1435
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,321
该死
Shit.

1436
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,724
等空壳们没过来的时候 跑过去
We wait for an opening, and then we leg it to The Beast.

1437
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,329
车钥匙呢
We need the keys.

1438
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,035
加里?
Gary?

1439
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,573
加里 你干什么呢?
Gary, what are you doing?

1440
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,370
喝一点而已
Just a little toast.

1441
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,373
加里 把酒杯放下 好吗?
Gary, put the pint down, yeah?

1442
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:15,412
敬奥利弗 皮特
To Oliver, Pete.

1443
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:17,590
还有我们
And to us.

1444
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,384
知道吗 十个酒吧已经不错了
You know, 'cause 10 pubs isn't bad,

1445
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:24,563
是不错 没时间了
It's not, but we're calling time.

1446
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,556
好吧
Okay.

1447
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,914
就差一点了
So close.

1448
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:48,945
第十个
Number 10.

1449
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:51,914
好吧
Okay.

1450
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:53,888
就差一点了
So close.

1451
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,497
不 不 不 不 加里!
No, no, no, no, no. Gary!

1452
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,593
加里! 加里!
Gary! Gary!

1453
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:08,006
让他去吧 他以前也这么干过 哥们
Let him go. He left you, man.

1454
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,766
我不能
I can't.

1455
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,600
安迪!
Andy!

1456
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,650
加里! 加里!
Gary! Gary!

1457
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,625
加里 快回来! 回来你个蠢货!
Gary, come back! Come back, you stupid bastard!

1458
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:55,916
加里!
Gary!

1459
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,955
加里! 加里!
Gary! Gary!

1460
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,372
安迪 小心!
Andy, look out!

1461
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,234
拜托!
Come on!

1462
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:45,194
你他妈...
What the...

1463
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,473
进来 进来
Get in. Get in.

1464
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,711
加里 安迪 快点进来!
Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!

1465
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,811
你听到了 安迪 快进去
You heard him, Andy. Get the fuck in.

1466
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,814
没时间啦!
We haven't much time!

1467
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:12,823
- 安迪! 快跑!  - 史蒂文!
- Andy! Go, now!  - Steven!

1468
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:15,027
快跑!
Go!

1469
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:35,988
安迪
Andy.

1470
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,450
来插我吧
I want you inside me.

1471
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:41,550
好吧
Okay.

1472
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:47,990
哟呵
Cheers.

1473
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,718
啊!
Ah!

1474
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,691
- 你够了!  - 这里是世界尽头!
- You've had enough!  - This is The World's End, man!

1475
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:13,918
我知道!
I know!

1476
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:15,684
别这样!
Stop this!

1477
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,054
别管我! 干嘛管我啊?
Leave me alone! What do you care anyway?

1478
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,691
我当然要管你 我对你很生气!
Of course I fucking care. There's a reason I'm angry at you!

1479
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:25,726
我知道你为什么生我气
I know why you're angry at me, okay?

1480
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:28,230
但你把车开翻了管我什么事
But it's not my fault that you crashed that car.

1481
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,311
不是说这个 你让我失望了 哥们
That's not the point. You let me down, man.

1482
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,477
你是加里・金 该死的加里・金
You were Gary King. Gary fucking King.

1483
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:39,173
我应该跟你走向世界尽头 我做到了!
I would have followed you to the end. I fucking have!

1484
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,347
那就别跟着我了!
Then stop following me!

1485
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:49,091
不! 再来一杯
No! It's just one more.

1486
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,594
让我喝了这杯
Let me have this.

1487
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,655
你们想要的都得到了
You've got everything you want.

1488
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,090
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

1489
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,994
你们有好工作 好房子 好老婆
You've got your perfect job and your perfect house and your perfect wife.

1490
01:24:59,995 --> 01:25:01,406
你觉得这些很好吗?
You think it's so perfect?

1491
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,542
她走了 加里
She left me, Gary.

1492
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,402
她三周前带着孩子回娘家了
She took the kids to her mum's three weeks ago,

1493
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:11,839
说我不够好 我努力地想把她追回来
Said I'm not present enough. I'm trying to win her back.

1494
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,474
我才是个失败者
And God knows I am losing.

1495
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:17,514
但我还不放弃 这就是我们的生存方式
But I will continue to fight, because that is how we survive.

1496
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:22,783
该死的 加里 我刚刚把我的结婚戒指从一个机器人的胃里掏出来了
For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.

1497
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,986
说得对! 你为了重要的东西而奋斗
Exactly! You fight for what's important.

1498
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:27,054
豪饮马拉松对你来说这么重要吗?
But what is so important about The Golden Mile?

1499
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,557
我只有这个追求了!
It's all I've got!

1500
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,428
加里
Gary.

1501
01:25:49,463 --> 01:25:51,712
查特汉姆皇家医院 精神科

1502
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,085
你需要帮助 加里
You need help, Gary.

1503
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,795
我得到帮助了 你知道是什么样的帮助吗?
I got help. You know what help was?

1504
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,987
帮助就是一群人坐成一个圈
Help was a lot of people sitting in a circle

1505
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,934
互相说着那些自己身上发生的可怕的事
talking about how fucking awful things had got.

1506
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,925
那不是我想要的好日子
That is not my idea of a good time.

1507
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,998
- 那这就是了?  - 他们告诉我该上床睡觉了
- And this is?  - They told me when to go to bed.

1508
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:10,232
我!
Me!

1509
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:16,504
加里 兄弟 从没清醒过你怎么能知道自己醉了?
Gary, mate, how can you tell when you're drunk if you're never sober?

1510
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:18,416
我不想清醒
I don't wanna be sober.

1511
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,412
那一晚无与伦比
It never got better than that night.

1512
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,931
那本该是我开始新生活的一晚
That was supposed to be the beginning of my life.

1513
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,593
那样的承诺和乐观
All that promise and fucking optimism.

1514
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:32,364
感觉我们就像拥有整个宇宙
That feeling like we could take on the whole universe.

1515
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:34,591
全是谎话
It was a big lie.

1516
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:38,526
什么都没有发生
Nothing happened.

1517
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,200
你没必要这样 加里
You don't need to do this, Gary.

1518
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,604
有 有必要
Yeah, I do.

1519
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:50,640
请勿移动
Please, stand by.

1520
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,244
请勿移动
Please, stand by.

1521
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,283
请勿移动
Please, stand by.

1522
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:01,994
请勿移动
Please, stand by.

1523
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:05,631
啊!
Ah!

1524
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:50,364
你干什么?
What are you doing?

1525
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,038
别 别出去
No, don't go out there.

1526
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:54,841
加里・金
Gary King.

1527
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,211
是我
Yeah?

1528
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,885
人类成员加里・金
Gary King of the humans.

1529
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:05,054
是我 想干嘛?
Yeah. What do you want?

1530
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,949
我们是来激发你们全部潜能的
We are here to enable your full potential,

1531
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:12,386
就像在银河不可胜数的世界上做的一样
as we have with countless worlds across the galaxy.

1532
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,958
是吗? 说说怎么做的?
Oh, yeah? How'd you manage that, then?

1533
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,591
我们在星球上2000个左右的渗入区
We appropriate a small percentage of the population

1534
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,903
侵占一定比例的人口
at 2,000 or so penetration points across the planet.

1535
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:24,006
用以保证一定的覆盖率
This ensures maximum coverage.

1536
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:30,037
从那里 我们制造复制人通过和平教化
From there, we create simulants to spread our ideologies

1537
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,711
来传播我们的观念
through peaceful indoctrination.

1538
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:35,981
我们的目标很简单 让这里的居民做好准备
Our objective is simple, to ready the population

1539
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:38,717
加入我们的伟大社会
for participation in our galactic community.

1540
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:43,293
这种方法需要一定的牺牲
This method requires a small sacrifice.

1541
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:45,727
但是我们对行动的评估
But the fewer replacements we make,

1542
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:48,155
主要取决于替换人数的多少 越少越好
the more successful we consider our operation.

1543
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:52,730
当然 我们欢迎志愿者
Of course, we welcome those who volunteer themselves.

1544
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:57,773
对自愿合作的人 我们提供极好的奖励
We can offer attractive incentives for those who willingly combine.

1545
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:01,643
可以返老还童 并选择性地保留记忆
The chance to be young again and yet retain selected memories.

1546
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,148
这样你们不喜欢吗?
Isn't that something you'd like?

1547
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,419
你们一直想要的东西?
Something you've always wanted?

1548
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:21,162
天呐! 我真帅!
Oh, my God! I'm so cute!

1549
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:25,730
这种双赢正是我们系统的美好之处
The beauty of our system is that we all win.

1550
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,168
没有失败者
There are no losers.

1551
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:34,107
让我续写你的传奇
Allow me to carry your legend forward.

1552
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:38,713
让年轻的自己重走你的人生路
Let the man you have become be the boy you were.

1553
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:49,960
不要
Nah.

1554
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,998
只有一个加里・金
There's only one Gary King.

1555
01:29:54,990 --> 01:30:00,463
这就是你的选择了 人类成员加里・金
Then you have made your choice, Gary King of the humans.

1556
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,329
对 是我的选择
Yeah, I have.

1557
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:07,334
话说回来 你他妈是什么东西啊来这里指手画脚的?
Because frankly, who the fuck are you to come down here and tell us what to do?

1558
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,839
我们是网络 我们来为你们谋福利
We are The Network and we are here for your betterment.

1559
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,307
在过去的二十三年中
In the last 23 years,

1560
01:30:13,308 --> 01:30:16,289
你难道没察觉到信息技术的爆炸式发展吗?
have you not marveled as information technology has surged forward?

1561
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:17,845
没有
No.

1562
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:22,116
随着沟通的增强地球本身变得小而精彩
Earth has grown smaller yet greater as connectivity has grown.

1563
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:25,719
这是我们的杰作 这仅仅是个开始
This is our doing and it is just the beginning.

1564
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,223
哦 得了吧 大灯泡
Oh, fuck off, you big lamp.

1565
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,699
你们是孩子 你们需要教导
You are children and you require guidance.

1566
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:33,831
不能容忍瑕疵的存在
There is no room for imperfection.

1567
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:37,837
地球本不完美 好吗? 人类本不完美
Hey, Earth isn't perfect, all right? And humans aren't perfect.

1568
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:40,377
知道吗? 连我也不完美
And guess what? I ain't perfect.

1569
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,837
因此才需要我们的介入
And therein lies the necessity for this intervention.

1570
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:48,442
难道银河要受制于你们这种人所管理的地球吗?
Must the galaxy be subjected to an entire planet of people like you?

1571
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:51,686
哇 哇 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1572
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:54,114
凭什么你说了算 啊?
Who put you in charge, huh?

1573
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,425
你有什么资格评判别人?
Who are you to criticize anyone?

1574
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:58,892
你也许觉得加里是个混球
Now, you might think Gary's a bit of a cock,

1575
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,798
虽然他确实有点混 但我喜欢
and he is a bit of a cock, but he's my cock.

1576
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:04,358
谢谢 哥们
Oh, thanks, man.

1577
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:09,063
但他损害了自己的利益 地球也在损害着银河的利益
But he is a detriment to himself, just as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy.

1578
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:10,197
你说什么?
What did you say?

1579
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:14,169
你们无数次实行着毁灭自己的行为
You act out the same cycles of self-destruction again and again.

1580
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:19,241
如今整个银河中你们的星球是文明程度最低的星球
At this point your planet is the least civilized in the entire galaxy.

1581
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,250
- 他说什么?  - 他说我们是一群该死的蠢货
- What did he say?  - He's saying we're a bunch of fuck-ups.

1582
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,980
做蠢货是我们的基本人权
Hey, it's our basic human right to be fuck-ups.

1583
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:30,154
这个文明就是蠢货建立的 你知道吗?
This civilization was founded on fuck-ups. And you know what?

1584
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,753
- 我为此而骄傲  - 我也是!
- That makes me proud.  - And me!

1585
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:35,530
那句话怎么说来着? "人非圣贤"
What is it they say? "To err is..."

1586
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,157
"人非圣贤孰能无过"
"To err is human."

1587
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,696
"人非圣贤孰能无过"所以 嗯...
"To err is human," so, uh...

1588
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,631
我们认为你们不能代表全体人类
We do not believe you speak for all humanity.

1589
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,768
你们只有两个人 两个醉鬼
You are but two men. Two drunk men.

1590
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:49,442
三个醉鬼!
Three drunk men!

1591
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,506
史蒂文宝贝!
Stevie-baby!

1592
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:57,923
够了! 够了 人类!
Enough! Enough, humans!

1593
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:03,450
哦 你麻烦大了 三个火枪手到齐了
Oh, you are in trouble now. It's only the fucking Three Musketeers.

1594
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:07,388
你们这是要背叛无数星系的智慧生命
You are revolting against the wisdom of countless solar systems.

1595
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:08,834
没错 我们就是要背叛!
Yeah, we are revolting!

1596
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,630
你刚刚说你不是来征服的 让我问问你
You just said you're not here to conquer. Can I just ask,

1597
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:15,638
你在纽顿海文替换掉了多少人?
how many people did you have to replace in Newton Haven?

1598
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:17,470
- 与此无关  - 是吗?
- That is irrelevant.  - Is it?

1599
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:21,880
举手 这里谁是人类?
Hands up. Who here is human?

1600
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,907
- 我是  - 一个!
- I'm human.  - One!

1601
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:27,682
- 还有我  - 两个
- And me.  - That's two.

1602
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,277
我也是 但不知道还能做多久
I am. But don't know for how long.

1603
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:31,845
- 巴希尔!  - 嘘...
- Basil!  - Shh...

1604
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:35,649
怎么样? 三个人? 你把整个镇的人都替换了?
So what's that? Three? You had to replace an entire town?

1605
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,950
不是整个镇
Not the entire town.

1606
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:40,320
包括纳特博尔和谢夫迪双胞胎的所有人
Everybody apart from old Nutbowl and the Shifty twins.

1607
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,356
这名字用在乐队上不错啊 加里 你该记下来
That's a good name for a band, Gary. You should write that down.

1608
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:44,425
我会的 那你替换掉的那些人呢
I will. What about the ones you replaced,

1609
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:45,959
皮特和奥利弗他们?
like Peter and Oliver?

1610
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,328
这些废容器你们怎么处理了?
Yeah, what happened to the empties?

1611
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,240
告诉过你别问这个!
I told you not to ask that!

1612
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,902
废容器被回收利用转化为肥料
Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched and converted into fertilizer,

1613
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:57,471
他们被归还给土壤用于绿化
whereupon they are returned to the earth to promote verdancy and growth.

1614
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,207
这是非常高效的有机物回收利用手段
It is a highly efficient means of organic renewal.

1615
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,508
做肥料?
Mulched?

1616
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,911
根据我们的长远规划 这只是一小部分
It is a relative few in light of our long-term plan.

1617
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:07,247
你是说有那么几十万人被你们做成该死的农家肥了?
You mean a few hundred thousand turned to fucking compost?

1618
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,583
那其他那些地方的人呢? 其他那些渗入点?
What about the other places? The penetration points.

1619
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,686
都像纽顿海文这么成功吗?
Are they as successful as Newton Haven?

1620
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:15,689
因为我觉得 你系统里不听话的人不止我们几个吧
Because I'm guessing we're not the only glitch in your system.

1621
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:19,160
是的 网络的确面对过一些挫折
It is true, The Network has been experiencing some difficulties.

1622
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:22,763
我猜你们觉得地球没有那么容易被搞定 对吧?
I think you bit off more than you can chew with Earth, mate.

1623
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:25,040
没错 因为我们更好斗 更顽强
Yeah, 'cause we are more belligerent, more stubborn

1624
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:27,468
比你想象的更白痴吧
and more idiotic than you can possibly imagine,

1625
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:29,436
我不仅在说加里
and I am not just talking about Gary.

1626
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,105
是的 他这样的人还多得是
Yeah, there's more than one Gary King.

1627
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,053
- 但你们说过...  - 我知道我说过什么!
- But you said...  - I fucking know what I fucking said!

1628
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:38,345
你们对亵渎的依赖说明了你们作为人或者是物种都是不成熟的
Your reliance on profanity is a measure of your immaturity as a man and a species,

1629
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:42,590
你干嘛不滚回你的火箭飞回你们的天国去呢 蠢货!
Why don't you just get in your rocket and fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts!

1630
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:46,520
- 对! 别想在这里开连锁店!  - 就是!
- Yeah! Stop fucking Starbucking us, man!  - Yeah!

1631
01:33:46,521 --> 01:33:48,288
转化你们是我们的责任
It is our duty to challenge you.

1632
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,125
我们的事我们自己说了算 混账!
Just leave us to our own devices, you intergalactic arseholes.

1633
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:52,726
- 你们误会了  - 闭嘴!
- You misunderstand.  - Shut up!

1634
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,595
- 我们试图...  - 我不听我不听!
- We are trying...  - Nobody's listening!

1635
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:55,662
如果你们...
If you'd only...

1636
01:33:55,663 --> 01:34:00,874
面对吧 我们是人类 我们不需要别人教我们怎么做
Face it, we are the human race and we don't like being told what to do.

1637
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:05,309
你们想要的到底是什么?
Just what is it that you want to do?

1638
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,408
- 我们想要自由!  - 没错
- We want to be free!  - Yeah.

1639
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,511
我们想要为所欲为!
We want to be free to do what we want to do!

1640
01:34:10,512 --> 01:34:11,513
就是
Yeah.

1641
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,280
- 我们要喝醉  - 没错
- We want to get loaded.  - Yeah.

1642
01:34:13,281 --> 01:34:15,249
想玩个痛快
And we want to have a good time.

1643
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,526
我们就是这样
And that's what we're going to do.

1644
01:34:18,553 --> 01:34:21,088
简直是对牛弹琴
It is pointless arguing with you.

1645
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:24,127
你们自己做主吧
You will be left to your own devices.

1646
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,862
真的?
Really?

1647
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:27,064
是的
Yeah.

1648
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:28,763
操
Fuck it.

1649
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:41,079
他们熄火了
They fucked off.

1650
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:49,295
耶 耶 耶 顶你! 你! 还有你!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Up yours! Up yours! Up yours!

1651
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:53,387
耶 成功了 我们赢了!
Yeah, we did it! We won, we won!

1652
01:34:57,225 --> 01:34:59,136
加里 快闪吧
Gary, let's Boo-Boo.

1653
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,433
这里要毁了 是吧?
Yeah, it's shit here, isn't it?

1654
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:09,445
喂 从这走!
Oi, up here!

1655
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:10,872
走!
Go!

1656
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:15,076
上去
Get up.

1657
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:16,555
快点!
Come on!

1658
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,432
干得好
Well done.

1659
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:37,064
太谢谢你了 享受胜利的果实吧?
Thanks a bunch. Had to go and spoil it, didn't you?

1660
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,011
高兴了吧现在?
Yeah, happy now?

1661
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:41,404
巴希尔 现在做什么?
Basil, what do we do now?

1662
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:43,570
跟以前一样
Same as before.

1663
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,380
跑!
Go!

1664
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:50,849
野兽呢?
Where's The Beast?

1665
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,447
野兽牺牲了 哥们
The Beast is dead, mate.

1666
01:35:53,448 --> 01:35:56,783
知道吗... 知道什么事让我不爽吗?
You know what... You know what's really annoying?

1667
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:57,851
什么?
What?

1668
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:00,526
我发誓不要死在这里的
I promised myself I wouldn't die in this town.

1669
01:36:02,357 --> 01:36:03,995
你不会的
You're not gonna.

1670
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:07,160
我们已经转运了
I think our luck just changed.

1671
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:08,765
呜呼!
Whoo-hoo!

1672
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:11,509
噢!
Oh!

1673
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,000
不好意思!
Sorry!

1674
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:15,003
- 山姆?  - 是我
- Sam?  - Yes.

1675
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:16,436
你回来救我们了!
You came back for us!

1676
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:19,281
没错 其实我是在环路上迷路了 但我确实回来了
Yes, I did. Well, I got lost on the ring road. But, yes.

1677
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:23,243
嗨 山姆 捎我们去伦敦好吗?
Hi, Sam, could you give us a lift to London, please?

1678
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:25,112
我哥哥到底怎么样了?
Did you find out what happened to my brother?

1679
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,153
路上再跟你说
We'll tell you on the way.

1680
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:30,517
对不起有点乱 我本想回头弄干净的
Sorry about the mess. I've been meaning to clear that up.

1681
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:32,725
- 原谅你了 快走  - 朝哪?
- We forgive you. Let's go.  - Which way?

1682
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:34,589
朝后!
Backwards!

1683
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,453
现在朝哪?
Which way now?

1684
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,386
直走!
Go straight over!

1685
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:19,244
我们能做到
We can make it.

1686
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,739
我们就要做到了
We're gonna make it.

1687
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:31,754
我们成功了!
We made it!

1688
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:33,808
对不起
I'm sorry.

1689
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:38,718
我知道
I know.

1690
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:41,887
我知道
I know.

1691
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:43,850
当整个地球失去灯光的时候
Everyone remembers where they were

1692
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:46,024
每个人都记得当时自己在哪里
when the lights went out on Planet Earth.

1693
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:50,432
我 加里 史蒂文和山姆当时就站在开关旁边
Me, Gary, Steven and Sam, we were standing right by the switch.

1694
01:38:51,559 --> 01:38:54,403
我们一起度过了一个漫长的黑夜
I guess it was a big night for everyone.

1695
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:58,272
随之而来的清晨让"宿醉"这个词有了全新的定义
That morning gave a whole new meaning to the word "hangover".

1696
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:03,638
我们决定散步解酒 一路走回了伦敦
We decided to walk it off, all the way back to London,

1697
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:08,146
但是头痛丝毫没有缓解 反而一直持续不断
but the headache didn't end there. It just went on and on.

1698
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:11,515
说起伦敦
Talk about the Big Smoke.

1699
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:18,129
当网络瘫痪时 造成了某种停顿
When The Network went down, it triggered some kind of pulse,

1700
01:39:19,854 --> 01:39:21,765
使我们的技术化为乌有
wiped out all our technology

1701
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:25,362
导致我们现在
and sent us here,

1702
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,198
回到了黑暗中世纪
back to the Dark Ages.

1703
01:39:30,398 --> 01:39:33,572
伤亡在所难免 我就知道不少
There were casualties, of course. I knew a few of them.

1704
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:37,847
一个同事 我表弟保罗 加里的妈妈
Some guy from work, my cousin Paul, Gary's mum.

1705
01:39:40,842 --> 01:39:43,243
没人清楚我们到底死了多少人
Nobody really knew how many we lost,

1706
01:39:43,244 --> 01:39:45,912
因为地球上的通信联系再也没恢复过
because we never heard from the rest of the world again.

1707
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,654
只留下无数的孤岛
Everyone got cut off.

1708
01:39:48,616 --> 01:39:51,256
的确很艰难 但也很简单
It isn't easy now, but it is simpler.

1709
01:39:51,786 --> 01:39:54,254
我妻子回到了我的身边 这是件好事
I'm back with the wife, which is something.

1710
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:58,291
我们一致认为我俩之间的事情与周围比起来微不足道
We decided our problems didn't seem as bad in the grand scheme of things,

1711
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:02,229
我们只能吃天然食品 但说实话
We all had to go organic in a big way, but if I'm honest,

1712
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:05,837
我真的很怀念那些垃圾食品
I'm hard pressed to recall any processed foods I actually miss.

1713
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:13,149
而那些空壳 产生了一些有意思的变化
As for the blanks, well, a funny thing happened there.

1714
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:15,554
他们醒了
They woke up.

1715
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:20,086
网络离开后大约一周 他们好像是自我启动了
A week or so after The Network pulled out, they just sort of rebooted by themselves,

1716
01:40:21,082 --> 01:40:22,755
想要重新做人了
tried to start afresh.

1717
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:28,323
一开始他们很迷茫 就像离开了父母的小孩子
They seemed lost at first, children cut off from their parents,

1718
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:33,666
被抛弃 被遗忘 寻求指引 希望得到帮助
abandoned, forgotten, looking for guidance, for someone to show them the way.

1719
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:36,809
说实话 对它们我感到有点内疚
I felt a bit sorry for them, to be honest.

1720
01:40:38,566 --> 01:40:40,400
网络说对了一件事
The Network was right about one thing.

1721
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:42,779
我们真的是不怎么文明
We can be a bit uncivilized.

1722
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:47,112
也许已经对银河的其他世界造成了恶劣的影响
Maybe we would've been a bad influence on the rest of the galaxy.

1723
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,810
奥利弗重新做了房产销售
Oliver went back to being an estate agent.

1724
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,113
人们仍然需要房屋遮风避雨
People still need a roof over their heads,

1725
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:55,492
老奥利一向很能扯淡
and the old Ollie always had a gift for the gab.

1726
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:58,785
我估计他的替代品继承了这一点
I guess the new one has, too.

1727
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:00,493
他干得很不错
He's doing all right.

1728
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:04,026
我听说皮特回到了毕肖普花园的家
I hear that the Peter found his way home to Bishop's Gardens.

1729
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:08,170
估计是被别人遗弃后他又占了回来
I suppose he picked up where the other one left off.

1730
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:11,473
不知他老婆有没有注意到
I'm not sure his wife noticed.

1731
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:16,077
估计只是佯装不知吧 他是个好父亲
Maybe she chose not to. He's a pretty good dad by all accounts.

1732
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,074
史蒂文和山姆在一起了
Steven and Sam got together in the end.

1733
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,043
完全不在乎世界的现状
Didn't see that coming.

1734
01:41:23,044 --> 01:41:25,312
他们住在伦敦城外的棚屋里
They shacked up just outside London.

1735
01:41:25,313 --> 01:41:27,589
棚屋也相当不错
It's a pretty nice shack, too.

1736
01:41:28,049 --> 01:41:31,155
至于加里? 不知道加里怎么样了
As for Gary? I don't know what happened to Gary.

1737
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,301
自从分手后再没见过他
We got separated and I never saw him again.

1738
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:39,860
据说他回到了纽顿海文 不知道为什么
Some say he went back to Newton Haven. I don't know why.

1739
01:41:40,628 --> 01:41:42,630
我觉得他在那里也没事可做
I think his business there was done.

1740
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:46,675
很有意思 但我很想他
It's funny, but I miss him.

1741
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:51,514
不知他是不是想我 想我们
I wonder if he misses me. Misses the boys.

1742
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:00,692
不论在哪里 我希望他快乐
Wherever he is, I hope he's happy.

1743
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:03,083
那是他最看重的东西
That's all he ever wanted, really.

1744
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:04,722
玩个痛快
To have a good time.

1745
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:08,391
希望他可以在酒杯以外的地方找到快活
I just hope he found it beyond the bottom of a glass.

1746
01:42:09,557 --> 01:42:14,267
因为真的幸福 真的朋友 才是生活的意义
Because real happiness, real friends, those are things worth living for,

1747
01:42:15,997 --> 01:42:17,670
是值得为之奋斗的东西
worth fighting for.

1748
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:31,254
混蛋空壳
Blank bastards.

1749
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:36,388
该死的机器人
Fucking robots.

1750
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:47,063
五杯水 谢谢
Five waters, please.

1751
01:42:49,397 --> 01:42:50,899
你可以要一杯
You can have one.

1752
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:53,667
这些杂碎我不招待
But I ain't serving this scum.

1753
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:56,706
我觉得应该人人为我 我为人人
Well, I'm afraid it's all for one and one for all.

1754
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:59,272
你瞧 我和我的小伙伴一起冒险
You see, my young friends and I are on an adventure.

1755
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:02,942
完成某个任务 如果我们需要点刺激的话
A quest, if you will. And since we find ourselves in need of refreshment,

1756
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:05,651
你 先生 你将为此付出血的代价
you, sir, have the honor of drawing first blood.

1757
01:43:06,814 --> 01:43:08,885
所以 我再说一遍
So, I'll ask you again,

1758
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:10,762
最后一遍
for the last time,

1759
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:15,191
五杯水 谢谢
five waters, please.

1760
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:26,043
你他妈以为自己是谁?
Who the hell do you think you are?

1761
01:43:26,434 --> 01:43:30,280
我? 他们管我叫老金
Me? They call me The King.
