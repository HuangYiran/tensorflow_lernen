00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was playing solitaire.

8
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The computer cheats, you know.

14
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:51,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh I'm...

15
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:54,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not. It's for my mother.

16
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:57,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God. I'm back living with my mother, too.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was me.

24
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, when'd you graduate?

25
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't. I never completed my thesis.

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On what?

27
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Completion anxiety.

28
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought only guys got that.

29
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:30,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, is your mom home now or what?

31
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:37,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too bad.

32
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, see you around.

00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:47,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

34
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Was that guy hitting on me? - Baby, you're beautiful.

35
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. But I think that guy was hitting on me.

36
00:02:56,518 --> 00:03:00,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Maybe I should go ask him out. - Nica.

37
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was just being nice.

38
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:06,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

39
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I just don't ever want to see you get hurt.

40
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:19,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you swore off the Home Shopping Network.

41
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:22,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't bought anything in three weeks.

42
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:24,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you have a secret admirer.

43
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You sound threatened. - No. Not at all.

44
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

45
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's it from?

46
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't say.

47
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:00,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be some kind of joke.

48
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't get it. - Neither do I.

49
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's cute.

50
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:09,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you say so.

51
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:14,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

52
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice will love him.

53
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:26,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I DVR'd Real Housewives.

54
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to make tuna melts later. Okay?

55
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

56
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

57
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

58
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:21,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

59
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

60
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom! No.

61
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:05,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need an ambulance right away. It's my mother.

62
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:09,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I don't know. There's so much blood.

63
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:27,313


64
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica.

00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

66
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was fine.

67
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was taking her meds, she was painting again.

68
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. No. - She was fine.

69
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could she do that, Barbie?

70
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could she do that to herself?

71
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember Father Frank.

72
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Hello, Father.

73
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so very sorry for your loss, Nica.

74
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

75
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:21,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your sister just thought it might be a good idea for me to come.

76
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:22,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I appreciate it.

77
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know my mother and I both left the church a long time ago.

78
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not in the eyes of God.

79
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:34,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought it might be nice for us to have someone to talk to.

80
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have each other.

81
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica.

82
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to pray for her. To be forgiven.

83
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:50,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was sick. You can't judge her.

84
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one is judging her.

85
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:56,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, the church's official response to a situation like this

86
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is not to judge, but to pity.

87
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:03,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother and I have had quite enough pity, thank you.

88
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:06,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand.

89
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my fault.

90
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should have seen it coming.

91
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:17,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica, you cannot blame yourself.

92
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was supposed to be taking care of you.

93
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey. - Hey, Ian.

94
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gimme a hug.

95
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that a new chair? - Yeah.

96
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's cool. - Thank you.

97
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Jill, my new au pair.

98
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, I'm just the nanny. - Hi.

99
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry, Nica.

100
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. I'm glad you're here.

101
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:03,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here, you.

102
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:10,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm so happy to see you. - Me, too.

103
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:15,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Grandma go to heaven?

104
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sweetie, she did.

105
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:27,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I have a surprise for you.

106
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny.

107
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:43,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy, I have to go to the bathroom.

108
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:45,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Jill will take you.

109
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:49,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You show her the way. Mommy needs to talk to Aunty Nica.

110
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:51,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jill, let's go.

111
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:01,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm going to go with them. Okay?

112
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, you don't have to lock the door.

113
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But somebody might come in. - We won't let anybody in.

114
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about you guys?

115
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, we really don't want to see you do your business.

116
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:17,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, bye.

117
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So listen, how much is she paying you again?

118
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$400 a week.

119
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's more than I make.

120
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe you should consider a career change.

121
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:33,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I'd be a great nanny. $400 a week!

122
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:35,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Man. - Yeah, but no benefits.

123
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:08,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name?

124
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice? Alice, open the door, honey!

125
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice? Alice, open the door right now.

126
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He scared me half to death.

127
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,751


128
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:35,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

129
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:42,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Mom left the house to both of us.

130
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:44,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So? - So.

131
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:48,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we should consider selling.

132
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

133
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:55,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica, this place is fabulous.

134
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so much closer to us,

135
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'd get to see you way more often.

136
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And with your half of what we could get for the house,

137
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:03,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'd be set for the rest of your life.

138
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't about me. This is about money.

139
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know we've been struggling.

140
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Print media is dead.

141
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:18,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ian's working at Starbucks.

142
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to have to send Alice to public school.

143
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:23,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she so had her heart set on St. Bridget's.

144
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to deprive my child.

145
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a live-in nanny.

146
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:29,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, actually, that's not really working out.

147
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barb, this is my home.

148
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:40,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica, I know this is hard.

149
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But do you really think you can manage here all by yourself?

150
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom would have wanted you to be taken care of.

151
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all she ever wanted.

152
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:55,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're back.

153
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You found him. - He was in the bathroom.

154
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:00,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

155
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:06,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think Grandma would have wanted you to take care of him.

156
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:08,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was obviously sent here by mistake.

157
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must belong to someone else.

158
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Alice, you already have too many dolls as it is.

159
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but Chucky's my friend till the end!

160
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I actually think it's a really nice gesture.

161
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Aunty Nica.

162
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a doll.

163
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:25,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the worst that can happen, huh?

164
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like to be hugged.

165
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like to hug you, too, Chucky.

166
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that, Chucky?

167
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:47,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chucky wants to know what's for dinner.

168
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:54,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I better get started in the kitchen.

169
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be silly.

170
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are my guests and you must be exhausted from your flight,

171
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}please just make yourselves at home.

172
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:02,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father Frank, you will stay for dinner, won't you?

173
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:08,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'd love to, Nica. Thanks.

174
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:12,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to make dinner. For six.

175
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven.

176
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I will need a chef's assistant.

177
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:20,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Chucky can be my assistant.

178
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:22,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Let's get cooking.

179
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's really good. - It's the oregano.

180
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:57,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you finish setting the table? - Almost.

181
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:05,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pay the toll. - We're on a roll.

182
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:30,888


183
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:38,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, honey, don't touch that. Can you grab me the napkins?

184
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fancy ones from last Christmas.

185
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This smells delicious.

186
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - Come on, Chucky.

187
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this, Nica.

188
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've really outdone yourself this time.

189
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:52,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are going to sit right here.

190
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:55,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Barb, sit next to me here. - Okay. If you insist.

191
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at this. - Thanks, Jill. Make yourself comfortable.

192
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:00,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You brought out the nice china.

193
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:06,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, would you like to say grace?

194
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bless us, oh Lord, and these Thy gifts

195
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:15,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which we are about to receive from Thy bounty.

196
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop. - Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray.

197
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:22,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amen.

198
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jill? - Thank you, Ian.

199
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:32,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't mind if I do. - How about you, Father?

200
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'm good.

201
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:41,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am starving.

202
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:43,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

203
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your daddy would like to make a toast.

204
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:50,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the chef.

205
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:53,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. I had a great assistant.

206
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I love chili. - Do you really?

207
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:58,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - Me, too. Love it.

208
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is there meat in this? - No. Not at all.

209
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:05,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's vegetarian.

210
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

211
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:23,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my God. - What?

212
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:28,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is amazing!

213
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:31,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I can't believe there's no meat in this.

214
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:32,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so hearty.

215
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the oregano.

216
00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:37,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is just the way my mama used to make it.

217
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:40,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica, could you pass me the salt?

218
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

219
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:52,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, that doll, it looks really familiar somehow.

220
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, come on.

221
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:56,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good Guy dolls were all the rage back in the 80s.

222
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:58,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My brother even had one. - So did mine.

223
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:00,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you serious? - Yes.

224
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:03,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on.

225
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:05,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I seem to remember seeing them on the news?

226
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember seeing people standing in line overnight

227
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just to get their hands on one of these.

228
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:12,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were right up there with Smurfs and Cabbage Patch Kids.

229
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:53,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Alice, honey, is something wrong? - It tastes funny.

230
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we put too much oregano in.

231
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:00,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice, sweetheart, it's not that bad.

232
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat it.

233
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, are you all right?

234
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to be going.

235
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:17,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my God, Father, are you ill? - Oh, no, I'm fine.

236
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:20,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an appointment back at the church.

237
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica, thank you so much, the chili was delicious.

238
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Father, are you? - No, please forgive me.

239
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:27,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't mean to be rude.

240
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:31,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you all in the morning at the cemetery.

241
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

242
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry.

243
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:26,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where is he? - This way.

244
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:29,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What happened? - Lost control, hit them head on.

245
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:31,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably drunk.

246
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, this isn't right. I know him, I'm in his parish.

247
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:37,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He doesn't drink anymore. - You sure about that?

248
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:39,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my sponsor.

249
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:42,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stanton, you're going to need a drink after you see this.

250
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:50,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

251
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:53,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steel's got him pinned. He's lost a shitload of blood,

252
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we just can't tell from where.

253
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, can you hear me? Father?

254
00:26:59,074 --> 00:27:01,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just hang on! We're going to get you out.

255
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:04,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you waiting for? Get this shit off him!

256
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:05,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't make that call.

257
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's bleeding to death! Get him out!

258
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay, set in. - On my count.

259
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, pull.

260
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is an oldie.

261
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:01,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Is that you?

262
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:04,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shut up. - You're so cute.

263
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:05,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called baby fat.

264
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:08,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I didn't say anything.

265
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go back to sleep. - Will do.

266
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at her.

267
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's so happy.

268
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:33,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to your dad?

269
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:36,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He drowned that year,

270
00:28:37,222 --> 00:28:39,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}couple of weeks before Nica was born.

271
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom was never the same after that.

272
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:02,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

273
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some neighbor back in Chicago, I guess.

274
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a weirdo.

275
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:14,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey there, missy, what'cha up to? - Chucky's gone.

276
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:17,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not again. - Well, where did you leave him?

277
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:20,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't. He's hiding.

278
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, time for bed.

279
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:28,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't forget to brush your teeth and your hair.

280
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:31,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What about Chucky? - Jill will go look for Chucky.

281
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:37,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll give you a hand, Jill. - We're not done here yet.

282
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:42,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's hiding under my bed.

283
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:43,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, we'll find him.

284
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:01,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to be right back.

285
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:22,424


286
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure you didn't leave him downstairs?

287
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:19,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't leave him anywhere. He's hiding.

288
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:22,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he goes!

289
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:25,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not in the mood for this.

290
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:02,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Need a hand? - I need a fucking search party!

291
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:04,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have looked over every inch of this house

292
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:06,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I can't find him anywhere.

293
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:16,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- God, I've missed you. - Shut up.

294
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:19,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You found him.

295
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she wanted you to find him.

296
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:36,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I haven't been spending enough time with her.

297
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like if I'm not working, I'm just so tired all the time.

298
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:41,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Life is short!

299
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:49,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did they always say that? - I don't know.

300
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:50,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, little man, what else are you,

301
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}telling my kid behind my back, huh?

302
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like to be hugged.

303
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:57,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And? - Wanna play?

304
00:34:57,549 --> 00:35:00,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that it? - Hi. I'm Chucky.

305
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm your friend till the end.

306
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one's a classic.

307
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:08,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it works on so many different levels.

308
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, the 80s were awesome.

309
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:12,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you find him yet?

310
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we found him!

311
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take him up.

312
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:29,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ian?

313
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:40,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone?

314
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:58,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

315
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

316
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:14,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming!

317
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:20,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, with her, it's always something.

318
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She needs my help and then resents me for it.

319
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:26,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the only one who really appreciates me.

320
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I was thinking.

321
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:38,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can get by without the money.

322
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:40,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to sell.

323
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, this is her home.

324
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a mess. You can see that.

325
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, crap.

326
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are, Chucky!

327
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:28,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been looking for you everywhere.

328
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:33,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, want to play?

329
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know you could do that.

330
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Playtime's over. It's time for bed.

331
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:40,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you read us a bedtime story?

332
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aunty Nica's tired, sweetie. We'll let her rest now.

333
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:44,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine.

334
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:46,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's important that you don't overextend yourself.

335
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:02,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you think I'm the best judge of when I'm overextending myself?

336
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:06,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Frankly, no. - Really.

337
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you realize the strain you're under.

338
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no shame in admitting that you need help.

339
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean "assistance."

340
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:21,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nica, I am worried about your heart. Okay?

341
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Masur said I was fine, Barb.

342
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:28,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're at significant risk of it happening again, you know that.

343
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:32,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- 13% of all T5 paraplegics... - I know the statistics.

344
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:34,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Masur said that extreme stress,

345
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}any kind of even mild shock could bring it on.

346
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:40,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And since last night, God knows you've had plenty of both.

347
00:39:46,528 --> 00:39:49,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice, sweetheart, please come down from there.

348
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:53,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm disabled, Barb, I am not a child.

349
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.

350
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:03,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aunty Nica, you're bleeding.

351
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my God. - I got it. Okay?

352
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:13,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It almost looks like a knife wound.

353
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:16,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must have cut yourself making dinner.

354
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:19,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't. - Doesn't it hurt?

355
00:40:20,273 --> 00:40:22,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, don't worry, sweetie.

356
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:24,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She can't feel a thing.

357
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:30,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, come on. Come on. Off to bed now.

358
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:32,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Aunty Nica.

359
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:36,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, baby. Sweet dreams.

360
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I lay me down to sleep,

361
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:05,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

362
00:41:05,654 --> 00:41:07,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I shall die before I wake,

363
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:10,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pray the Lord my soul to take.

364
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:15,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God bless Grandma, and Mommy, and Daddy, and Jill.

365
00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:17,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And especially Aunty Nica.

366
00:41:20,337 --> 00:41:21,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Chucky?

367
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says there is no God.

368
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:26,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who said that? - Chucky did.

369
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:29,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said that life's a bitch and then you die,

370
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}bleeding like a stuck pig.

371
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:34,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice. You know it's not nice to curse.

372
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:37,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't curse, Mommy. Chucky did.

373
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:46,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy, am I going to die?

374
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:50,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Of course not, sweetie.

375
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:54,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandma died. And Chucky says we're all going to die.

376
00:41:57,836 --> 00:42:00,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice, who really told you that?

377
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:01,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Was it Jill? - No.

378
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:04,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Was it your daddy? - No, it was Chucky.

379
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

380
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:26,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't we sleep in with you tonight?

381
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice, we've talked about this. You're a big girl now.

382
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only a storm.

383
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:34,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Jill's going to be in in a while.

384
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't forget Chucky!

385
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:16,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Chucky. It's only a storm.

386
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:37,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ma'am, thank you for holding. The package...

387
00:43:38,736 --> 00:43:40,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evidence depository.

388
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:44,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

389
00:43:44,427 --> 00:43:46,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say "evidence depository"?

390
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Hello, are you there?

391
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chucky, I'm scared.

392
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:55,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking should be.

393
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:34,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

394
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We found him.

395
00:45:38,741 --> 00:45:41,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She sure loves that thing. - Yeah. She sure does.

396
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:46,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know, I just called the delivery company,

397
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they said it was sent from an evidence depository.

398
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:54,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As in crime scene evidence?

399
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:58,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Maybe I heard them wrong. The connection was bad.

400
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:01,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure that's it.

401
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:04,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but we still don't know who sent it.

402
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:09,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care if it was the Manson Family.

403
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:11,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything that keeps her this happy is fine by me.

404
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's been so sad lately.

405
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:21,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I better get to bed. Long day tomorrow.

406
00:46:25,124 --> 00:46:27,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night. - Good night, Jill.

407
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:18,278


408
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:21,446


409
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:29,220


410
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:32,496


411
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:41,982


412
00:47:46,223 --> 00:47:48,326

00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:47,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or I could just check the footage.

00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:55,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What nanny cam? - The one I hid in the doll today.

446
00:53:02,595 --> 00:53:05,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are not taking my daughter away from me. Do you hear me?

00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:46,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it isn't my fault that you chose to never leave this goddamned house.

551
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:33,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell have you done with my daughter, Nica?

552
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:35,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ian, where's Chucky? - You're sick!

560
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:58,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll never find me in here, Chucky.

561
01:10:58,673 --> 01:11:01,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the best game of hide and seek ever.

01:11:01,092 --> 01:11:03,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

563
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:06,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chucky, stop cursing.

564

01:12:26,518 --> 01:12:28,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe not.

567
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:36,194

574
01:15:51,488 --> 01:15:54,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't your mother ever mention me?

575
01:15:55,577 --> 01:15:58,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm an old friend of the family.

01:16:24,608 --> 01:16:26,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right against my rib cage.

581
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:29,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soon enough. Cannot come soon enough.

01:16:51,303 --> 01:16:54,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such a nice, happy family.

01:17:36,102 --> 01:17:37,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like 'em?

591
01:17:51,952 --> 01:17:54,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're beautiful, thank you.

592
01:17:54,997 --> 01:17:58,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Difficult to find right now. They're not exactly in season.

593
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, enjoy.

594
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:02,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gettin' late,

595
01:18:02,453 --> 01:18:04,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm gonna go pick up Barbie at day care.

596
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:05,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

597
01:18:08,386 --> 01:18:12,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, shouldn't we have some time alone together?

598
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:17,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about family time?

599
01:18:18,272 --> 01:18:19,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Later.

600
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now I want to have you all to myself.

601
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:30,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah. Sarah, you've had me all day.

602
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:34,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It isn't enough.

603
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:39,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a selfish fucking attitude for a mother to take.

604
01:18:42,006 --> 01:18:44,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't wanna share me with her?

605
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:48,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No.

606
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:53,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what's gonna happen when the baby comes?

607
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna keep her from me, too? Because...

608
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:00,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that would be very hurtful to me.

609
01:19:02,695 --> 01:19:05,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you wouldn't wanna see me get hurt, would you?

610
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you?

611
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:12,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you? - No. No.

612
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:14,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna see you get hurt.

613
01:19:14,594 --> 01:19:16,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna see anybody get hurt.

614
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:19,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

615
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:22,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go get Barbie.

616
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Please, please! Please don't.

617
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:38,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

618
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:41,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told them about us?

619
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:45,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no us.

620
01:19:50,038 --> 01:19:51,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

621
01:19:52,332 --> 01:19:57,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you want to destroy this family?

622
01:19:57,379 --> 01:20:00,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You destroyed my family.

623
01:20:04,845 --> 01:20:06,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

624
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you,

625
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:13,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always had a thing for families.

626
01:20:14,105 --> 01:20:15,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

627
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially kids.

628
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:25,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did this to me?

629
01:20:30,373 --> 01:20:34,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Nica, you did this to me.

630
01:20:35,087 --> 01:20:37,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and your mommy.

631
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:42,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She betrayed me.

632
01:20:44,179 --> 01:20:45,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got me killed.

633
01:20:50,436 --> 01:20:53,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I knew a way to come back.

634
01:20:58,737 --> 01:20:59,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the power.

635
01:20:59,905 --> 01:21:02,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I beg of you!

636
01:21:16,923 --> 01:21:19,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Took me 25 years,

637
01:21:21,428 --> 01:21:23,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but believe me,

638
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:26,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it was worth the wait.

639
01:21:29,687 --> 01:21:32,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}25 years.

640
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:37,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since then, a lot of families have come and gone.

641
01:21:37,237 --> 01:21:41,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Barclays, the Kincaids, the Tillys,

642
01:21:42,034 --> 01:21:47,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Nica, your family was always my favorite.

643
01:21:48,498 --> 01:21:52,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, you're the last one standing.

644
01:21:54,339 --> 01:21:55,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So to speak.

645
01:21:59,302 --> 01:22:03,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you remind me a lot of Andy Barclay.

646
01:22:03,307 --> 01:22:06,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a whiny little bitch, just like you.

647
01:22:06,936 --> 01:22:08,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you kill him, too?

648
01:22:08,604 --> 01:22:09,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More or less.

649
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I killed his childhood.

650
01:22:13,984 --> 01:22:17,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the truth is, I killed you 25 years ago.

651
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:19,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't I, Nica?

652
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't been living.

653
01:22:22,202 --> 01:22:25,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't call this living.

654
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've just been on life support.

655
01:22:30,711 --> 01:22:32,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to pull the fucking plug.

656
01:22:33,047 --> 01:22:36,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you never actually killed Andy Barclay, did you?

657
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

658
01:22:39,513 --> 01:22:41,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's called completion anxiety.

659
01:22:41,848 --> 01:22:43,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very common in males.

660
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:47,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a male, aren't you?

661
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill you slow.

662
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, no, I get that.

663
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:02,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}25 years. Must be the slowest murder in history.

664
01:23:04,205 --> 01:23:07,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what are you waiting for? A sign from God?

665
01:23:10,379 --> 01:23:11,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

666
01:23:28,565 --> 01:23:30,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You feel that, don't ya?

667
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:50,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna play, motherfucker? Let's play.

668
01:25:22,855 --> 01:25:24,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police. Open up.

669

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Help me!

670
01:26:32,222 --> 01:26:33,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Based on the evidence,

671
01:26:33,774 --> 01:26:36,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the defendant is declared legally incompetent

672
01:26:36,893 --> 01:26:41,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and remanded indefinitely to a facility for the criminally insane.

673
01:27:03,839 --> 01:27:05,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm alive, you son of a bitch. You hear me?

674
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:09,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still alive!

675
01:27:10,805 --> 01:27:12,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still alive!

676

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please leave a message.

677
01:27:52,099 --> 01:27:54,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it's me. I'm on my way.

678
01:27:54,255 --> 01:27:56,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't forget my money.

679
01:28:21,715 --> 01:28:23,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They never learn.

680
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:29,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So who's next?

681
01:28:31,934 --> 01:28:33,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next.

682
01:28:41,736 --> 01:28:42,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good afternoon.

683
01:28:43,113 --> 01:28:45,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three-day, two-day, or overnight?

684
01:28:45,365 --> 01:28:48,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Overnight. It's extremely urgent.

685
01:28:48,577 --> 01:28:49,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fragile?

686
01:28:50,997 --> 01:28:52,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surprisingly not.

687
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:56,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Approximate value?

688
01:28:56,586 --> 01:28:59,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, my mother always used to say

689
01:28:59,193 --> 01:29:01,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can't put a price on love.

690
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:05,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Under 250, then.

691
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:07,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to insure the package?

692
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:09,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that won't be necessary.

693
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:12,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It protects you and it protects the recipient.

694
01:29:12,937 --> 01:29:14,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I doubt that.

695
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perishable goods? Live animal?

696
01:29:20,111 --> 01:29:22,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just put "other."

697
01:29:30,831 --> 01:29:32,961

703
01:29:46,723 --> 01:29:50,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you know, Bunny has won 17,000...

704

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Grandma?

707
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the cellar.

708
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:13,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's she doing down there?

709
01:30:13,794 --> 01:30:15,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothin'.

710
01:30:15,171 --> 01:30:18,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chucky, Mommy and Daddy are dead.

711
01:30:18,675 --> 01:30:20,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aunty Nica killed them.

712
01:30:20,635 --> 01:30:23,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm your friend till the end, Alice.

713
01:30:24,472 --> 01:30:28,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now it's time to play.

714
01:30:28,686 --> 01:30:29,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide and seek?

715
01:30:29,979 --> 01:30:32,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide the soul.

716
01:30:32,189 --> 01:30:34,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And guess what?

717

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're it.

718
01:30:36,819 --> 01:30:38,529
