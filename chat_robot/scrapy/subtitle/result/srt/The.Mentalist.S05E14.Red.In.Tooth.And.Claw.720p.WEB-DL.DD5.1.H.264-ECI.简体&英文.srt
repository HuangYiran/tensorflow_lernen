我们有个扑克牌局
Listen, there's this poker game we've got going on.

00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,870
-想来吗  -也许吧  什么时候

It's a pretty high-class crowd.

12

你早跟我说一声就好了
I wish you would have warned me.

13
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,270
我想这位你认识  对吗
Oh, I think you know this guy, right?

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,750
特蕾莎  我没想过你会喜欢赌博
Teresa. I didn't take you for a gambler.

15
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,170
如果知道自己赢定了  就不算是赌了
It's not gambling if you know you're gonna win.

加注一千
Raise it $1,000.

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,830
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

Uh, Greg. Uh, Gregory Lewis.

61
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,500
我是大约午夜的时候发现她的
I found her around midnight.

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,030
说说事发经过
Tell me what happened.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,490
全凭运气  我找到了一只非常好的树鼩
Well, by sheer luck, I-I happened upon a very nice tree shrew.

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,100
我从未研究过树鼩
Um, I've never examined one before,

65
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,860
就把它带回来准备去除皮肉
and I-I brought it in to strip the flesh off.

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,780
就是只保留骨架
You know, to keep the skeleton.

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,130
这怎么做
How do you do that?

68
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,550
把它们放到这些箱子里
Oh, w-we put 'em in these tanks.

69
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,060
这又怎么把骨架和皮肉分离开来
How does that strip them of their flesh?

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,140
-食尸虫  -食尸虫  对
- Flesh-eating bugs. - Flesh-eating bugs. Right.

为何要弃尸于虫箱里
Why dump a body into a beetle tank?

96
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,890
博物馆安保措置不佳
The museum doesn't have great security,

97
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,340
但也没到能随随便便把尸体运出去的地步
but it's not the kind of place you can sneak a body out of.

98
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,920
除非尸体小到能装进行李袋
Unless you make it small enough to fit in a duffel bag.

99
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,570
凶手是在等虫子将尸体啃食至
So the killer was waiting for the bugs to eat it

100
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
只剩骨架  然后再偷运出去
down to the skeleton so they could sneak it out?

101
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,380
有可能  我们在箱子里发现了一件科学器械
Possibly. Uh, we found a scientific tool in the tank.

102
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,760
有可能是凶器
It could be the murder weapon.

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
凶手也许也是一名科学家
So the killer's probably another scientist then.

104
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,940
或者是博物馆的工作人员
Or someone that works at the museum.

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,490
最后一次看见琳达是什么时候

108
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,140
约塞米蒂国家公园做什么研究去了

后来有人注意到她的车停在校园里

You got it, boss.

123
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,140
我们以为她在山里迷路了
We thought she was lost in the mountains.

124
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,030
没想到她一直都在这里
But she was here the whole time.

125
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,530
简直太可怕了
It's too horrible for words.

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,820
她研究什么  研究哪种动物
What did she study? What kind of animal?

127
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,880
有什么关系吗
Why does that matter?

128
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,610
没有人会因为偶然而选择其终身事业
Nobody picks what they dedicate their life to by accident.

129
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,880
都是有原因的
It says something.

130
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,880
我研究灵长类动物大脑
I study primate brains.

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,620
这能说明我是怎样的人
What does that say about me?

132
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,650
你有一些阴暗的思想
You have dark thoughts inside your head

133
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,110
但你觉得它们很正常很自然
that you want to believe are normal and natural.

134
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,180
当然它们确实是那样
Which they are, of course.

135
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
琳达是研究鸟类的
Linda was an ornithologist.

136
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,380
她的博士生项目是研究北扑翅鴷的饮食
Her doctorate was on the diet of the northern flicker.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,540
北扑翅鴷是一种啄木鸟
A kind of woodpecker.

138
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,690
有意思
Interesting.

139
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,770
啄木鸟十分执着
Tenacious.

140
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,800
不断用头撞树直到问题解决
Bang their head against the problem until they solve it.

141
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,440
琳达也是这种性格吗
Was that Linda?

142
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,590
是的
It was.

143
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,160
但是啄木鸟并不是用头撞树
Although woodpeckers don't bang their heads

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,530
而是用喙在树上钻洞
against things so much as they use their bills to drill holes.

145
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,420
的确  潜意识这东西
Yes. Well, the subconscious mind is--

146
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,520
没那么准
isn't really a stickler about that kind of thing.

147
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,410
她是个好学生吗
Uh, was she a good student?

148

她很聪明
Brilliant.

149
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,680
她已经和人合作在著名期刊上
She had already co-authored several papers

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,000
发表了好几篇论文了
in prestigious journals.

151
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,790
有谁嫉妒她吗
Well, who was jealous?

152
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,880
没有
Nobody.

153
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,610
我们的生物系在整个西海岸是顶尖的
This is the top biology department on the west coast.

154
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,810
这里的人都是精英
Best and brightest only.

155
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,610
每一个人的成功对我们都有好处
The success of one of us helps all of us.

156
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,040
我们是一家人
We're a family.

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,060
每天都有谋害亲人的事发生
Well, people murder family members every day.

158
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,360
这很自然
It's natural.

159
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,150
谋杀是一件自然的事
Murder is natural.

160
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,170
但却不正常
But abnormal.

161
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,860
教授们不会了解丑闻
Teachers don't know there's scandals

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,820
除非他们自己深陷其中
unless of course they are the scandal.

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,720
你们问完了吗
Are we done?

164
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,780
暂时问完了
Yeah. For now.

165
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,520
我们得跟几个学生谈谈
Uh, we're gonna need to talk to some students

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,210
还得去一趟礼品店
and visit the gift shop,

167
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,950
出门左拐  对吗
which is left out the door, isn't it?

168
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,160
打扰一下  你在做什么
Excuse me. What are you doing?

169
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,180
你们是什么人
Who are you?

170
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,770
我是瑞斯比探员  这位是周探员
I'm Agent Rigsby. This is Agent Cho.

171
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,040

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,260
我是琳达博士课题的同学

174
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,000
我的办公室就在隔壁
And I have the office next door.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

176
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,170
我想在你们把这里封锁之前
I just came to get my copy of "Understanding macro-evolution"

177
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,270
拿走我的《理解宏观进化》的拷贝
before you guys sealed the place off.

178
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,010
你跟琳达熟悉吗
Did you know Linda well?

179
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,280
她是这里的明星
She was a rock star.

180
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,030
也许需要打扮下  但确实是明星
A rock star who could use a makeover, but still.

181
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,520
她拿到了今年的院长奖学金
She got the Dean's fellowship this year.

182
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,220
大约有10万块
That's like 100 grand.

183
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,430
而我们这些人只能用社保金
The rest of us will be paying off our student loans

184
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,150
去交我们的助学贷款
with our social security checks.

185
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,830
怎么会有这么多动物标本
What's with all the taxidermy?

186
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,790
琳达不是研究啄木鸟的吗
I thought Linda just studied woodpeckers.

187
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,450
管理标本室是琳达勤工俭学的工作
No, Linda managed the specimen rooms for her work-study,

188
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,750
她精力旺盛嘛
so she got the overflow.

189
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,050
毒品吗
Huh. Drugs?

190
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,090
是糖
Sugar.

191
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,670
她不吸毒

193
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,790
她的私生活怎么样
What about her personal life?

194
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,530
-什么意思  -她有男朋友吗
- What about it? - Did she have one?

195
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,030
我们没怎么谈论过这个话题
We didn't talk about that stuff very much.

196

我知道她有个校外的男朋友

197

但仅此而已

我想我找到琳达的同学了
I think I found Linda's classmates.

200
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,770
在大象这边
Look for the elephants.

201
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,770
大多数的物种在很长一段时间都不进化
Most species stay in stasis for long periods of time.

202
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,740

206
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,080
非常敬重
from the students.

207
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,340
我在基德教授手下教课
Uh, I teach a couple seminars under Dr. Kidd.

208
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,640
抱歉打断你了
I'm sorry to interrupt,

209
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,990
我是来调查琳达·帕弗瑞的情况的
but I'm looking for information on Linda Parfrey.

210
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,550
这些都是她的同学  对吗
These are her classmates, right?

211
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,530
对  我们都认识琳达

我们知道琳达有个男友

我们想找他谈谈
Uh, we'd like to talk to him.

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,290
应该是前男友吧
Ex-boyfriend, I guess.

217
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,370
她不怎么谈这事  可有一晚在实验室
She didn't talk much about it, but late one night in the lab,

218
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,710
她告诉我他们分手了
she told me they broke up.

219
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,970
什么时候的事
When was that?

220
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,260
大概是她失踪前一周
About a week before she went missing.

221
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,600
你不会怀疑是他干的吧
You don't think he did it, do you?

222
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,050
他可是个警察
I mean, he's a cop.

Put Cho on it. Jane, too, if he ever comes in.

229
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,430

230
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,590
头儿
Hey, boss?

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,190
可还是很棒

236
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,680
大家都会想你的
The team's gonna miss you.

237
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,000
你说会帮我向伯特仑申请助学金的

245
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,230
她给我介绍的时候我都听不太明白
I don't know what she's saying when she talks about it.

246
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,400
我想马上申请培训津贴

248
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,630

《月亮晚安》  他说
You know, "Goodnight moon," he says--

253
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,860
那是什么意思

254
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,330
只是打牌而已
It's just a game.

255
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,530

286
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,610
可我得先把手头的事处理完
but we gotta handle this, okay?

287
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,440
我过几个小时找你们吧
Let me catch up with you in a couple hours.

288
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,500
-几个小时  -对  我们刚接警
- A couple hours? - Yeah, we just got this.

289
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,340
我们得发布犯罪通报
I mean, we gotta put out a crime broadcast.

290
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,030
还得片区巡逻
We gotta cruise the neighborhood.

291
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,530
然后写报告
Then there's the paperwork.

292
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,190
你的报告我是爱莫能助了
Well, can't help you with the paperwork.

293
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,680
-他戴着兜帽  走进来  -你为什么把钱给他
- He had a hood. He came in... - Why'd you give him the money?

294
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,710
先生  请由我们来问话
Sir, we're asking the questions here.

295
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,420
告诉我事发经过
Just tell me what happened.

296
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,710
我从收银机取钱时这家伙走进来
So this dude comes up while I'm cashing out the register,

297
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,120
问我要名片
asks for a calling card.

298
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,270
我只转过身一秒钟
I just turned for one second,

299
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,740
他就把手伸进窗口抢了一摞20块
and he reached through the gap and grabbed a stack of $20s.

300
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,320
你得等到取完钞
You wait until you're finished cashing out

301
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,020
才能做另一笔交易
before you do another transaction!

302
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,780
听着  这家伙拿着钱
Look, the guy had money.

303
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,980
他看上去没什么可疑的
He didn't look shady or anything.

304
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,400
我怎么会知道他会抢钱
How was I supposed to know?

305
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,900
请问
Hey. Excuse me.

306
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,910
给我演示一下他手伸进来够钱的情景
Show me how he reached through the gap again.

307
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,690
好了  手缩回去
All right. Pull your hand out.

308
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,290
这就是抓浣熊的方法  你知道吗
That's how they catch a raccoon, you know that?

309
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,990
这么说  那家伙没法通过这个口抢钱
So the guy couldn't have grabbed the cash through the gap.

310
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,290
根本没有这个人  是吗  哥们
There wasn't another guy, was there, buddy?

311
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,620
是你  你就是小偷
You! You're the thief!

312
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,410
我是小偷
I'm the thief?

313
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,760
你就是小偷
You're the thief.

314
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,520
你就付我那么点工资  反倒说我是小偷
With what you're paying me, I'm the thief?

315
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,550
活儿干完了  哥们
Work's done here, buddy.

316
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,760
我想你们可以把小偷带去做笔录了
I think you can get your man to do the paperwork.

317
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,970
听着
Look--

318
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,850
不不不
No, no, no.

319
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,000
你和琳达什么时候认识的
When did you and Linda meet?

320
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,380
去年  我在值夜班
Last year. I was moonlighting,

321
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,580
在博物馆做安保
doing security at the museum.

322
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,000
你们的感情生活如何
And how was the relationship?

323
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,030
她的生活比我认识的任何人都稳当
Her life was more together than anybody I ever met.

324
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,320
她很专注
She was so focused.

325
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,790
我想也感染到了我
Got to me, too, I guess.

326
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,110
我甚至开始为警官考试做准备
I even started studying for the sergeant's exam.

327
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,410
然后把她给甩了
Mm-hmm. And then you dumped her?

328
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,460
-你以为我不难过吗  -这要你告诉我们
- You think I was happy about it? - You tell me.

329
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,990
大约两个月前  我收到了一封匿名电邮
About two months ago I got an anonymous e-mail

330
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,310
里面有个链接
with a link in it

331
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,260
是她网上的约会资料
to her online dating profile.

332
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,470
我无法相信
I couldn't believe it.

333
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,440
她已经在和别人交往了吗
And she'd started seeing other people?

334
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,660
我不知道有没有
I... I don't know if she started.

335
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,960
她只是在看有没有更好的
She was just shopping around.

336
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,250
可能她一直都这样吧
Maybe she'd been doing it the whole time.

337
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,340
-你和她聊过这事吗  -聊过
- You talk to her about it? - Yeah.

338
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,500
大吵了一架
Big fight.

339
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,100
你对她动粗了吗
You get rough with her?

340
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,860
没  我不干这种事
Mnh. I don't have that in me.

341
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,480
我不会伤害女人  尤其是琳达
Hurt a woman? Especially not Linda.

342
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,930
她有解释吗
She have an explanation?

343
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,990
她不承认  不过她还能怎么样呢
She denied it, you know, but what else was she gonna do?

344
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,270
我无法接受她脚踏两条船  只好放手了
I can't take cheating. I had to let her go.

345
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,930
你知道资料是谁发给你的吗
Mm-hmm. Did you know who sent you the profile?

346
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,790
-不知道  -你不好奇吗
- No. - And you weren't curious?

347
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,060
我不知道  我...
I don't know. I...

348
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,060
某个人的女友和我同病相怜
Some guy's girlfriend's in the same boat as me,

349
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,620
有人心存怨恨
somebody's holding a grudge.

350
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,510
唯一重要的是  我配不上她
Only thing that mattered was I wasn't enough for her.

351
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,670
分手后  你没再和她联系过吗
And after you broke up, you never spoke to her again?

352
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,660
没
No.

353
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,810
我早该知道的
I should have known.

354
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,830
她很有头脑
You know, she had smarts.

355
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,030
她会大有作为
She was gonna have a big life.

356
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,110
她怎么会想要我这样的小人物呢
What'd she want with a mook like me, right?

357
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,660
有什么进展吗
Do you have something?

358
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,930
这是别人传给莫兰的约会资料
Here's the dating profile somebody sent Moran.

359
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,760
{\pos(198.6,184.8)}东方海湾

360
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,080
查查这个交友网站
Get a hold of the dating site.

361
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,050
看是否有人在她失踪前后联系过她
See if anybody contacted her around the time she went missing.

362
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,040
我觉得琳达没和人约会
I don't think Linda went on any dates.

363
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,090
为什么
Well, why not?

364
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,980
发送莫兰这封电邮的地址
The address that sent Moran the e-mail

365
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,760
正是建立这个交友账户的邮箱地址
was used to set up an account with the dating site.

366
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,520
你找到了吗
Did you find them?

367
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,290
算是吧  我登陆了账户
Sort of. I logged into the account.

368
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,990
你不需要密码吗
Don't you need a password for that?

369
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,590
我用最常见的密码试了两分钟
I spent two minutes using the most common passwords.

370
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,920
是"Qwerty"
It was "Qwerty."

371
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,950
"Qwerty"
"Qwerty"?

372
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,850
Q-w-e-r-t-y
Q-w-e-r-t-y.

373
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,230
这是最常见的密码第五位
It's the fifth most common password.

374
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,830
猜猜是谁的资料
Guess whose profile it was.

375
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
琳达
Linda.

376
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,750
那发给莫兰资料的人就是创建账户的人
So whoever sent Moran the profile also created it.

377
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,450
对  资料是伪造的
Yep. Profile's a fake.

378
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,940
有人想拆散琳达和莫兰警官
Someone was trying to break up Linda and officer Moran.

379
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,690
干得好
Nice work. Mm.

380
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,240
听着  我知道你没去成培训计划很失望
Look, I know you're disappointed about the training program.

381
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,080
我们明年送你去
We'll get you in next year.

382
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,360
没事
It's fine.

383
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,440
伯特仑本应该打的得心应手
Bertram's supposed to be this real smooth player,

384
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,250
但他却输了好几把牌
but he loses a couple of hands of poker

385
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,090
还惹恼了跟他打牌的人
and he has to bum everybody else out.

386
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,450
琳达想找一个"身材火辣的男人"
Linda wanted "A man with a super hot body."

387
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,470
你是在说伪造的交友简介
The fake dating profile, right?

388
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,850
你刚才在说什么
You were saying something?

389
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,910
伯特仑把范佩尔给坑惨了
Bertram hanging Van Pelt out to dry.

390
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,000
他打牌输了很多钱  就变得歇斯底里了
He's just mad because he's losing big money at poker.

391
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,610
有些人就是喜欢把他们的痛苦凌驾于他人之上
Well, some people like to push their pain onto other people,

392
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,520
软弱的人  总是有人更软弱的
weaker people, and there's always someone weaker.

393
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,000
这就是生命的轮回啊
That's just the circle of life.

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,180
好吧
Cheery.

395
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,440
里斯本  伯特仑不是想赢  是必须赢
Bertram doesn't want to win, Lisbon, he has to.

396
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,300
所以他才会在现在的位子上
It's why he is where he is.

397
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,220
对他而言  输是不可忍受的
The idea of losing is just intolerable to him.

398
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,630
为什么会有人想拆散琳达和她男友呢
Why would somebody want to break Linda and her boyfriend up?

399
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,950
情敌
Romantic rivalry?

400
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,480
有可能
Yeah, possibly.

401
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,450
"我在找有头脑  有肌肉  全面的男人"
"I'm looking for brains, brawn, the total package."

402
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,800
范佩尔试着追踪电子邮件
Van Pelt's trying to trace the e-mail,

403
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,110
但毫无收获
but she hit a dead end.

404
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,650
不管是谁做的肯定留下了线索
Well, whoever authored this left their fingerprints all over it.

405
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,100
"半吊子不行"
"No half-steppers.

406
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,140
"我在找一个真正的坏小子
"A genuine badass.

407
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,040
装点我的小巢"
Feather my nest."

408
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,900
把人都喊来  里斯本
Gather the troops, Lisbon.

409
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,910
为啥
Why?

410
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,400
咱们来玩宾果游戏
It's time to play bingo.

411
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,710
我们从伪造的约会资料里提取了一些词
So we have a list of words from the fake dating profile.

412
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,000
我们和学生们谈谈
We talk to the students

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,170
对比学生们的用词
and compare what they say to the words in the list,

414
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,370
如果他们的用词和列表上的词相吻合
and if what they say matches up with the words on the list,

415
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,500
那他们就是伪造资料的人吗
Then they're the one that wrote the profile?

416
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,740
你说的没错
So far, so good.

417
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,450
但我们怎么让他们说出这些词呢
But how do we get them to say the right words?

418
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,460
我们该问他们些什么
What do we ask them about?

419
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,070
让他们不停的说话就行了
You have to try to get their words flowing.

420
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,610
-谈谈他们喜欢的东西  -喜欢的东西
- Talk to them about their passions. - Their passions?

421
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,290
当然是动物
Animals, of course.

422
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,630
虫子  以及小动物
Bugs. Critters.

423
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,080
人们用"冷血"来表示邪恶
People use "Coldblooded" to mean evil,

424
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,770
就好像物种的体温调节特性
as if a species' thermophysiology

425
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,890
能够决定它们的道德属性一样
could determine its moral attributes.

426
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,970
这太荒唐了
That's ridiculous.

427
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,510
爬行动物永远也发明不了原子弹
Reptiles never invented the atomic bomb.

428
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,330
要我说  恒温动物才是问题的所在
If you ask me, warm blood is the problem.

429
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,210
明白我的意思吗
Know what I mean?

430
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,350
失陪一下
Excuse me.

431
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,900
说说...骷髅吧
So... skeletons.

432
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
你为什么喜欢骷髅
Why are you into them?

433
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,590
为什么一定要有原因呢
Why do I need a reason?

434
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,140
我就当你是不正常了
I'll just go with "Weird."

435
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,120
这就像是在我们的五脏六腑之下
It's, like, under all this viscera we wear,

436
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,420
有一些很强壮  很干净  
there's--well, there's something strong and--and clean

437
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,030
很美丽的东西  把它们组合在了一起
and--and beautiful that--that holds us together.

438
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,850
没它们还真不行  我觉得这很酷
You can't lose it. I think--I think that's cool.

439
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,640
我通过了吗
Did I pass?

440
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,040
我之前接受过精神分析测试
I've taken a psych test before.

441
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,790
简先生
Mr. Jane.

442
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,710
我们刚才还谈到了你
We were just discussing you.

443
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,620
帕帕达基斯院长和我说了你惊人的记忆力
Dean Papadakis told me about your impressive memory.

444
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,250
我现在的记忆力大不如前了
My own memory isn't as good as it used to be.

445
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,540
你有什么秘诀吗
What's your secret?

446
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,090
不要忘记就行了
It's easy to remember when you never forget.

447
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,450
你在做什么
What you doing?

448
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,900
放置捕捉飞蛾的诱饵
Laying bait for moths.

449
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,780
它们喜欢甜味
They like sweetness,

450
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,460
所以我就用芝麻蕉和啤酒做饵
so I use brown bananas and beer.

451
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,670
真美味
Delicious.

452
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,420
保罗在这里发现了一个全新的飞蛾物种
Paul here discovered a new species of moth.

453
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,940
加利福尼亚绿玉蛾
The California Jade Moth.

454
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,820
在我们的博物馆里就有展出
It's on display in our museum.

455
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,590
真是件了不起的大事
It's rather a big deal.

456
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,260
是啊  现在世界上的芸芸昆虫又多了一种
Yeah. Now there are 1,500,001 types of insects in the world.

457
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,210
这谦虚可真假
Well, that's false modesty.

458
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,480
我想是的  这的确是件大事
I guess so. It is a big deal.

459
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,610
对研究蛾的人来说
To moth people.

460
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,370
是对我们大家来说
To all of us.

461
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,620
恭喜你获得新发现
Congratulations on your new addition.

462
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
-谢谢  -令人印象深刻
- Thank you. - It's most impressive.

463
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,520
谢谢
Thank you.

464
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,260
让我猜猜  你是在研究秃鹰
Uh, let me guess. You're studying buzzards,

465
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,290
而你还设好了陷阱
and you're laying a trap for one right now.

466
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,400
说的跟真的一样
As if.

467
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,770
我研究的是"加州海狮的交配习惯"
Mating habits of the Zalophus Californianus.

468
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,970
海狮
Sea lions.

469
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,140
雄海狮靠打斗吸引一群雌海狮  像个坏小子
One badass male maintaining a stable of females through combat.

470
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,550
那很吸引你吗  有个能为你大打出手的男人
And that appeals to you? A man fighting for you?

471
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,660
谁不想找个霸道的男人
Who doesn't want an alpha male?

472
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,590
一个会为他的东西大打出手的男人
A guy who will fight for what's his?

473
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,590
超级火辣
Yeah. Super hot.

474
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,410
听起来不错
Sounds exciting.

475
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,730
很酷的  当保罗在追逐蛾子
It's so cool. While Paul chases moths

476
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,410
而珍妮特和她的蜥蜴混在一起的时候
and Jeanette messes around with her lizards,

477
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,170
我正在海岛间穿梭观察海豹
I head out for the islands to watch the seals play.

478
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,350
我不光只有脑子  瞧见没
I'm not just a brain, see?

479
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,170
我还喜欢玩
I like to play, too.

480
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,720
我是全方位的
I'm the total package.

481
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,200
坏小子  热辣  全方位
"Badass," "Super hot," "Total package."

482
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,080
全中
Bingo!

483
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,630
全中
Bingo!

484
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,410
是你伪造了约会资料
You wrote the fake dating profile

485
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,470
导致了琳达和她男友分手
that made Linda and her boyfriend break up.

486
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,140
这也没犯法啊  对吧
No law against it, is there?

487
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,230
也许她发现了是你干的
Maybe she found out it was you,

488
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,570
在实验室里找你对质  接着事情就失控了
confronted you in the lab, and things got out of hand.

489
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,620
听着  我没杀琳达
Look--hello! I didn't kill Linda.

490
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,660
那你为什么要拆散他们
So why did you want to break them up?

491
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,450
你是不知道项目组里的情况
You don't even know what it's like in the program.

492
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,070
基德博士希望我们像欢乐的一家人一样
Dr. Kidd likes us to play like we're one happy family.

493
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,920
但我们就像一群鬣狗一样  撕咬着对方
We're like a pack of hyenas tearing each other apart.

494
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,900
为什么
Why?

495
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,950
为了钱  还能为什么
Money. Why else?

496
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,810
博物馆里的东西可不是免费得来的
Look, the museum doesn't get all that stuff for free.

497
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,290
它需要各种发现  宣传和捐助
It needs discoveries, publicity, donations.

498
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,080
基德博士希望我们的项目小组是最棒的
Dr. Kidd wants our program to be the best.

499
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,000
所以如果你没有成果的话  再见了
So if you aren't producing, so long.

500
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,140
这话是什么意思
What does that mean?

501
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,110
你有没有听说过适者生存
You ever heard of survival of the fittest?

502
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,730
基德博士肯定听说过
'cause Dr. Kidd sure has.

503
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,260
她会淘汰到那些没有贡献
She likes to weed out the ones who can't contribute,

504
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,690
不能胜任的人
who can't hack it.

505
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,990
但没人能胜任  根本没有
But nobody hacks it. Not really.

506
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,980
什么意思
What do you mean?

507
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,640
珍妮特  那个蜥蜴女
Jeanette? Lizard girl?

508
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,070
你以为她能留下来  她都要急哭了
She has a special place on the back stairs? She goes to cry.

509
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,890
格雷格去年出了大纰漏
Greg had a major breakdown last year,

510
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,200
比如把老鼠骷髅扔到了窗户外
like throwing rat skulls out the window.

511
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,290
保罗呢  在他发现那该死的蛾子之前
And Paul? He was convinced Dr. Kidd was gonna fire him

512
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,150
他一度确信基德博士就要开除他了
until he discovered that dumb moth.

513
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,370
琳达呢  她是怎么应对的
How about Linda? How did she handle it?

514
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,160
她就像个机器
She was a machine.

515
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,820
我们都快疯了  她却什么事都没有
You're losing your mind, and there she is,

516
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,430
一样辛苦工作  却毫不费劲
working just as hard, not even breaking a sweat.

517
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,160
而我呢  因为没拿到
My mom wanted to kill me

518
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,150
院长的奖学金  我妈差点要杀了我
for not getting the dean's fellowship.

519
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,360
接着琳达遇到了她那个性感的警察男友
And then Linda lands that hot cop boyfriend?

520
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,590
就凭她
Her?

521
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,960
我是说
I mean...

522
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,340
看看
Right?

523
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,850
所以你伪造了约会资料想让他们分手
So you made up the fake dating profile to break them up.

524
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,320
我只是想看看  我能不能伤到她
I just wanted to see if I could hurt her.

525
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,330
或者她能不能被伤害到
If she could even be hurt.

526
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,470
她知道是你干的吗
Did she know it was you?

527
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,210
这件事毁了她
It wrecked her.

528
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,220
第二天  她做了一些很愚蠢的事情
The next day she messed up something stupid,

529
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,520
基德博士还朝她大吼来着
and Dr. Kidd yelled at her.

530
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,940
你知道吗
You know what?

531
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,860
这让我感觉真的很好
It felt really, really good.

532
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,660
我知道  这让我听上去像个坏人
And I know that doesn't make me sound like a nice person.

533
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,420
对  还真不是好人
No. No, it doesn't.

534
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,030
有点像"蝇王"的桥段啊
It's like "Lord of the Flies" over there.

535
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,030
{\an8}英国作家威廉·戈尔丁的代表作  借小孩的天真来探讨人性的恶

536
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,620
我不知道原来科学世界是如此的残酷
I didn't know the world of science was so cutthroat.

537
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,890
人们不是常说  因为风险极小
Well, like the man said, academic politics

538
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,940
学术政治也会充满恶意
can be vicious, because the stakes are small.

539
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,390
事实上风险非常小
Very small, indeed.

540
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,330
明天早上我们回博物馆一趟
Tomorrow morning we need to go back to the museum.

541
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,070
为什么
Why?

542
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,420
去教育
Education.

543
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,200
但现在我得做些事情
But now I have to do something.

544
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,200
检察长很清楚  控告不会坚持到最后
And the A.G. knows damn well the indictment won't stick.

545
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,440
我现在没空和你谈
Uh, I don't have time for this.

546
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,920
天下没有免费的午餐  这道理他懂
Nobody rides for free. I mean, he knows that.

547
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,390
怎么  你过来找我打扑克吗
What--what, you came here to play games?

548
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
我听说你输得挺惨
I heard you've been losing,

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,020
还影响到了你的工作
and, uh, it's been affecting your work.

550
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,810
我再打给你
Uh, I'll call you back.

551
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,410
扑克根本没影响我的工作
Look, the cards haven't been falling my way.

552
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,010
得了吧
Oh, come on.

553
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,690
你相信运气吗
You believe in luck?

554
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,010
不
No.

555
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
里斯本说你很厉害
Lisbon says you're pretty good.

556
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,540
玛格丽特  取消六点的安排
Margaret, cancel my 6:00.

557
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,840
两对
Two pair.

558
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,980
四条[四张同点]
Four of a kind.

559
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,850
瞧见没
See?

560
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,280
我知道怎么玩扑克
I know how to play poker.

561
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,350
你当然知道
Of course you do.

562
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,440
你擅长玩弄人  而不是牌
You play the man, not the cards.

563
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,300
对吧  我懂机率  我了解我自己
Right? I know the odds, I know myself.

564
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,610
你了解人性  知道如何操纵他们
You know people, you know how to control them.

565
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,210
却不善利用
Not that you always care.

566
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,940
什么意思
Uh... what's that mean?

567
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,430
要多抓苍蝇  蜂蜜比醋有效
Well, you win more flies with honey than with vinegar,

568
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,610
但你却非用醋
but you use vinegar anyway.

569
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,920
你是为里斯本来的吧
Is this about Lisbon?

570
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,890
你很喜欢虚张声势  是吧
You're very fond of the fake tell, aren't you?

571
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,430
你押注前  会四处张望  缓慢呼气
Before you bet, you look away and you breathe out very slowly,

572
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,820
看似想让自己平静下来
like you're trying to... calm yourself.

573
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,340
没错
Yes.

574
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,050
其实你有破绽
Well, you have a tell inside the fake tell.

575
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,450
当你这么做的时候
When you're bluffing,

576
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,780
别人能听见你的呼吸声
the breathing is audible.

577
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,410
说什么呢  我能控制住自己
The hell it is. I-I control myself.

578
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,820
你拿到好牌以后  就像那样呼吸
You get yourself a good hand and puff away like that,

579
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,660
曼彻斯特一定以为你在虚张声势
Manchester will for sure think you're bluffing.

580
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,130
相信我
Trust me.

581
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,740
简先生  有什么可以效劳
Mr. Jane. Can I help you?

582
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,280
但愿吧  你还想学我的记忆诀窍吗
I hope so. Uh, you still want to learn my memory trick?

583
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,050
当然
I would.

584
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,650
好  你要给琳达的同学们
Yeah, you teach a master class

585
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,300
上研修课的  是吧
with all of Linda's fellow classmates, huh?

586
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,210
今天下午的课  是我和保罗来上
Paul and I will be teaching it this afternoon.

587
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,400
这样啊
Yeah.

588
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,020
那我给你和你的学生
Well, how about I put on a memory seminar

589
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,470
来场记忆讲座如何
for you and your class?

590
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,560
再好不过了
That would be terrific.

591
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,090
不过你不是有谋杀案要破吗
But don't you have a murder to solve?

592
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,460
来得及
Eh, all in good time.

593
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,710
我需要几张桌子
Uh, I'm gonna need some tables,

594
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,200
大概三到四张排在那后面
possibly three or four across the back there.

595
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,190
好的
Okay.

596
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,180
还有  琳达的办公室里有很多动物标本
And, uh, Linda's office, it's full of animals-- dead ones.

597
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,150
是的
It is.

598
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,840
那些也要  做道具用
We'll need access to that, uh, for props.

599
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,090
好的  我猜
Okay. I assume...

600
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,430
你这么做一定另有意图吧
that you have some ulterior motive for all of this.

601
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,610
你们有怀疑对象了吗
Do you have a suspect?

602
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,200
有件事我要向你求证一下
There's one thing I'd like you to confirm for me.

603
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,620
什么事
What is that?

604
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,430
北扑翅鴷以什么为食
Just what is the diet of the northern flicker woodpecker?

605
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,140
好的  当然
Yeah. Sure.

606
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,500
你怎么会喜欢三角龙
How can you like Triceratops

607
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,150
而不是霸王龙
more than... T-rex?

608
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,480
霸王龙都是废物
T-rex are losers.

609
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,350
小胳膊小腿的  不过是长了牙的大型鸡
Little arms. It's a big chicken with teeth.

610
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,100
是吗  那三角龙根本就是长了角的猪
Yeah, and Triceratops is basically a pig with horns.

611
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,410
可它头上长着盾牌呢
And a shield on its head.

612
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,860
分分钟秒杀你那巨型鸡
Beats a giant chicken any day of the week.

613
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,290
做梦去吧  简有什么事
Ha ha, in your dreams. What did Jane want?

614
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,610
他叫我们回博物馆去
He wants us back at the museum.

615
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,810
回去干嘛
What are we gonna do?

616
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,270
-抢劫博物馆  -为什么
- Museum heist. - Why?

617
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,720
我早就不问这些问题了  走吧
I stopped asking questions a long time ago. Come on.

618
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,830
这是干嘛
What's this all about?

619
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,550
我们只是不想有任何遗漏  先生
We just need to cover our bases, sir.

620
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,220
这跟调查有什么关系
What does this have to do with the investigation?

621
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,870
我不能透露在办案件的细节
I can't discuss ongoing details of an investigation.

622
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,000
我得看看这些蜘蛛
I'm gonna need to look at one of these, uh, spiders.

623
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,430
狼蛛吗
The tarantulas?

624
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,670
孩子们  来看这些蜘蛛啊
Hey, kids, come check this out. Spiders.

625
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,070
对了  叫狼蛛
Oh, yes. The tarantulas.

626
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,680
我看没必要吧
I don't see why it is necessary.

627
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,850
别担心  先生  警方只是例行公事
Don't worry, sir. This is, uh, official police business.

628
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,070
你们一定想看看...
I'm sure you want to take...

629
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,720
等等  你要干嘛
Wait! What are you doing?

630
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,790
-我得近距离观察一下这只蜘蛛  -不行
- I'm gonna need to take a close look at this spider here. - No.

631
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,300
就是这只蜘蛛
This one specifically here, this spider.

632
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,330
不行  不行  你要干嘛
No, no, what are you doing?

633
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,270
来吧
Here we go.

634
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,080
不行  求你了
Just-- no. Oh, oh, please.

635
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,140
多加小心
Be very careful.

636
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,640
来吧  太好了
There we go. Uh, yeah.

637
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,150
我看没这个必要吧
I-I don't see why this is necessary.

638
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,660
别害怕  孩子们
Don't worry, children, it's...

639
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,180
好了  来吧
Uh, yeah... there we go.

640
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,230
等等  你在干嘛
Wait, what are you doing?

641
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,280
好了  我们得...
Yeah, we're gonna have to, uh...

642
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,020
-采集它的指纹  -什么
- dust this for prints. - Do what?

643
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,120
颜色真漂亮  是吧  孩子们
Oh, pretty colors. Huh, kids?

644
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
我被咬了
It bit--it bit me.

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,910
慢着  你说什么
Oh, wait. What?

646
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,380
我被它咬了
It bit me.

647
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,900
我去叫人来吧
Let me call somebody,

648
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
这个很危险
this can be a danger.

649
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,570
看  看见没有  我死定了
Look. See? It's deadly.

650
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,030
我感觉怪怪的
It feels a little strange.

651
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,120
-什么都看不出来  -我头晕了
- I don't see anything. - Oh, I'm feeling woozy.

652
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,750
没有  我开玩笑的  我没事
No, I'm just kidding. I'm fine.

653
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,920
别玩蜘蛛  孩子们  懂了吗
Don't play with spiders, kids. Okay?

654
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,890
我们今天有福了
We've got a real treat today.

655
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,310
可以称之为"现实版进化论"
You could call it "Evolution in Action."

656
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,600
派翠克·简先生将给我们做一场
Mr. Patrick Jane is coming to give us a seminar

657
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,440
有关记忆力上限的讲座
on the upper limits of memory.

658
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,200
-我们到教室了吧  -是的  到了
- Are we in the classroom? - Yes, we are.

659
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
太棒了
Great.

660
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,690
人类的记忆能力通常比人们意识到的要强
The human memory is far more capable than most people realize.

661
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,540
我之前进过这个房间
I've been in this room once before.

662
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,330
我当时来的时候
But when I was in here...

663
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,590
观察了一下
I paid attention.

664
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,880
观察得非常仔细
Very close attention.

665
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,320
谢谢  不过这只是记忆力方面的小儿科
Oh, thank you. Please. But that's just memory 101.

666
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,220
让我们转入高级课程吧
Let's move forward into the advanced coursework.

667
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,270
要想记忆力发挥作用
For memory to be useful,

668
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,290
就必须使其如照相机一般精准和迅速
it has to be as accurate and as fast as a camera.

669
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,930
你拿了多少动物  里斯本
How many animals did you get, Lisbon?

670
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,670
大概三十个
Around 30.

671
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,250
是从琳达的办公室里拿的吧
And you got them from Linda's office?

672
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,070
是  没错
Yes, I did.

673
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,550
所有的动物都来自琳达的办公室
All of the animals came from Linda's office.

674
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,590
之前我从没去过那儿
That's a place that I have never been.

675
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,980
一会儿  我会回过头
And in a moment, I will turn around

676
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,110
看我身后的东西  只需要几秒钟
and look behind me-- and just for a few seconds--

677
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,050
我就能按顺序记住桌上的所有动物
and I will memorize every animal on those tables in order.

678
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,080
然后我会教你们如何做到这一点
And then I will show you how you can do the same.

679
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,410
谁知道你是不是已经背下来了
How do we know you didn't already memorize them?

680
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,290
有个怀疑论者  我该想到的
Ah. A skeptic. I should have known.

681
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,280
不过你说得对
And you're right.

682
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
你们没道理要相信我
There's no reason for you to trust me.

683
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,400
保罗  你能不能把那些动物
Paul, would you mind rearranging the animals

684
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,490
按你认为合适的方式重新摆放
any way you see fit?

685
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,620
没问题
Sure.

686
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,650
谢谢
Thank you.

687
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,710
人类的大脑
The human brain.

688
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,830
只要运用得当  就能异常高效
Once you get it working right, it can be incredibly effective.

689
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,490
我们的大脑能作出很多不可思议的事情
The mind can do some miraculous things.

690
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,290
比如  预知未来
Uh, like... telling the future.

691
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,340
正如我现在所做的一样
Which is what I'm doing right now.

692
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
吹牛
Bull.

693
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,490
你要是这么说
For that...

694
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,440
就由你来拿着这个预言吧
You can be the one who holds the prediction.

695
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,660
科学就是预言  不是吗
Science is about prediction, isn't it?

696
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,550
是以确实的数据为基础的预言  不是算命
Predictions based on hard data, not fortunetelling.

697
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,940
表达不同而已
Ahh. Well, you say "Tomato,"

698
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,270
我认为科学家推崇理性思维
I say scientists believe in rational thought.

699
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,880
表格  列表  分类
And grids and lists and classification,

700
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,770
这些都没问题  可世界不是这么运转的
which is fine, but it's not how the world works,

701
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,430
当然大脑也并非如此运转的
and it's certainly not how the brain works.

702
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,590
你是说人是非理性的吗
You're saying people aren't rational?

703
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,210
保持理性只是一种手段
Well, being rational is a tool,

704
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,080
但并非我们掌握的唯一手段
but it's not the only tool we have.

705
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,780
早在我们把知识填进图表前
Long before we stuffed our knowledge into graphs and charts,

706
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,090
我们就用上了很多古老的方式  有时候
we used older and, in some cases,

707
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,170
是更为有趣的方式来记事
more entertaining ways to remember things.

708
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,330
怎么样了  保罗
How we doing there, Paul?

709
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,280
-好了  -太好了  请坐吧
- I think we're good. - Excellent. Please, take a seat.

710
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,770
现在  我要让你们见识一下我的理论
Now, I'd like to show you what I'm talking about.

711
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,660
里斯本  劳驾
Lisbon, uh, would you mind?

712
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,230
多谢
Thank you.

713
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,910
我们可以在大脑中建造一座宫殿来帮助记忆
We can create a memory by building a palace in our minds.

714
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,790
我们可以给自己唱首歌
We can sing ourselves a song,

715
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,340
或是讲个小故事
or tell ourselves a little story.

716
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,170
这是个恶霸的故事
A story of a bully--

717
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,040
一只灰色的狐狸
a gray fox--

718
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,900
和一个小个子勇士
and a little brave man--

719
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,040
一只老鼠
a rat--

720
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,290
他为他胖乎乎的兄弟癞蛤蟆
that stood up for his chubby little buddy the toad

721
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,160
和他的朋友蛋头出头
and his friend egghead.

722
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,130
接着是个穿燕尾服的男人的故事
The story of a man in a tuxedo

723
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,850
他在人群中钻来钻去
who snaked his way through a crowd

724
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,830
只为去见一位身着华服的女人
to meet a woman in a colorful dress.

725
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,760
企鹅  蟒蛇  三只松鼠  还有一只鹦鹉
Penguin, cobra, three squirrels, and a parrot.

726
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,550
接着是个关于飞行的故事
The story of flight...

727
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,150
猫头鹰  蝙蝠  飞蛾
An owl, a bat, a moth,

728
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
全部...
All...

729
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,170
看来我说错了
Ah, I sense I made a mistake.

730
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,830
没有飞蛾
No moth.

731
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,310
也许我的预言能解释我犯的错
Well, perhaps my prediction will explain my error.

732
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,650
珍妮特  请读出来  好吗
Uh, Jeanette, could you read it out, please?

733
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,410
飞蛾在保罗的口袋里
"The moth is in Paul's pocket"?

734
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,920
等等  什么
Wait, what?

735
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,130
那只飞蛾
The moth.

736
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,900
那只你重新摆放动物时
The moth you stole from the table

737
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,400
从桌上偷走的飞蛾
when you were rearranging the animals--

738
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,730
在你口袋里面
It's in your pocket.

739
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,510
我需要你清空你的口袋
I'm gonna need you to empty your pockets.

740
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,540
快点
Come on.

741
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,580
让我们看看
Let's have a look.

742
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,060
保罗  你拿这只飞蛾做什么
Paul, why did you take the moth?

743
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,570
那是只加利福尼亚绿玉蛾
That's a California Jade Moth.

744
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,590
-是的  -这物种是他发现的
- So it is. - The kind he discovered.

745
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,440
我以为唯一的一只收藏在博物馆里
I thought the only other one was in the museum.

746
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,790
-那这只是从哪儿来的  -等一下
- Where did that come from? - Wait a second.

747
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,640
你说过所有的动物
You said all the animals

748
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,810
都是从琳达办公室拿来的
came from Linda's office.

749
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,580
是从那儿拿的
They did.

750
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,480
保罗在琳达死后才发现了这种飞蛾
Linda died before Paul discovered the moth.

751
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,040
这飞蛾不可能是从她办公室拿的
This moth couldn't have come from her... office.

752
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,660
你会想明白的
You'll get there.

753
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,570
除非  是她先发现的这种飞蛾
Unless... she discovered the moth first.

754
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,690
保罗
Paul...

755
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,920
不会是你杀了琳达吧
You didn't kill Linda.

756
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,270
对  就是他
Yes, he did.

757
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,180
但是  我承认
But, uh, I confess--

758
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,620
那只飞蛾不是我从琳达办公室拿的
that moth didn't come from Linda's office.

759
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,580
我
I...

760
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,030
偷
s--

761
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,940
我从博物馆借出来的
Well, I-I borrowed it from the museum...

762
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,660
为了证明我的观点
to prove a point.

763
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,250
保罗
Paul.

764
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,070
之前我的论文被退稿了
I'd just had a paper rejected.

765
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,930
被同行评审打回了
Peer review threw it back at me.

766
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,600
基德博士非常失望
Dr. Kidd was so disappointed.

767
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,660
她从没说过什么
She never said anything.

768
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,890
她也不需要说
She never had to.

769
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,060
琳达的死跟这些事有什么关系
How did Linda come into it?

770
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,780
那天半夜在实验室里
It was late night at the lab.

771
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,660
她刚刚从森林里回来  非常兴奋
Uh, she came in fresh from the forest, excited.

772
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,320
她看到她的一只啄木鸟正在吃一只
Uh, she'd seen one of her woodpeckers eating a moth

773
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,430
她说不出种类的飞蛾
that she couldn't identify.

774
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,940
所以她放了些诱饵并抓住了一只
So she put down some bait and caught one.

775
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,810
我们在她的办公室找到了红糖
We found the brown sugar in her office.

776
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,300
就是她的诱饵吗
Was that her bait?

777
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,430
对
Yeah.

778
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,220
当我看到它的一瞬间我就知道这它是什么
I knew what it was the moment I saw it.

779
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,120
一个新物种
A new species.

780
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,240
它将带来新文章
I mean, that's articles,

781
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,400
博物馆展览
that's museum exhibits,

782
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,830
为项目带来资金
that's money for the program.

783
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,230
我看到未来由我自己命名这种飞蛾
I saw myself naming the moth.

784
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,100
我一直都想要给什么东西命名
I'd--I'd always wanted to name something.

785
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,830
我的工作岌岌可危
My job was on the line.

786
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,950
还有我的未来
My future.

787
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,840
我需要这只飞蛾
I needed it...

788
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,620
来度过难关
to survive.

789
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,270
我完全失去了理智
I just lost myself completely.

790
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,910
当我回过神以后
I came back to my senses,

791
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,160
把现场收拾干净
I cleaned up,

792
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,210
在我们实验室有很多种清理血迹的方法
lots of ways to clean blood in our lab.

793
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,200
然后  我让蠕虫来处理琳达
And then, I gave Linda to the worms.

794
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,280
之后我去了琳达之前
Then I went out to the part of the forest

795
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,360
发现飞蛾的
where I knew she'd been

796
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,470
那片树林
discovered the moth.

797
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,560
然后回来将这一切据为己有
I came back and got my accolades.

798
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,060
我保住了我的工作
I saved my job.

799
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,780
得到了一切我渴望的东西
I got everything I wanted.

800
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,810
基德博士
Dr. Kidd.

801
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,610
请叫我索尼亚
Sonia, please.

802
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
我想要感谢你抓住了保罗
I wanted to thank you for catching Paul.

803
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,550
你不必客气
Ah. There's no thanks necessary.

804
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,150
琳达死了  保罗进了监狱
Linda's dead, Paul's in jail,

805
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,160
梅根将被开除
and Megan is being expelled.

806
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,030
我想这个项目永远不会恢复了
I don't think the program will ever recover.

807
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,170
项目并不是真实存在的
The program isn't real.

808
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,060
问题是  你能从中恢复吗
The question is, will you recover?

809
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,150
我觉得非常无力
I felt so powerless.

810
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,040
我是说  面对死亡你又能做什么呢
I mean, what can you do in the face of death?

811
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,380
但是你并不软弱无力
You're not powerless, though.

812
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,930
你会行动
You act.

813
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,900
至少你可以做这件事
Well, there's one thing you can do.

814
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,780
保罗通过命名那种飞蛾获得了很多的荣誉
Uh... Paul took a lot of pride in naming that moth, when...

815
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,740
但实际上应该是琳达来命名它
When it should have been Linda who named it.

816
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,590
没错
Yes.

817
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,390
我会确保飞蛾将重新以她来命名
I'll make sure to rename it after her.

818
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,670
谢谢你
Thank you.

819
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,430
是我的荣幸
Pleasure.

820
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,500
对
Yeah.

821
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,620
讲得通
Makes sense.

822
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,630
好男人都有主了
All the good ones are taken.

823
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,640
得了吧
Please.

824
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,590
我想是物竞天择
Natural selection, I suppose.

825
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,680
行啦
Come on.

826
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,320
再见  派翠克
Good-bye, Patrick.

827
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
再见  索尼亚
Good-bye, Sonia.

828
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,000
跟道金斯五百美元
$500 to Dawkins.

829
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,450
不跟
Nope.

830
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,500
我要
I'll, uh...

831
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,650
加注一百美元
raise $100.

832
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,070
看来我不得不再加注一百美元
Well, I'm just gonna have to raise you another $100.

833
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,370
你怎么就学不会呢  盖尔
When are you gonna learn, Gale?

834
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,780
再加注一千美元
Raise $1,000.

835
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,090
全押上
All in.

同花更大
Flush takes the pot.

839
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,490
"晚安  月亮"
"Goodnight moon."

840
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,490
{\an8}以下皆源自美国儿童读物《晚安  月亮》

841

你看到没  你刚才看到没
You see that? Did you see that?

844
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,330
同花吗  非常带劲
The flush? It was very nice.

845
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,700
我把他赢光了
Ah, I gutted him!

846
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,370
我也这么想
I would say so, yeah.

847
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,650
你很聪明  让简来给我上课
That was very slick, you having Jane give me lessons.

848
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,160
看来你真得很想帮范佩尔
You must really want to help Van Pelt.

849
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,340
简到底做了什么
What did Jane do?

850
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,530
现在就不要再装了
Oh, now there's no need to be coy.

851
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,160
我会给你回报的
I don't have a problem with a little quid pro quo.

852
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,310
白帽黑客项目  对吗
The white hat program, wasn't it?

853
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,800
明早我就会批准津贴

-你知道这意味着什么吗  -是的

861
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,450
这意味着它们是食物链的最顶端
That means they're top of the food chain.

862
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,970
-它们能吃掉任何动物  -所以呢
- They eat everything. - So?

863
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,320
所以霸王龙比三角龙更强  我赢了
So... T. Rex beats Triceratops. I win.

864
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,460
你昨晚回家百度了恐龙

对  为了那个什么白帽项目的事
Oh. Yeah, for that white hat thing.

870
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,560
不是说没有津贴吗
I thought there's no money for that.

871
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,280
里斯本解决了
Lisbon fixed it.

872
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,760
要是能说声再见就好了
Would have been nice to say good-bye.

873

Yeah, well, cowards don't get to say good-bye

874

Yep.

878
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,230
此话怎讲
How so?

879
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,720
你假装没有爱着范佩尔
How long have you been pretending

880
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,850
装了多长时间了
you're not in love with Van Pelt?

881
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,220
谁说我爱着范佩尔了
Who says I'm in love with Van Pelt?

882

I was once, a long time ago, but not anymore.

我们只是  只不过是  好朋友
We're just... we're just... good friends.

你是个胆小鬼和糟糕的骗子
You're a coward and terrible liar.

885
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,780
你胡扯

886
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,190
胆小鬼  他懂什么是恋爱吗
"Coward." What does he know about relationships?

887
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,190
你就跟怀孕的妓女约会
Yeah, well, you date pregnant hookers

888

而且你的恐龙是吃草的

890
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,040
这段时间我们人手会不够
We're gonna be short-staffed for a while.

891

说到这

895
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,440
我破坏了扑克游戏的生态系统
I've upset the ecosystem of the poker game.

896

我想你在博物馆呆了太久了
I think you've been spending too much time at the museum.

897
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,430
"破坏了生态系统"

Money talks.

903
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,820
我们用什么来做筹码
What do we use for stakes?

904
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,440
没有筹码怎么打扑克
You can't play poker without stakes.

905
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,560
我已经搞定了

906
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,430
食草动物算一  食肉动物算五
Herbivores are worth 1, carnivores are worth 5.
