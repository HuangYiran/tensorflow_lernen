1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,280
法律面前并非人人平等
There is no equality before the law.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,880
{\an8}前情提要

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,320
那是我的第一条真理
That is my first truth.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,640
离我姐妹远点
Stay away from my sister.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,040
正因为她在 你在码头才没被打倒
It's only cos of her you're not face-down in the harbour.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,080
为什么这么敌对
Why all the hostility?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,538
刚才外面的那个男人...
The man you were with outside...

8
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,280
别再和他说话了
You must not talk to him.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,160
- 我不喜欢这里 - 你别无选择
- I don't like it here. - You don't have an alternative.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
那个男人让你处境危险
You're in danger from that man.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,160
我选择了你
I have chosen you.

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,480
我想要人们知道我为何如此行事
I want people to know why I'm doing this.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,000
是他 又开始行动了
It's him, it's started.

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,040
老人有什么用
What good are old people?

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,080
他们不事生产
They do not produce,

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,960
所以我们让他们孤独死去
so we leave them to die alone.

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
死亡人数为十四人
The confirmed death toll is 14,

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
但警方预示人数可能还会上升
but police are warning that this may rise.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,920
现在联合犯罪局局长助理吉瑞・布莱恩特
I'm now joined by Assistant Chief Constable Gerry Bryant

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,520
就在我身旁
from the Unified Crime Directorate.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
局长助理先生
Assistant Chief Constable,

22
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,800
如果这起案件的凶手
if this is the work of the killer

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
与在欧洲隧道杀死两名受害者的是同一个人
who left two victims in the Eurotunnel,

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
那我们就该考虑这案件的严重性了
then we are looking at a serious escalation.

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,090
是的 目前为止
Yes, although as yet,

26
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,360
我们还没有确定它们是否有关联
we have no confirmation to that effect.

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
但我向市民们保证 我们已经计划...
But I can assure the public that we've drafted in...

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,240
所有的受害者都服用了同一种吗啡类止痛药
All the victims have the same morphine-based painkillers.

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
那司机呢
What about the driver?

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,400
没有 吹嘘罢了 他是清白的
No, usual blurb. He's clean.

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,489
所以如果那些药物被污染了 就是在别处作案
So, if the drugs were contaminated, it was done elsewhere

32
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:14,720
然后它们被放在面包车里
and they were placed on the van.

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,840
- 我来探望我姐妹 - 我跟你说了
- I've come to see my sister. - I've told you already,

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
一次只能有一位访客
just one visitor at a time.

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,920
他来了
Here he is.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
正人君子来了
Voucher Man.

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,720
抱歉 伙计
Sorry, pal.

38
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,920
你错过了人工呼吸和胸部按摩
You missed the mouth-to-mouth and chest massages.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
你能让这男的出去吗
Will you have this man removed from this room?

40
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,120
- 他很可能是凶手 - 是 我是凶手
- He probably caused this. - Yeah, course I did.

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
她打给谁了
Who did she phone?

42
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
谁在她需要的时候帮她了 是我救的她
Who did what was needed? I saved her.

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,240
你却没做到
You couldn't do that.

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,520
什么都做不了
You can't do anything.

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,440
你会为我能做的事而惊讶
You'll be surprised what I can do.

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,040
保安 306病房
Security, room 306.

47
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,880
斯蒂芬 你...
Stephen, just...

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,360
走吧
Just go.

49
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,840
走吧... 等... 再回来
Just...go and come back when...

50
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,680
斯蒂芬... 斯蒂芬...
Stephen... Stephen...

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,080
斯蒂芬
Stephen!

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,080
四号房
Number four.

53
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,440
到了 哈瑞特・斯通 一样的药 却没症状
There we go. Harriet Stone. Same drugs, no symptoms.

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,160
一整批都有毒怎么她还能没事
How did she remain immune if it was a poison batch?

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
她没聋
She's not deaf.

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,120
为何不进来问她呢
Why don't you come in and talk to her?

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,920
- 书好看吗... 哈瑞特 - 有点悲伤
- So, is it a good book...Harriet? - Hmm, a little sad.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,880
- 是吗 - 是 不过没事 我喜欢悲伤的
- Is it? - Yes, but that's all right, I like sad.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,480
- 是啊 悲伤也挺好的 不是吗 - 是
- Yeah, sad's all right, isn't it? - Yeah.

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,280
- 对书来说 还有音乐 - 是
- In books anyway. And tunes. - Hmm, yes.

61
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,720
还有什么
So, what else?

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
关于苏珊娜还有什么想说的
What else can you tell us about Susanna?

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,360
- 她不开心 - 不开心吗
- She's not happy. - No?

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,800
- 为什么 - 我也不知道原因 直觉而已
- Why not? - I don't know why, I just know.

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,760
她帮你拿药
She gives you your medication?

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,920
药挺好的 是啊
For all the good it does. Yes.

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,880
- 你是法国人 - 是的
- Are you French? - Yes.

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,080
我很想再去一次法国
I'd love to go to France again.

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,760
但不可能了
But I never will.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,111
是的 可能旅游对现在的你来说
No, the journey would probably be

71
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:17,760
太困难了
too difficult for you now.

72
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
喂
Yep.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
苏珊娜・博蒙特在医院
Susanna Beaumont's in hospital.

74
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,940
可怜的苏
Oh, poor Suze.

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
她朗读的声音很好听
She has a lovely reading voice, you know?

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,800
我不知道你想说什么
I don't understand your point.

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
她自己说
She said herself

78
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,480
她没希望再去法国了
it was unlikely she would see France again.

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
- 所以你赞同了 - 是
- And you agreed? - Yes.

80
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,360
但是也许她不想...
But maybe she didn't want...

81
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,720
不好意思 你是觉得她还能再去法国吗
I'm sorry, do you think she will see France again?

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
不是 但那不是重点
No, but that's not the point.

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,983
你为何不直接说
Why didn't you just say,

84
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:48,560
"你都快进棺材了 奶奶"
"You'll be in the graveyard soon, Grandma."

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
因为我没这样想
Because it's not what I was thinking.

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
有时你只用说好话 警察
Sometimes you just need to say the right thing. Police.

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
不要说永远 类似这样的
Never say never, that kind of thing.

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,720
那应该会说出很白痴的话
That would have been a really dumb thing to say.

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,842
好吧 苏珊娜・博蒙特
Okay. Susanna Beaumont.

90
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:03,200
给她打了镇定剂 还是很难受
She's sedated, still in a lot of pain.

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,386
还有 今天早上他兄弟来了
And there was a bit of a scene this morning

92
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:06,520
发生了点小插曲
with her brother.

93
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
什么小插曲
What kind of scene?

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,240
她兄弟很难对付 让她很不安
An ugly one which left her very disturbed.

95
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,480
他走之前还打了护士
He struck a nurse before leaving.

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
他叫什么
What's his name?

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,897
他叫斯蒂芬・博蒙特
Eh, it was Stephen Beaumont,

98
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:17,720
法定近亲
he's the official next of kin.

99
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,338
是他送她来的
Did he bring her in?

100
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,560
不 她自己坐救护车来的
No, she was on her own in the ambulance.

101
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
- 她现在在哪儿 - 在旁边的房间
- Where is she now? - Er, in a side room.

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,640
所以她跟那些老人一样都吃了同一种药
So, she ate the same poison as the old people?

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,280
是的 但因为她更年轻强壮
Yeah, but she's younger and fitter,

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,800
所以情况比较乐观
so her body's better able to deal with it.

105
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,920
这不能解释它是怎么到这儿来的 不是吗
It doesn't explain how it got there, does it?

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,980
她刚稳定下来 别跟她说话
She's through there.Don't try and talk to her.

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
你觉得是她干的吗
Do you think she did it?

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,434
先毒死十四名老人
Poisoned 14 old people

109
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,240
然后假装用一样的方式自杀
and then tried to kill herself the same way?

110
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,400
不是
No.

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,440
事实上是用鸦片类止痛
Given the fact that it was an opiate-based pain relief,

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,420
我认为她偷了哈瑞特・斯通的药
I think she was stealing Harriet Stone's medication.

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
安全地回到了吗啡姐的怀抱
Safely back in the arms of Sister Morphine.

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,302
"亲爱的斯蒂芬 学校..."
"Dear Stephen, how is..."

115
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,040
"亲爱的斯蒂芬"
"Dear Stephen."

116
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,280
"学校怎么样"
"How is school?"

117
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,840
"妈妈说你讨厌上学 她走的时候你还哭了"
"Mummy says you hate it and cried when she left you."

118
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,440
"记住 你是我的至爱"
"Remember, I love you more than anybody.

119
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,440
"姐妹 苏"
"Your sister, Suze."

120
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,720
- 她没寄出去 - 是的
- She never sent it? - No.

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,020
好吧 我们先去看看她的公寓
Okay, let's take a look at her flat.

122
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,720
查克斯 帮我查查斯蒂芬・博蒙特行吗
Chuks, run a check on Mr Stephen Beaumont, would you?

123
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,240
# 到我怀里来 #
Venez dans mes bras 

124
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,640
# 靠近我 亲爱的 #
Closer to me, dear

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,120
# 让我自己 #
Donnez-vous moi 

126
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
# 抛开所有恐惧 #
Set aside all fear 

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,680
# 一根红线 缠绕永远 #
Restons enlaces pour l'ternit

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,720
# 是的 你是我的 #
Yes, you shall be mine 

129
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,159
# 直到地老天荒 #
Till the end of time 

130
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,563
隧道谜案 第一季第三集

131
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,600
我不知道斯蒂芬要对我们做些什么
I don't know what Stephen's going to do with us?

132
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
他把我们带到这个脏房子还有...
He brought us to this dirty cottage and...

133
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,400
帮帮我 求你了
You have to help me, please.

134
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,800
我想离开这里 想去伦敦
I want to leave, I want to go to London.

135
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,920
我需要钱...快点
I need money...quickly.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
你在哪儿 哪个区域
Where are you? What part?

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,840
我不知道 有个电话亭 红色的
I don't know. Phone box, it's red.

138
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
还有两匹马在牧场上
There is a field with two horses.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,480
房子什么颜色
And what colour are the horses?

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,760
有一栋是棕色的...
Um, there is one brown...

141
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,676
另一栋是黑的 带白色斑点
and the other one is black with white spots.

142
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
我开玩笑呢 亲爱的 你在哪条街
I'm joking, babe. What street are you on?

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,500
我... 我看不到任何标志 什么都没有
I... I can't see any signs, there's nothing.

144
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,440
无名街... 旁边有匹马
Where the streets have no name... near a horse.

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,040
因为这样我才不常去乡下旅游
That's why I don't normally travel the countryside.

146
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
我想起来了 有个酒吧
I see, there is a pub.

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,480
我们经过一条路
We passed on the road.

148
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,520
叫狐狸和什么的
Um, the Fox and something.

149
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,800
猎犬
Hounds?

150
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
弗金 黑尔
Firkin? Hare?

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,280
猎犬 还有那房子在路的同一边
Hounds, and the house is on the same side of the road,

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,320
有一点远
just a little bit further.

153
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,200
好
Okay.

154
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,840
我会用导航仪在荒郊中心兜一圈的
I'll search through the middle of nowhere on my GPS.

155
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,864
玩一下午的猎狗追狐
An afternoon of playing Fox and Hounds

156
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,240
把去伦敦的火车票给你
gets you a train ticket to London.

157
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,440
再给点零花钱去参观白金汉宫
Some extra pocket money to visit Buckingham Palace.

158
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,080
我不明白为什么...
I don't know why...

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,831
我从没干过这个 不知道怎么...
I've never done this before, I don't know how...

160
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,680
你会没事的 顺其自然就好
You'll be fine. Just go with the flow.

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,280
我来帮你介绍
I'll do the introductions.

162
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,600
你只要保证别让孩子在周围 好吗
You make sure the kid's not around now, yeah?

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,600
别让他看见我
Don't even let him see me.

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,420
她最后一通电话是打给安东尼・沃尔什的
Last number called from her mobile was to Anthony Walsh.

165
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,240
- 他是... - 吉玛・柯万的皮条客
- As in...? - Gemma Kirwan's pimp.

166
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,560
他可不只这一个营生
And not the only string to his bow.

167
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,880
听说他最近毒品卖得风生水起
He's stated slinging a lot of meth recently, I hear.

168
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
显然没卖给苏珊娜
Yeah, not to Susanna though.

169
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
我们认为她的药是偷来的 不是买的
We think she was stealing drugs, not buying them.

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,640
她兄弟那边有什么消息吗
Anything on the brother?

171
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,840
斯蒂芬・博蒙特 居无定所
Stephen Beaumont, no fixed abode.

172
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,720
在慈善机构帮助寻求庇护者
Works for some charity helping asylum seekers

173
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,360
和其他类似人员
and the like.

174
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,255
- "类似人员" - 别问 头儿
- "And the like?" - Don't start, boss,

175
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,804
我还没吃早餐呢
I haven't even had breakfast yet.

176
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,120
对了 他出国了
Anyway, he's out of the country.

177
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,954
- 去哪儿了 - 不清楚
- Where? - Don't know,

178
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,328
只听到他那可笑的手机彩铃
just heard the funny ringtone on his mobile.

179
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,640
也许在罗马尼亚
Probably in Romania,

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,760
寻找其他可以带回来提供帮助的人
rounding up a few more he can bring over to help.

181
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,320
给慈善机构打电话 问他什么时候回国
Phone the charity, find out when he's due back in the UK.

182
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,100
- 让他联系我们 - 好的
- Get him to give us a shout. - Cool.

183
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
我把事情记在脑子里
I put things in rooms.

184
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,840
很好
Fine.

185
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,120
就是个简单的记忆装置
It's just a simple memory device.

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
管用吗
How does that work?

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,960
我想象脑子里有一个房子
I have this imaginary house in my head.

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
里面有很多房间
With many rooms.

189
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,800
我把想要记住的事情分门别类放在各个房间里
I put things I want to remember into parts of the house

190
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,120
这样我就知道到哪里去找它们
so I know where to look for them.

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,640
睡不着的时候 我会走进去
Sometimes when I can't sleep, I walk through it,

192
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,040
看看每个房间
look into each room.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
它是什么样的
What does it look like, your house?

194
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,282
你必须自行想象你的房子
You have to make your own house,

195
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,000
否则不管用
otherwise it doesn't work.

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,360
是建立在一个真实房子的基础上吗
Is it based on a real house?

197
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,320
那里的警察什么样
So what were the cops like?

198
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,947
有个法国警察
There was a French detective,

199
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:47,600
她有点古怪 但你会喜欢的
she was a bit weird, but you would.

200
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
那个英国警察嘛 他...
And then the English one and he...

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
- 很不喜欢我 - 不是吧...
- He really didn't like me. - No...

202
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,720
对你的摇钱树
Oh! Little bit more respect

203
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,200
尊重点好吗 乔诺
for your golden goose, please, Johnno.

204
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,480
毕竟真杀选了我作联系对象
I mean, TT did choose me to communicate with.

205
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,078
- 真杀 - 对 "真理杀手"
- TT? - Yeah, "Truth Terrorist".

206
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,636
昨晚想出来的 不赖吧
Came up with it last night. Good, hey?

207
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,720
是啊 也许我们应该谨慎点
Yeah, we should perhaps be a little careful

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,040
别过度美化这个疯子
about glamorising the mad bastard.

209
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,060
对啊 这样能增加
Oh, yeah, that's a strategy

210
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,000
我们的线上点击率
that's going to boost our online hit-rate.

211
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
听着 我们得到了一个
Look, we've got an in

212
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,940
数年来最具爆炸性的新闻
with one of the biggest news phenomenons in years.

213
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,352
是啊
Yeah.

214
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,280
- 喂 - 丹尼
- Yeah? - Danny.

215
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,560
我的第二个真理才刚刚开始
My second truth has only just begun.

216
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,480
没人在乎做出牺牲
Nobody cares about people who made sacrifices,

217
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,640
辛苦工作 为国家效力的人
worked hard, or served their country.

218
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,920
一旦社会不再需要他们 
Once society no longer needs them, they're abandoned...

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,160
他们就会被无情抛弃 自生自灭
to slow and lonely death.

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,760
什么 所以你要帮他们个忙吗
What, so you're doing them a favour?

221
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,720
我是说 无意冒犯 伙计 但你怎么知道
I mean, no offence, mate, but how do you know

222
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,696
他们不喜欢坐在自己的尿上
they weren't happy sitting in their own piss

223
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,960
看便宜货大作战呢
and watching Bargain Hunt?

224
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,960
{\an8}便宜货大作战:英国电视节目

225
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,720
谁赋予你评断他人生命意义的权力呢
I mean, who appointed you judge of what their lives meant?

226
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,640
听着 你说你的第二条真理已经开始了
Look, you said that your second truth has begun?

227
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,640
很好 你不光能说会道
Good. You listen as well.

228
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
这不只是在英国才有的问题
This is not just a problem in Britain.

229
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,160
好的 所以呢
Okay, so?

230
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,908
不久我们就会知道
Soon we will see how much

231
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,620
法国的老英雄们有多受重视了
old heroes are cared for in France.

232
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
等等 别着急

233
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,960
你想玩球吗

234
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
我们玩你的小球吧

235
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,520
给你解开绳子 玩吧

236
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:12,094
我知道你花钱是要玩粗野点的
I know you paid for a bit of rough and tumble

237
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:15,134
但是... 别太过了 好吗
but...don't take it too far, yeah?

238
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:17,354
几个耳光就好
Couple of slaps.

239
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,454
特别说一下 别搞窒息
Bit of verbal, no air locking.

240
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:23,194
对蒂娜温柔点 好吗
And go easy on Tina, yeah?

241
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,514
你会玩得很爽的
It's got a kick to it.

242
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:27,414
来吧
Come on.

243
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:28,694
不
No.

244
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,774
不
No!

245
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:40,654
博蒙特先生 我是诺思伯恩警局的
Mr. Beaumont, this is DC Chuks Akinade

246
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,294
查克斯・阿金内德探员
of Northbourne Police.

247
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:45,174
你回国后能给我打个电话吗
Could you give me a call when you're back in the country?

248
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:48,174
百货公司的政策向来都是起诉
The policy of the department store is always to press charges.

249
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:49,774
然而 鉴于她的年龄
However, in the light of her age

250
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,694
和初犯的事实
and the fact that this is the first time...

251
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,534
那是个误会
It was a mistake.

252
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:56,294
试试 "我这样做是因为朋友的唆使"
Try, "I did it because my friends bullied me into it."

253
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,254
她没有朋友
She hasn't got any friends.

254
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:03,054
优秀的人总是与众不同的 甜心
The top was the wrong colour anyway, sweetheart.

255
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:04,134
想引人注意
You need something to draw attention

256
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,534
就用你这双可爱的大眼睛啊
to those lovely big eyes.

257
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:09,174
那是遗传我爸的
I get them from my dad.

258
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,894
好吧
All right.

259
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,654
别再让我在这里看到它们就好
Well, just don't let me see them round here any more.

260
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:34,714
告诉我惩罚是什么吧
So tell me what my punishment is?

261
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,954
除了不能和爸爸而是和你生活以外
Apart from having to live with you and not Dad.

262
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
我们知道他是谁吗

263
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,480
还不清楚 但是会有人认出来的

264
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,960
这个真理是关于老人的

265
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
凶手提到过法国老英雄

266
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
他这次最好没用我们的服务器

267
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,720
没用

268
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,040
他用的是洋葱路由器

269
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,040
{\an8}用户能随意发布文件而不会被追踪到发布路径

有图层加密技术

271
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,880
最近一次我们追踪到的地址是摩尔多瓦的某处

272
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
爱丽丝去哪儿了

看起来希望不大 但是有几处热源

287
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,040
我们先大范围搜索 然后对异常情况放大影像

288

我不懂英语

322
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,160
我只是来确认你们不会翻乱这里

323
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,720
- 顺便看看福煦 - 福煦

324
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
他的宠物狗

325
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:40,114
什么东西
What's est le chien?

326
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,800
你跟让・克劳德很熟吗

327
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
他不太合群 以前在军队待过

328
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,840
所以给狗起了这么个蠢名字

329
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,400
他给移民上基础法语课

330
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,000
他有社会良知吗

331
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,080
我不这样认为 没有

332
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,320
他认为移民应该更加融入这里

333
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,920
尽管对他们的文化不太感兴趣

334
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,760
他的房东很差劲 所以我才来帮他一些忙

335
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,640
我之前跟房东闹过矛盾

336
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,680
他想让克劳德离开

337
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,080
喂

338
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
好的 我们马上到

339
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,134
有人可能目击了绑架过程

法国共产主义者
Communist Party of France.

341
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,654
我敢打赌
I put my house on it.

342
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:25,494
因为他在救济站工作
Because he works in a soup kitchen.

343
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:27,894
是的 不仅如此 小时候我们去过人文节
Yeah, well, not just that. Spot them a mile off.

344
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:30,974
一公里之外就能看见他们
We used to go L'Humanit festivals when we were kids.

345
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,080
当时他在这里遛狗

346
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,560
遛狗时被绑架的

347
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,600
目击者称是一辆没见过的面包车

348
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,600
他被吓坏了 没法说清细节

349
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,600
他还以为是警察在工作 所以就离开了

350
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:49,334
好的
Okay.

351
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,760
鉴证科对泰瑟枪做了鉴定

352
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,520
- 然后呢 - 查不出型号

353
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,880
绑匪掩盖了痕迹

354
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:07,054
硬币而已
Finder's keepers.

355
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,214
我们唯一的目击者在这
Here's our only witness.

356
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,894
说说你看见了什么
Anyone speak his language?

357

你会说英语吗

让・克劳德遭到电击时 狗还套着狗绳
He was still on his leash when Jean-Claude got tasered.

359
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:18,534
- 是的 - 可能也就是五米的距离
- Yeah. - Probably within a 5-meter range.

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,080
你有梳子吗

361
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
没有

362
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,454
你们有梳子吗
Do either of you have a comb?

363
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:27,574
没有
No.

364
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,494
猜测很大胆
That's a long shot.

365
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:40,974
不是吧
No.

366
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,254
是碱火焰电离检测器标签
It's an AFID tag.

367
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,168
绑匪在下手之前
The dog must have run off

368
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:47,774
这条狗先逃跑了
before he had a chance to get him.

369
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:49,094
干得好
That's good.

370
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:51,251
太好了
That's very good.

371
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,414
绑匪疏忽了这点 太好了
He's made a mistake. That's very good.

372
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
你想干什么 为什么我会在这里

373
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,800
你究竟想干什么

374
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,600
你有什么目的

375
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,880
回答我

376
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
回答我

377
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,120
为什么把我带到这里

378
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,120
告诉我...

379
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
还是没消息

380
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,680
我们扩大了搜索范围

381
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
列出了一份空仓库的名单

382
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:02,254
美国已经发生三起信件炸弹事件
While inevitably people have drawn comparisons

383
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:03,454
三人遇害
with the Unabomber,

384
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:05,400
人们难免会联想到
whose letter bombs killed three people

385
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,334
智能炸弹
in the United States.

386
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:07,788
今天邀请到的是
I'm joined now by

387

好 继续 米利亚姆

为我们揭开真相吧
Give us the lowdown.

391
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,774
专家们的福音
Payday for the experts, eh?

392
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:25,214
女儿怎么不回自己房间睡
Why aren't the girls in their bed?

393
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:27,845
- 我把床在易趣网上卖了 - 干得好
- I sold them on eBay. - Good move.

394
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:29,534
她们睡我们的床
They're in our bed.

395
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:32,694
这得感谢你的大儿子
You can thank your eldest son.

396
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:34,334
为什么 他干什么了
Why, what's he'd done now?

397
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,934
他给妹妹们看了网上绑架的直播视频
He showed them that web bite with the kidnapped man,

398
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:39,914
她们现在显然是吓坏了
so obviously now they're too scared to sleep in their room.

399
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,774
- 你干什么 - 我干什么
- What's up with you? - What's up with me?

400
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,614
你在玩什么
What are you playing at?

401
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:02,014
干嘛给汉娜和玛雅看那个恐怖的视频
Showing Hannah and Maya all that scary stuff?

402
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:04,454
大家都在看 都在谈论啊
Everyone's watching it, everybody's talking about it.

403
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:08,494
- 这是真实的 - 大家起码都十岁了吧
- It's reality. - Everybody isn't under ten years old.

404
00:23:08,574 --> 00:23:10,374
我不是故意的
I didn't show it to them.

405
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,589
她们像平常一样来捣蛋
They just came in here bothering me as usual

406
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,754
不小心看到的
and then they saw it.

407
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,934
那你更应该注意一点
Well, you should be more careful.

408
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,974
学会你的教育方法还需要点时间
It might take me a while to learn your parenting skills.

409
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,534
你提到的那个记者 丹尼・希勒
That journalist you mentioned, Danny Hillier.

410
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:30,934
大家都在看他的博文
Everyone's reading his stuff.

411
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:32,094
很好
Great.

412
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:35,634
称他为真杀 真理杀手
Calls him TT. The "Truth Terrorist."

413
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,294
大家都在谈论真杀的行为
People are talking about what TT's doing.

414
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:42,414
关于正义 老人
The thing about justice, the old people.

415
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:45,054
你可以质疑
You can say what you like,

416
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,805
但起码比八卦名人的绯闻
but it's better than chatting about

417
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:48,534
强多了
all that celebrity shit.

418
00:23:49,654 --> 00:23:54,654
现在我宁愿汉娜和玛雅
Well, right now I'd rather that Hannah and Maya's reality

419
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:58,174
只是反应过激了
was a little more anthropomorphic fare.

420
00:23:58,254 --> 00:23:59,614
什么
What?

421
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:00,894
小女孩们
Peppa Pig.

422
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,534
保证她们远离你的电脑
Keep them away from your computer.

423
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:04,814
是爱丽丝・瓦塞尔曼吗
Is that Elise Wassermann?

424
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:06,254
我能打声招呼吗
Can I say bonjour?

425
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,508
查克斯
Chuks.

426
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,654
什么时候
When?

427
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:12,694
好的 我马上到
Right. I'll come now.

428
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:19,041
{\an8}- 你还在吗 - 在 刚才我爸又来烦我了

429
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
看这个

430
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,880
是他的枪吗

431
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,920
马丁・戴伯里克 他声称枪不见了

432
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,680
一年前的事 我记得

433
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
他是名糟糕的警察

434
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,440
这份陈述不够充分 但他似乎从未...

435
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
奥利弗吗

436
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
戴伯里克

437
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,600
你们要干嘛

438
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,960
不是...住手

439
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:13,014
你偷了哈瑞特・斯通的止痛药
You were stealing Harriett Stone's painkillers.

440
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,494
她还好吗
Is she all right?

441
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:16,214
很好
Yeah.

442
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:19,974
托你的福 让她痛苦不堪
Thanks to you leaving her in agony while you fed your habit.

443
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,976
我的生活一团糟
My life was such a mess.

444
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:27,901
我之前是个名人 你知道吗
I used to be somebody, you know?

445
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:32,721
我以前是电影明星的经纪人
I used to do PR for film stars.

446
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,814
大部分还都是大牌
Most of them are right cunts.

447
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:39,954
其余的也不错
Some of them are all right.

448
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,714
但是我不在乎 一味地...
I didn't care, just...

449
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:47,214
聚会 吸毒 去俱乐部
parties, drugs and clubs.

450
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,054
现在我还记得那种感觉
I remember the smell of it.

451
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:54,850
人家过去叫我性感苏
People used to call me Sexy Suze.

452
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,174
我跟明星在厕所乱搞
I fucked film stars in toilets.

453
00:25:58,254 --> 00:25:59,694
但好事不长久...
But like all good things...

454
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:01,574
别笑话我
Don't laugh at me.

455
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,665
我没有笑你
I'm not laughing at you.

456
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,336
后来是怎么结束的
So how'd you end up?

457
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:09,385
后来一切都开始走下坡路
Things just started to go wrong.

458
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:13,094
我兄弟在这里吗
Is my brother here yet?

459
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:14,814
不在
No.

460
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,974
你和斯蒂芬关系好吗
Are you close to Stephen?

461
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,171
他知道你在哪儿吗
Does he know where you were?

462
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,420
为什么这么问
Why?

463
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:26,520
好奇而已
Just curious.

464
00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:30,694
他想拯救世界
He wants to save the world.

465
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:32,654
是吗
Does he?

466
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:37,414
斯蒂芬跟我说过他的眼睛
Stephen told me about his eyes.

467
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,759
谁的
Whose eyes?

468
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,134
你知道现在斯蒂芬在哪里吗
Do you know where Stephen might be now?

469
00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:47,454
我不舒服
I was sick.

470
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:51,037
鱼的鲜血让我恶心
Sick-sick because of the blood on the fish.

471
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:56,174
他们在船底猛打鱼的脑袋
They were hitting their heads on the bottom of the boat.

472
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:57,954
行了
That's enough.

473
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,040
你遗失的泰瑟枪在一起绑架案件中被使用

474
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
所以呢

475
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,760
要是好人捡到他们会上交的

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,040
你根本没有把它放在车顶上

477
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,520
事实上 你根本没有遗失它

478
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
别搞笑了

479
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,680
我为什么要编这么蠢的话骗你

480
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,120
我因为这事被开除了

481
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,800
还有可卡因

482
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,400
一个罪犯跟踪警察

483
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,040
希望他蠢到会把泰瑟枪落在车顶

484
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
你觉得这可能吗

485
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,400
我已经付出过代价了

486
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,400
随你怎么想 我不在乎

487
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,440
你结婚了吗

488
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,640
有关系吗

489
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,160
你老婆知道你用手机应用找男人吗

490
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
你的介绍上说"不能留宿"

491
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,440
那么我想她应该不知道

492
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,920
就算她知道也不会比你

493
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,520
现在涉嫌一起连环谋杀案更重要

494
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
你最好实话实说

495
00:28:21,694 --> 00:28:23,294
他老婆走了
His wife was away.

496
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:24,283
他最后跟几个
He ended up with some guys in a flat

497
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:26,254
不知道住哪里的男人在公寓里
whose address he can't remember.

498
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:27,566
他一醒来...
And when he woke up...

499
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:29,134
我知道了 他还是想不起来
I see where it's going. So, no idea?

500
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:30,248
他真的想不起来
He honestly can't remember a thing

501
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,614
关于酗酒 吸毒 性交的任何事情了
about it: the alcohol, drugs, sex...

502
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:34,334
而且这些事情发生在一年前
And it all happened a year ago.

503
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:36,134
你看过酒吧里面的闭路电视没有
You checking the bar's CCTV?

504
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,374
- 看过了 - 有什么发现
- Yeah. - High hopes?

505
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:39,734
没有
No.

506
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:42,134
苏珊娜・博蒙特刚刚醒了 我试图和她谈话
Susanna Beaumont was awake. I managed to speak to her.

507
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:44,814
- 发现什么吗 - 我不知道
- Anything interesting? - I don't know.

508
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:48,814
好的 明天早上再和你说吧
Okay. I'll speak to you in the morning.

509
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:49,934
你在干什么
What are you doing?

510
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:51,254
做晚餐
Making dinner.

511
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,454
夜晚的医院
Hospitals at night, eh?

512
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:56,634
- 怎么了 - 真是个奇怪的地方
- What? - Strange places.

513
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:05,454
我喜欢晚上的医院
I like hospitals at night.

514
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:12,054
他们完全属于自己
They're...completely their own thing.

515
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:15,534
这说的通吗
Does that make any sense?

516
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:17,534
当然
Yeah.

517
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,254
晚餐愉快
Enjoy your dinner.

518
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
这地方真不错

519
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,040
是的 我好喜欢来这里

520
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
你真古怪

521
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,360
那些沉迷网络不接触现实世界的人才古怪

522
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,240
想进去吗

523
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,480
想 怎么进去

524
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,800
从这爬到屋顶然后你就可以进去了

525
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,520
懂了 蜘蛛侠

526
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,200
- 你确定 - 是的

527
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:39,654
早上好
Ah, morning.

528
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:42,894
能不能一起喝杯咖啡
Any chance of a coffee?

529
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:47,114
把你捡到的钱投进去
Put that euro you found in there.

530
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,854
闭路电视上发现什么吗
Anything off the bar CCTV?

531
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,414
没有 
No.

532
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:56,614
我搜索了我的记忆之屋 但是找不到
I tried that house of memories thing. Didn't work.

533
00:30:56,694 --> 00:31:00,254
- 没有吗 -没有 在洗衣房迷路了
- No? - No. Got lost in the laundry room.

534
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,854
可能这有点吓到你
This might come as a bit of a shock to you,

535
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:06,978
但是我想我们的室内装潢
but I suspect our inner landscapes

536
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:08,094
应该大有不同
differ quite significantly.

537
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:09,654
但愿吧
Well, I hope so.

538
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:13,908
不如哪天你告诉我你的房子吧
Will you tell me about your house one day?

539
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:15,352
不
No.

540
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:17,814
不想都知道
Thought not.

541
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
快来

542
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,520
这里好臭

543
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,280
我们当时就住在附近 这里以前是一个酒库

544
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,600
看 那有张床

545
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,480
别太兴奋 走了一夜我好累

546
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
那是什么

547
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,640
一些旧冰柜

548
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,600
会不会有酒啊

549
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,960
甚至香槟

550
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,040
来庆祝我逃离我爸爸

551
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,840
为什么他那么讨厌我

552
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,800
你非得知道答案吗

553
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,440
他会报警吗

554
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
不会啦

555
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,840
首先他会怪我妈妈然后再报警

556
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
那可不行 你妈妈很可爱的

557
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
为什么她要和他结婚

558
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:46,934
那是什么
What's that?

559
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:48,894
他又来了
He's in there again.

560
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:53,734
有两个人
There's two of them.

561
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,400
摄像头一直在拍让・克劳德 根本看不到他们

562
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,800
那袖子上是什么 截屏下来

563
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:06,160
看镜头 看镜头
Look into the camera. Look into the camera.

564
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
你还好吗 先生

565
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,240
- 他被绑起来了 我不能松绑 - 你是谁

566
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,480
- 快走 - 我们要帮你

567
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,720
快离开这里

568
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,960
- 快报警 - 这就是为什么人需要手机

569
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,160
- 你们帮不了我 - 这没信号

570
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
到外面去找信号

571
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,474
给我们看你们的脸 给我们看你们的脸
Show us your face. Show us your face.

572
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:31,774
或者离开这
Or get out of there.

573
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:33,774
一定有人在监视你们
You know who else must be watching.

574
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,560
- 离开这 - 她去求助了

575
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,280
我不能丢下你 先生

576
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,200
莉亚在报警 会没事的

577
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,240
天啊

578
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,760
一个女孩失踪了 莉亚・马丁

579
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,440
这夹克的样式和她妈妈描述的一样

580
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,720
她和男朋友私奔了 西蒙・马西尔

581
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,639
他们有电话吗

582
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,720
他没有 她关机了所以她父亲找不到她

583
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,719
我们搜查了他们的居住地并询问了他们的朋友

584
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,560
继续搜查任何能让我们知道他们位置的消息

585
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:35,042
两个孩子
Two kids?

586
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,960
也许这会让真理杀手相形见绌
Maybe that will take the shine off the Truth Terrorist.

587
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,159
还是联系不上他

588
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:45,782
不好意思
Excuse me.

589
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,159
也许他又换服务器了

590
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
也许...

591
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,480
他是很小心地策划这件事的

592
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,599
不会轻易放弃的

593
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:23,942
很好 你收到这个新电话了
Good, you received a new phone.

594
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,662
你不想让警察听到
You don't want the cops listening.

595
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:29,262
这是你和我之间的谈话
These conversations are just for you and me.

596
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:30,702
我真是受宠若惊
I suppose I'm flattered.

597
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:33,502
那么
So?

598
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:36,822
你想让我把什么公布于众
What do you want me to tell the world?

599
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:37,982
问我个问题
Ask me a question.

600
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:40,822
好的
All right.

601
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,422
信号断后发生了什么事
What happened when the feed went dead?

602
00:35:44,502 --> 00:35:47,702
其他人都是谁还有为什么你要挂断线
Who were the other people and why did you go offline?

603
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:48,742
下个问题
Next question.

604
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:57,142
那个人还活着吗
Is the man still alive?

605
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,182
是的
Yes.

606
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:03,102
为什么有五个真相
Why five truths?

607
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:05,262
这之后你会停手吗
What, are you just going to stop after that?

608
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:07,462
现在说这个还为时尚早
We are a long way from that point still.

609
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,582
你到底想怎样
What do you want?

610
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:14,102
你做这一切是为了什么
What is all this getting you?

611
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:15,938
为了接近真相
Closer to the truth.

612
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:19,632
我们都离真相越来越近了
We're all getting closer to the truth.

613
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:22,982
那么...接下来你要做什么
So...what's next?

614
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:25,262
我手里的那个老人还有救
The old man I'm holding can be saved.

615
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:28,662
用你的报纸告诉大家
Use your newspaper to tell people that.

616
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:31,182
他还有救
He can be saved.

617
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:32,702
怎么救
How?

618
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:36,382
怎么救
How?

619
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:58,462
苏菲
hey, Sophie.

620
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,542
最近怎么样
How's it going?

621
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,422
还不错
Fine.

622
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:06,462
很好
Good.

623
00:37:07,582 --> 00:37:08,902
我爸爸在吗
Is my dad here?

624
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:09,992
他出海了
He had to go to sea,

625
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:13,022
他...买了艘新船所以他...
he's, erm, got a new ship that he had to...

626
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:21,742
我们去那边坐会
Come sit with me a minute.

627
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:25,822
你不能每次和你妈妈吵架
You can't keep turning up like this

628
00:37:25,902 --> 00:37:27,782
都跑来我这里
every time you have a row with your mother.

629
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,142
我们之间有监护的规定
There's a custody order.

630
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:31,582
因为格蕾丝根本不想见到我
Because Grace doesn't want to see me.

631
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,382
你要理解她
You have to understand her too.

632
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:37,222
她觉得我更偏爱你
She feels I prefer you to the little ones.

633
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:39,462
我喜欢那种感觉
I'd love to have that feeling.

634
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:42,942
汤姆只有四岁
Tom's only four.

635
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:44,422
洁米才九个月大
Jamie's only nine months.

636
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:46,862
和他们比你是个大姑娘了 几乎是成人了
Compared to them you're a big girl. Almost a grown-up.

637
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:48,422
我可以在这过夜
I can stay the night though,

638
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:50,582
这不违反监护规定
that's not against the custody order.

639
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:54,222
事实上 今晚是汤姆的生日宴会
The thing is, it's Tom's birthday party this evening

640
00:37:54,302 --> 00:37:57,062
并且格蕾丝一家人都要在这过夜
and Grace's family are all staying the night.

641
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,182
我们没有多余的房间了
We don't have room.

642
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:04,702
好啦 我知道你能处理好和你妈的关系
Come on, I know you can sort things out with your mother.

643
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:08,902
需要我送你回去吗
You want me to drive you back?

644
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:17,582
有什么需要就给我打电话 好吗
Call me if you need anything, eh?

645
00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:25,542
有个小男孩在牧场里玩
And there was a little boy in the field.

646
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,782
他看上去很可爱 但不会说英语
Ever so sweet, he was. Didn't have a word of English.

647
00:38:28,862 --> 00:38:30,062
你说的妈妈是...
And you said the mum...?

648
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,502
她非常奇怪
She was really strange.

649
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:33,662
看上去好像有人刚打过她
And it looked as though someone had just hit her.

650
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:35,942
之后 当我经过时 门是开着的
And later, when I walked past, the door was open

651
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,542
但是没有人在那
but there was nobody there.

652
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:40,382
我不想给他们找麻烦
I don't want to get them into trouble.

653
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:41,942
"宽以待人"是我的格言
"Live and let live" is my motto.

654
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:45,542
我也是  除非他们是托特纳姆的球迷
Mine too. Well, unless they're Tottenham.

655
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,382
我真的很担心他们
I'm really worried about them.

656
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:49,782
这不对劲 那里肯定发生了什么
It's just not right, what goes on in there.

657
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:29,582
抱歉 姑娘 我们打烊了
Sorry, love, I'm closed.

658
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,502
你站在那里做什么
Why are you standing there?

659
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:05,062
关你什么事
What's it to you?

660
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:08,142
你都湿透了 一定很冷
You look cold and wet.

661
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:12,182
那是因为这雨天太冷了
That's because it's freezing and raining.

662
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:16,902
你不能站在这里
You can't stand there.

663
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:22,582
你脸上是雨水还是你在哭
Is that rain on your face or are you crying?

664
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:30,622
我正准备泡杯茶
I was just about to have a cup of tea.

665
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,982
如何你愿意 可以给你来一杯
There's enough for two if you want one.

666
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:41,262
抱歉 姑娘
Sorry, love.

667
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:06,822
放弃了吗
Given up, eh?

668
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,022
- 进展如何 - 很好
- How's it going? - Good.

669
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:11,782
虽然只工作了八年 但这次我确信
It's only been eight years but I'm confident this time.

670
00:41:11,862 --> 00:41:13,382
就我而言是五年
Five in my case.

671
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:14,330
不错
Well done.

672
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
孩子们有消息吗

673
00:41:16,396 --> 00:41:17,398
没有

674
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,760
每次他有动作 我都能更了解他

675
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,920
我已经开始明白他的规则了

676
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,120
你觉得他遵守规则吗

677
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:30,142
是的
Yes.

678
00:41:31,182 --> 00:41:33,102
我们都遵守规则
We all follow rules.

679
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:37,542
那只狗和孩子们不在他的计划中
The dog and the kids he hadn't planned on.

680
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:40,062
- 它抛弃了他 - 我知道他的感受
- It threw him. - I know how he feels.

681
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:42,542
是啊 他让一个人又重操旧业了
Yeah. It'd drive a man back to cigarettes.

682
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,502
你的法语有进步
Your French is getting better.

683
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:48,022
- 谢谢 - 你要走吗
- Merci. - You're leaving?

684
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:49,262
是的
Yep.

685
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,242
我和你一起走
I'll come down with you.

686
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,240
别一整晚盯在这 去睡会吧

687
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:58,782
等我取下东西
I'll get my stuff.

688
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,702
晚安
Bonne nuit.

689
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:09,342
我受邀去巴黎工作 永久性的
I've been asked to go to Paris, permanently.

690
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,502
比起加莱谁能不选择去巴黎
Well, who could possibly choose Paris over Calais?

691
00:42:16,582 --> 00:42:18,822
你喜欢爱丽丝
You like Elise?

692
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:20,862
- 怎么看出来的 - 任何地方
- In what sense? - In any sense.

693
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:23,782
她是个好警察
She's a good cop.

694
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:26,302
是我合作过的最好的
Best I ever worked with.

695
00:42:26,382 --> 00:42:28,302
当然 不是谁都能理解她的
Not everybody gets her, of course.

696
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:31,382
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Night. - Night.

697
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:32,542
车不错
Nice car.

698
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,262
恭喜你得到巴黎的工作
Congratulations on the Paris job.

699
00:42:37,342 --> 00:42:39,382
我还没有告诉爱丽丝
I haven't spoke to Elise about it yet.

700
00:42:39,462 --> 00:42:41,522
先别告诉任何人
Keep it to yourself for now.

701
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:04,942
我这只有绿茶
I've only got green tea.

702
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:07,448
很好了
That's great.

703
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:57,082
你为什么哭
Why were you crying?

704
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,222
家庭琐事
Family stuff.

705
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:07,582
常有的事
That happens.

706
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:24,462
我不能回家
I can't go home.

707
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:31,462
如果你愿意就呆在这里
Stay here if you want.

708
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:34,582
- 这里 - 你可以睡那边的床
- Here? - You can sleep on the bed in there.

709
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:36,982
这只有一间卧室
There's only one bedroom.

710
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:38,822
我可以睡我的瑜伽垫上
I sleep on my yoga mat.

711
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:41,702
真的 你睡床吧
Really, take the bed.

712
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:46,342
最近都没人用过所以床单很干净
It hasn't been used recently so the sheets are clean.

713
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:54,402
也许我妈现在会有点失眠
Maybe my mum will lose a bit of sleep now.

714
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:19,462
菲利普 菲利普
Philippe! Philippe!

715
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,080
他很冷

716
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:33,182
他又在线上了
He's back online.

717
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:39,742
老人在冬天一般会怎样
What happens to old people in winter?

718
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,760
{\an8}救他

719
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,240
{\an8}他们能救他
