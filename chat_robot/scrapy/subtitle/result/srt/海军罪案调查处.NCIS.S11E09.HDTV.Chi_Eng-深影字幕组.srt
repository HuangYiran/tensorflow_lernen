朱姆沃尔特级驱逐舰

00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:09,948
需要海军和生产厂家的通力合作
Demanding the best from the Navy

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,733
才能将梦想化为现实

5
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:17,523
你们四位是新一代美国国防公司的代表
You four represent the next wave of U.S. defense companies

6
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:20,709
是你们致力于改善士兵们的生存状况
who will improve the lives of our military personnel

7
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,904
保证他们的安全 强化他们的装备 
by keeping them safer and better equipping them

8
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:24,413
他们才能更好地保家卫国
to defend us.

9
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:27,249
先生们 一语以概之...
Gentlemen, together...

10
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:30,836
我们代表着国家海军的未来
we are the future of the United States Navy.

11
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:35,090
秘书官波特女士
Madam Secretary Porter,

12
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,476
为什么我们的标志比马克的小
why is my logo smaller than Marc's?

13
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:39,645
贝灵哲海运今年为海军
Beringer Marine laid down a million tons

14
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,146
贡献了一百万吨原钢
of raw steel this year.

15
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,881
而联合分点只提供小螺丝钉而已
United Equinox made a tiny screw.

16
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,652
我们提供的小螺丝钉
we made a teeny, tiny screw

17
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:50,772
可以承受一千两百度的温度变化
that could withstand a 1,200 degree temperature swing.

18
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:53,075
而且总数多得吓死你
And we made a crap-ton of them.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,085
又按错什么东西了吗 麦基?
Is this another dramatic touch, McGee?

20
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,236
不是的 秘书官女士
Not exactly, Madam Secretary.

21
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,005
网络防护装置检测到
Network security detected

22
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,124
某种未授权的电子信号
an unauthorized electronic transmission.

23
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,059
所有装置自动关闭
Everything shuts down automatically.

24
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:13,045
你是指外部的网络攻击吗?
Does that mean someone's trying to hack in from the outside?

25
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,098
不 这种模式只在发生内部攻击时启用
No. Lockdown only happens if the attack's internal.

26
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,435
攻击就发生在这间屋子里面
The threat's in this room.

27
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:24,452
海军罪案调查组 第十一季第九集

00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,003
我最近重看了一遍 太空城
I just reread Moonraker.

30
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,639
整个礼拜天都花在这个上面
Spent the whole day reading on Sunday.

31
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:59,725
真是好久没有这样了
Don't remember the last time that happened.

32
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:02,394
你经常看书吗?
You read a lot?

33
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:05,314
昨天晚上我出去喝酒
You know, I went out for a drink last night,

34
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,149
认识了一个女孩
and I met a girl.

35
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,268
笑起来很甜 身材一级棒
Great smile, great body.

36
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,521
你猜她是做什么的?
Guess what she does for a living.

37
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,908
我在考虑要不要去做变性手术 诺玛
I'm thinking about getting a sex change, Norma.

38
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,861
你在跟我说话吗 迪诺左探员?
You say something, Agent DiNozzo?

39
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:22,981
我只是想说话活跃一下气氛
I'm just trying to make conversation.

40
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,118
和我说话吗?
With me?

41
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:24,750
没错
Yeah.

42
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:26,818
我刚刚没有在听
I wasn't listening.

43
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:29,988
再说一次
Start over.

44
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,790
真的吗?
Really?

45
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,014
我猜跟我约会的那个妞是网球运动员
So, I guess it turns out that I'm dating a tennis pro.

46
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,433
猜猜她怎么给我电话号码的?
Want to know how she gave me her number?

47
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:43,935
枕头上给我留了这个
Boop! Left it on her pillow.

48
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,356
你在听吗?
Hello.

49
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:48,807
挺好的
That's nice.

50
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,642
这就完了?
That's it?

51
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:52,227
你想让我说什么?
What do you want?

52
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,229
有点反应好嘛
Well, a little something.

53
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:56,898
嘲笑啊 鄙视啊 都可以啊
Just a jibe, a scoff, a little stink-eye, you know?

54
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,349
我... 需要看到你有点情绪什么的
I just... I need something.

55
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,018
评论两句 给我个"呸"什么的
The riff, the pattere "p, th."

56
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,455
你开始有鄙视的眼神了 很好
Oh, you got a stink-eye in there. I can see it.

57
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:06,491
听着 再来一个"呸"就行了
Listen, I just need the "pah."

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,328
探员麦基在哪里? 
Where's Agent McGee?

59
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,547
不应该把重担都给蒂姆一个人挑
The burden shouldn't always fall on Tim.

60
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:14,249
他够辛苦的了
He's suffered enough.

61
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:15,634
探员吉布斯呢?
What about Agent Gibbs?

62
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:18,220
嘿 老大 我和一个网球运动员在约会
Hey, boss, dating a tennis pro.

63
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,638
挺好的
That's nice.

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,473
我们出发
Let's go.

65
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:22,808
看到了吧 就是这样?
See?

66
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,093
发现尸体了吗?
We got a body?

67
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:28,880
是内部破坏
It's a breach.

68
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:30,399
我们不开车
We're not driving.

69
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,983
去哪里?
Where we going?

70
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:33,185
楼上
Upstairs.

71
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:37,322
怎么回事 莱昂?
What's happening, Leon?

72
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:39,024
安全模式下
In secure mode,

73
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,522
多重威胁预警中心的探测器
MTAC sensors constantly

74
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,395
会定期扫描电子信号
scan for electronic signals.

75
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,614
只要有非机构内的任何东西
Anything other than our equipment

76
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:48,283
发射出无线频率信号 房间就锁死
emits a radio frequency, room goes on lockdown.

77
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,236
不找到发射来源 没有人能离开这里
Nobody's allowed to leave till we find the source.

78
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,570
你是说监视器 窃听器什么的
Like a surveillance device, a bug.

79
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:53,672
是的
Right.

80
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,674
- 这种情况经常发生吗? - 不经常 
- Does this happen a lot? - No.

81
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:58,293
脑子坏了才带这种东西来安全室
Not the brightest idea to bring one into a secure room.

82
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,795
所以他们才搜查你两遍 马克
That's why they're gonna check you twice, Marc.

83
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:00,796
省省吧 沃德
Save it, Ward.

84
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:02,964
现在可不是斗嘴的时候
Not exactly the time.

85
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,583
清查完毕
All clear.

86
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,719
我扫描了每一处角落 老大
I've scanned every square inch, boss.

87
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,629
座椅 墙壁 电脑台...
Seats, walls, computer console...

88
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,422
没有发现非法设备
no sign of any illicit devices.

89
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,297
假警报? 软件错误?
False alarm? Software glitch?

90
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:13,859
都有可能
Possible.

91
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,277
这么说可以允许
Does that mean we're free to let

92
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,279
我们的重要合作伙伴离开了 主任?
our valued corporate partners go, Director?

93
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:19,147
可以解除锁定了 伙计们
You can take us off lockdown, fellas.

94
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,431
- 是的 长官 - 先生们 这边走
- Yes, sir. - Gentlemen, please.

95
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:30,709
又发生故障了吗?
Another malfunction?

96
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:32,661
你不是每个人都搜过了吗 迪诺左探员?
I thought you searched everyone, Agent DiNozzo.

97
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,496
我以为你不想让我对国家秘书官
I didn't think you wanted me to pat down

98
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,748
进行贴身搜查呢 长官
the United States Secretary of the Navy, sir.

99
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,917
现在需要你这样做
Well, I do now.

100
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,558
请把胳膊抬起来 女士
Uh, raise your arms, please, ma'am.

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,343
我也没有办法 家里有两张嘴要养活
Just remember, I have mouths to feed.

102
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:49,928
两条金鱼
Two goldfish.

103
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,462
我可是家里的顶梁柱
I'm their only source of income,

104
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,631
而且他们超级... 无敌可爱
and they're-they're awfully cute.

105
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:56,101
放心 迪诺左 我跟你一样好奇
Relax, DiNozzo. I'm as anxious about this as you are.

106
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,530
我要搜查你的口袋 女士
I'm gonna have to search your pockets, ma'am.

107
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,415
你身上有什么针一类的锋利物品吗?
Do you have any needles or sharp objects?

108
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:11,482
这是流程
I have to ask.

109
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:13,752
没有 继续
No. Proceed.

110
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,961
一支笔?
A pen?

111
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:26,131
真把我吓了一跳呢 先生们
You had me worried for a moment, gentlemen.

112
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,855
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell's that?

113
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,362
初步判定 
Well, first impression,

114
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:38,676
是带闪存盘的针孔麦克风
it's a flash drive connected to a pinhole microphone.

115
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:40,395
找到窃听器了
We got our bug.

116
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:42,614
居然是我带进来的
I'm the breach.

117
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,293
好吧 我来澄清一下
Okay, let's clear the air right now.

118
00:05:57,294 --> 00:06:00,795
我不知道是何时何地拿到那支笔的
I have no idea when or where I got that pen.

119
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:02,597
可能是在医生办公室 银行 酒店
Could have been a doctor's office, bank, restaurant.

120
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,432
印象中上次用这支笔
The last time I remember using it

121
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:08,186
是在昨天早上给女儿签许可单的时候 
was when I signed a permission slip for my daughter yesterday morning.

122
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:10,355
一定是那个时候我拿起来放到兜里了
And I must have put the pen in my pocket after that,

123
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:13,358
但是我真的不知道那是一个窃听器
but I had no idea it was recording me.

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,810
知道了
Okay.

125
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:18,446
你相信我吗?
You believe that?

126
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,605
是的
Yes.

127
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:20,532
为什么?
Why?

128
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,855
我尊敬你的人品
Respect.

129
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,523
还有部门的信誉
For you and the office.

130
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,692
并且 除非有反向证据
And until there's evidence to the contrary,

131
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:34,128
否则你也只是有嫌疑而已 秘书官女士
you'll get the benefit of the doubt, Madam Secretary.

132
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,197
谢谢你 吉布斯探员
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

133
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,050
当务之急是在信息泄露之前
Job now is finding who's responsible

134
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:40,635
找到是谁做的
before anything leaks.

135
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:43,671
昨天三点
I had classified briefings

136
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:46,724
我在美国国防部的非常规地点参加了机密报告
at three D.O.D. off-site locations yesterday,

137
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,060
会上讨论了很多战略部署的内容
and we talked enough deployment strategy

138
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,878
一旦泄露会让我效力的海军
to cause serious security problems

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,064
面临严重的安全问题
for the sailors and Marines I work for.

140
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,985
这是我唯一担心的 吉布斯探员
Understand, they are my only concern in this, Agent Gibbs.

141
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:06,110
艾比拿到了那支间谍笔 老大
Abby's got the spy pen, boss.

142
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:09,563
根据电池总容量和剩余的电量
Based on the battery size and the length of the charge left,

143
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,417
我们推断窃听已经持续了三十个小时左右
we think it's been recording for about 30 hours or so.

144
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,620
可以追踪窃听者吗?
Can we track who's listening?

145
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:16,621
这个不是实时传送的
It's not a live feed.

146
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:17,956
窃听器会存储数据
The bug stores the data internally,

147
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,424
也就是说 无论是谁放的这个
which means whoever planted it

148
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:20,875
都得想办法把数据下载回去
has to download the info.

149
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:23,411
假设数据已经被下载了
Which we have to assume they've already done.

150
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:25,797
我会警告五角大楼 
All right, I will alert the Pentagon

151
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,881
我昨天参加的会议可能已经泄密
that my meetings yesterday were compromised.

152
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:28,933
我们应该让国安局介入调查
And we should bring in the NSA.

153
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:31,219
我刚刚申请跟进信息
I just put in a request for info.

154
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,088
他们有耳目专盯贩卖国家情报的事情
They got ears open for the sale of U.S. intel.

155
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,139
先确保事情还没有遭到那份儿上
Let's make sure it doesn't get that far.

156
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:36,424
你想怎么做我心里有数 老大
You zig, I zag, boss.

157
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:38,276
我和国安局打电话那段时间
While I was on the horn with NSA,

158
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:40,111
我拿到一份潜在威胁分析报告
I pulled a threat analysis report.

159
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:42,530
刚刚那十分钟他们就总结出报告了吗?
They put this together in the last ten minutes?

160
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,432
不 这是两年之前的报告
No. The paper's two years old.

161
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:46,367
但是文中确切地预示了这次外泄事件
But it predicts our breach exactly.

162
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,536
"隐秘录音设备
"Clandestine recording device,

163
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:50,938
高层职员
high-level government official,

164
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,874
日常用品
an everyday item

165
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:55,076
比如签字笔"
such as an ink pen."

166
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:57,662
巧合吗?
Coincidence?

167
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:01,449
我们得找撰写这份报告的人谈谈
We need to talk to the person who wrote this paper.

168
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:12,593
我还以为这里也要来次"清查"
I thought we were gonna get a cavity search coming in here.

169
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,929
真会说笑
Interesting.

170
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:16,097
嗯
Hmm

171
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,599
瞧啊 好家伙啊
Whoa, look at that.

172
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:22,520
最好别和麦基提这些 星际迷航 游戏座椅
We better not tell McGee about the Star Trek video game chairs.

173
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:25,306
说出来肯定让他羡慕嫉妒恨
It'll just irritate him.

174
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:27,775
这里像一个苹果商店一样
It's like an Apple Store.

175
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:29,444
两位来自海军罪案调查处吧
You must be NCIS.

176
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,746
欢迎来到国安局网路运营中心
Welcome to the National Security Operations Center.

177
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,198
我是国安局特别探员乍得・弗莱德林
I'm NSA Special Agent Chad Flynderling.

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,433
叫我弗莱林就可以
You can call me Flynn.

179
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:36,534
弗莱林
Flynn.

180
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:37,478
好比 电子世界争霸战 
Like Jeff Bridges

181
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,336
里的杰夫・布里奇斯?
in Tron?

182
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:41,205
那是原创
That's original.

183
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,840
抱歉 请见谅
Sorry. I'm sorry.

184
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,626
目前我对国安局的公众认知尤为敏感
I'm sensitive to NSA's public perception right now.

185
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,496
可别把我这当成数据狂人扎墩儿的避世宝地
We're not just a bunch of reclusive data nerds.

186
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:51,265
这里经手的工作五花八门 员工也是形形色色
Our employees are as diverse as the work that we do here.

187
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,334
我发誓 我再听到
And I swear, if I have to hear another crack

188
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:54,602
关于 星际迷航 座椅的玩笑...
about the Star Trek chairs...

189
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:56,504
嘿 可瞧仔细了
Oh, hey, look at those.

190
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,272
都没有注意到他们
Didn't even notice them.

191
00:08:58,274 --> 00:09:00,725
我浏览过你问到的威胁报告
I reviewed the threat report you called about.

192
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,643
- 你写的吗? - 不是
- You write it? - Well, no.

193
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,862
你有什么需要 我可以协助你调查
Uh, but I can assist you with anything you might need.

194
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:07,198
我们要找的是原作者
We asked for the original author.

195
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,786
第一准则 按要求办事
Make it so, Number One.

196
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:14,572
有什么为难的?
What's the problem?

197
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:16,324
嗯
Hmm

198
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:20,545
要说那些不食人间烟火的数据狂人...
About those reclusive data freaks I was talking about...

199
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:43,050
这得等多久?
So how long does this go on?

200
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,903
等等就好
Yeah, just wait for it.

201
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:56,114
吉布斯 迪诺左探员
Uh, Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo,

202
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:58,065
向你们介绍国安局的数据分析员
I give you NSA Analyst

203
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,200
艾丽・毕晓普
Ellie Bishop.

204
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:00,918
她宁愿选在这里
She prefers to do her

205
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,870
完成手头无需避讳的工作
unclassified research in here.

206
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:05,406
我想我们早就谈妥首要准则了 弗莱林
I thought we discussed rule number one, Flynn.

207
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:07,759
只要我戴着耳机 就不闻"窗外事"
When my earbuds are in, flash the desk light.

208
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:08,793
这次由不得我做主
Couldn't help it.

209
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,344
我是毕晓普
Bishop.

210
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,380
幸会
It's good to meet you.

211
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:16,050
抱歉 我正忙... 赶工
Sorry, I was in the middle of... stuff.

212
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:19,437
没错 我写的 怎么了?
Yup. That's my work. What's up?

213
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,588
你看都没看就知道啊
You didn't even look at it.

214
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,423
我来国安局的第三天写的
I wrote it my third day at the NSA.

215
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,474
一个周三早晨
It was a Wednesday morning.

216
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:26,027
我刚吃完一盒可可麦脆片
I just finished a box of Cocoa Pebbles.

217
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,946
我清楚记得是因为
I remember that because it was

218
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:31,282
盒子里面的奖品 激发了我的写作灵感
the prize inside the box that inspired the entire paper.

219
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:33,534
我来猜猜 奖品是一支笔?
Let me guess. A pen?

220
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,436
显而易见的日常用品
An everyday object hiding in plain sight.

221
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:37,455
灵感一触即发
It clicked.

222
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,957
你那洋洋洒洒二十五页之多的国家安全策略
So you got 25 pages of national security strategy

223
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,610
就来源于早餐麦片?
from inside a breakfast cereal?

224
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:44,328
为了更好地防御各种袭击
In order to better prepare for attacks,

225
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,080
我虚构了一些尚未发生过的威胁
I dream up threats that haven't happened yet.

226
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:47,381
你倒是一梦成谶
This dream came true.

227
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,801
被我言中了啊
So I was right.

228
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:52,786
海军部长被窃听
Secretary of the Navy was bugged.

229
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,789
安全情报人员岌岌可危
Security intel is at risk.

230
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,259
真是够呛
Which is bad.

231
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,678
但是我把报告交给我的上司
But I submit my reports to my superiors,

232
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,313
随后又发放给相应人员
who then distribute them accordingly.

233
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:05,099
但是凡有基本安全许可的人都能接触到
Anyone with basic security clearance could have access.

234
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,114
这份报告你有给过其他人吗?
Did you give this paper to anybody else?

235
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,437
没有
No.

236
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,638
你是想问我有参与此事吗?
Are you asking if I'm in on it or something?

237
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,159
没... 没有的事情...
Uh, no, I... I'm not, I...

238
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:16,661
我只动笔写了脚本 
I wrote the playbook, but I have

239
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,029
但是我真不知道谁负责操作
no idea who's running it.

240
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,115
抱歉
Sorry.

241
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,501
希望你能找到嫌犯
Hope you find your guy.

242
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:25,670
总之是幸会
It was nice to meet you.

243
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,824
我刚刚就说过
Like I said,

244
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,460
她不做外勤
she's not a field agent.

245
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:33,711
我可不聋 杰夫・丹尼尔斯
I can still hear you, Jeff Daniels.

246
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:34,828
电子世界争霸战 里面就没有这么个人
Jeff Daniels wasn't in Tron.

247
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,597
那个人叫杰夫・布里奇斯
That was Jeff Bridges.

248
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:39,133
弗莱林 你竟然是电影忠粉呢
Flynn, you are a fan.

249
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,668
喂 达克?
Yeah, Duck?

250
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,272
是的 这就回去
Yep, we're on our way back.

251
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:46,023
又发现一支窃听笔
We have got a second pen.

252
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,308
所以我想...
So I guess this means

253
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,726
- 我跟你们走一趟 - 不行
- I'm riding with you guys. - No.

254
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:49,861
你不行 她去
No, but she is.

255
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:50,954
什么? 为什么? 
What? Why?

256
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:51,946
什么? 为什么?
What? Why?

257
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:58,018
正如你承认的
'Cause, like you said,

258
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,988
脚本是你写的 对吧?
you wrote the playbook, right?

259
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:15,536
在这呆着做什么?
What are we doing here?

260
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:17,755
等达克过来 这里的法医
I'm waiting for Ducky, our M.E.

261
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:20,708
通俗点说就是"验尸员"
That stands for "medical examiner."

262
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,061
我又不是没见过这场面
This isn't my first case.

263
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:26,547
我想知道的是要我来做什么?
I meant, what am I doing here?

264
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,382
我分析巨幅数据
I analyze big-picture data,

265
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:31,652
为全球反恐战争制定详细策略
present detailed strategies in the global war on terror.

266
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:35,656
每一步棋都得花上几年时间来部署
Chess moves that can take years to implement.

267
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,491
你喜欢下棋?
You enjoy playing board games?

268
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,529
听着 我能提供的所有信息都在那份报告里面
Look, everything I can offer you is in that report.

269
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,063
我人在这里有什么用吗?
What good can I do in person?

270
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,749
说不好 但是你可以
I don't know, but you can start

271
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,167
先补看下卷宗
by catching up on the case file.

272
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,535
是的
Yes.

273
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:50,037
那你能给一个时限吗?
Well, then, can you tell me how long?

274
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,923
当然我可以等
Of course I can hold on.

275
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:54,842
估计你不是联调局的人 你来就是想
I don't suppose you're from the FBI and you've come to tell me

276
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:56,427
告诉我一切都是误会?
that all this is a misunderstanding?

277
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,511
抱歉 我是国安局的 我叫...
Sorry, NSA. My name...

278
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:59,764
这就不沾一点边
That is totally irrelevant.

279
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:02,133
我十分钟前刚刚和那个人联系过
I was just talking to the man ten minutes ago.

280
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:04,635
华府的法医故意不接我电话
The D.C. M.E. is dodging my calls.

281
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,687
达克 我还以为你说的是窃听器
Duck, I thought this was about another bug,

282
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:08,589
- 没有想到有尸体 - 都有
- not a body. - It's both.

283
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:12,310
多亏全境通告 那个法医又发现一支窃听笔
Thanks to our BOLO, the M.E. found a second pen

284
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:15,095
在他再次排查这个人的个人物品时发现的
when he went back through this man's personal effects.

285
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:16,280
他叫做克洛德・谢尔曼
He's Claude Sherman,

286
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,315
联合分点电子的会计师
accountant for United Equinox Electronics.

287
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:19,033
是的 他今早去过
Yeah, he worked

288
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:21,068
多方反恐警报中心一下设公司工作
for one of the companies in MTAC this morning.

289
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,620
谋杀吗?
Murder?

290
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,238
不是 自然死亡
No, natural causes.

291
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,907
两天前突发心肌梗塞
Myocardial infarction two days ago.

292
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:27,941
达克 那么尸体怎么到我们这里来了?
Ducky, then what's he doing here?

293
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:29,327
尸体与个人物品结伴而行
Body and personal effects travel together

294
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,045
以免断了证据链
in order to preserve the chain of evidence.

295
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:34,048
我早就说过 我是老手
Like I said, this is not my first case.

296
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,666
停下
Stop.

297
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,501
- 达克 那支笔呢? - 找不到了
- Ducky, where's the pen? - It's missing.

298
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:40,221
所以我这一整早儿都在打电话
That's why I've been on the phone all morning.

299
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:50,648
是的 经由
Yeah, according

300
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,899
验尸办公室确认
to the M.E.'s office,

301
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:52,869
一名联邦调查局探员
an FBI agent

302
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,268
在九点十五分的转移工作之前
collected the personal effects

303
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,021
整理收集了他的个人财物
just before the transfer at 0915.

304
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,273
问题是当我打电话确认时
The problem is, when I called to confirm,

305
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,308
联邦调查局却声称对此毫不知情
the FBI doesn't know anything about it.

306
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,310
- 有人伪装成了探员 - 看来是这样的
- Somebody posing as an agent. - It would appear so.

307
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:06,664
给我们留下一具尸体以及更多的问题
Leaving us a body and more questions.

308
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,332
是谁偷了这支笔?
Who stole the pen?

309
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,917
是把它安插在海军秘书官的身上的
Was it the same person who planted it

310
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,252
那个人吗?
on SECNAV?

311
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:14,088
这之间有什么联系?
What's the connection?

312
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,042
抱歉... 你怎么称呼?
I'm sorry... what was your name again?

313
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:18,959
毕晓普
Bishop.

314
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,595
你有头绪了?
You got something?

315
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,497
是的 呃 算是吧
Yeah, uh, maybe.

316
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,800
你们这边有吃的吗?
You got any food around here?

317
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,885
随便什么都行
Anything?

318
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,640
我们会找到的 快来
We'll find stuff. Come on.

319
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,863
五角大楼拒绝提供关于海军秘书官的
Pentagon refuses to release any of the minutes

320
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:40,231
任何会议记录
from SECNAV's briefings.

321
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,116
一旦情报泄露 全世界都会知道的
Once the intel leaks, the whole world will know.

322
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:43,701
是的 我也是这么告诉他们的
Yeah, it's what I told them,

323
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:45,012
但是他们只关心些关于俄罗斯
except all they could say was,

324
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:46,019
中国 叙利亚 伊朗
topics of discussion

325
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:48,873
之类的议题
included Russia, China, Syria and Iran.

326
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,990
那倒是缩小了范围
That narrows it down.

327
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:51,742
是的
Yeah.

328
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:52,710
那就是她?
That her?

329
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:53,994
她都下到这里来了?
She fall down?

330
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:57,331
哦 呃 别在意我这边这么乱
Oh, uh, don't let the chaos fool you.

331
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,417
我就是这么工作的
This is just how I work.

332
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:02,553
好吧 科学怪人
All right, Jeff Goldblum,

333
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,672
有人在海军秘书官身上安插了窃听器
guy plants a bug on SECNAV,

334
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:05,706
并获取了窃听的内容
uploads the data.

335
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,807
他要这些信息做什么?
What's he do with it?

336
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,926
说吧
Go.

337
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:10,928
你们读过我的论文了吗?
Did you read my paper?

338
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,546
读了... 一部分 但是我...
Some... some of it, but I...

339
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:15,433
时间很紧 我...
Time is a factor here, and I...

340
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,402
那是婚戒吗? 你结婚了吗?
Is that a wedding ring? Are you married?

341
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:20,571
今晚我就把报告发给你们 好吗?
I'll have my report to you by tonight, okay?

342
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:21,856
- 报告? - 嗯哼
- Report? - Mm-hmm.

343
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:22,890
今天晚上?
Tonight?

344
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,075
等等 回到刚刚那个话题
Wait, let's back the truck up.

345
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:25,443
你几岁?
How old are you?

346
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:26,994
不是说时间很紧吗
I thought time was a factor around here.

347
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,829
谈论我的个人隐私不是很浪费时间吗?
Isn't talking about my personal life a waste of it?

348
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:29,864
- 不是 - 是的
- No. - Yes.

349
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:31,282
依我所见 这个人
Well, the way I see it, our guy

350
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,084
有三个选择 其一 他会以信息披露的名义
has three options. One: he releases

351
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,169
把信息公布出去
the information in the name of full disclosure.

352
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,236
但是要是如此 他早就这么做了
Which he would have already done.

353
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:37,788
其二 他会把信息卖给我们的敌对势力 
Two: he sells the data to the enemy.

354
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,039
但是他不可能事先获悉
Except he had no way of knowing

355
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,458
自己能窃听到什么样的情报
what kind of intel the bug would record.

356
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,573
所以需要寻找合适的买家 
Needs to find the right buyer.

357
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:42,209
这就需要时间
Which takes time.

358
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:43,744
所以就只剩第三个选项了
Leaving us with option three:

359
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,713
他直接把信息卖还给我们
he sells the information back to us.

360
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,080
敲诈勒索
Extortion.

361
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:49,683
是的 呃 等等 那... 那只是我的猜测
Yeah, uh, wait, tha-that... that was just a guess.

362
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:50,918
我们得去警告海军秘书官办公室
We need to alert the SECNAV's office

363
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,886
这个人可能会打电话过去
this guy might be calling.

364
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,587
- 他联系过了 - 敲诈?
- He just did. - Extortion?

365
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,139
倒计时已经开始了
Clock's already started.

366
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,893
下午十二点三十分 海军秘书官办公室
12:30 p.m., SECNAV's office was contacted

367
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:12,560
收到一封加密的电子邮件
via an encrypted e-mail.

368
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,862
如果我们不在一个小时内向一个海外账户
We have one hour to deposit $10 million

369
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,365
汇款一千万美元的话 他就把情报泄露出去
into an offshore account or he leaks the intel.

370
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,483
我们能追踪到邮件来源吗?
Can we track the communication?

371
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,165
不能 发送这封邮件的人
No, who's ever behind this

372
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:19,784
懂得计算机的加密方法
knows their way

373
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,268
而且知道如何躲起来
around computer code and knows how to hide.

374
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,236
有没有可能
What are the chances

375
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:24,105
在汇款期限之前转到他?
of catching this guy before the deadline?

376
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:26,491
我们只要把钱汇过去就行了
Well, they get better if we just pay him.

377
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:31,496
- 他想要什么给他就是了 - 不行
- Give the man what he wants. - No.

378
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:32,463
我们不喜欢
We don't like

379
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:34,215
给恐怖分子任何东西
giving terrorists anything,

380
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,283
更别说是纳税人的钱了
much less taxpayer money.

381
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,665
我也是 
Neither do I,

382
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,285
但是就像我对我国安局的上司说得那样
but like I told my boss at NSA,

383
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,671
这是工作需要
it's the cost of doing business.

384
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:41,389
如果我们把钱汇到了那个账户
If we deposit the money into the account

385
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,808
并且他试图取钱 那我们就有迹可循了
and he accesses it, it gives us something to trace.

386
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,842
这都在我的论文中提到了
It's all outlined in my paper.

387
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:47,178
是这个间谍
Would that be the same paper our spy

388
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,896
可以用来参考的那篇论文吗?
could be using as a paint-by-numbers?

389
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,098
他会知道这是我们的战术
He'll know that's our strategy.

390
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,432
他不管怎样都会猜到的
He would have guessed it anyway,

391
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,267
这就成为了国安局与他解密技术的对抗了
which makes it our NSA codes against his.

392
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,688
从统计学上来说 我们的胜算更大
And statistically, the odds are in our favor.

393
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,607
这是我们找到他的最好办法
It's our best way of finding him.

394
00:16:58,609 --> 00:16:59,908
统计数据不会说谎
Statistics don't lie.

395
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,065
是的 但是我们要找的人会 
Yeah, but our bad guy might.

396
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,527
会说谎?
Lie?

397
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:03,611
- 说什么慌? - 我们不知道
- About what? - We don't know

398
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:05,947
关于他的任何信息或是他想要什么
anything about him or what he wants.

399
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,583
他要钱 不是吗?
He wants money, right?

400
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,418
前提是他确实没有留一手的话
Unless he hasn't shown his full hand.

401
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:13,621
继续搜集情报直到有所进展
Keep digging till we find it.

402
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:16,207
这一点... 一点都说不通
That doesn't... doesn't make sense.

403
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,709
有事你需要凭着直觉走
Sometimes you got to go with your gut.

404
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:20,044
没错 但是无论如何 我们都应该同意
Sure, but gut logic aside, I think we can all agree here

405
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:22,263
切实的逻辑推理更好
that actual logic is better.

406
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:23,631
那我们就拭目以待吧
Well, we're about to find out.

407
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,599
海军秘书官刚刚批准了
SECNAV just approved

408
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,050
毕晓普的计划方案
Bishop's game plan.

409
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,603
给国安局提供汇钱的方案
Gave NSA the lead on the money-drop.

410
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,556
波特有话要对我们说 吉布斯
Porter wants to have a word with us, Gibbs.

411
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:35,059
好的
Good.

412
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,042
我在我的公司会计身上
The same kind of surveillance device

413
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,027
找到了相同的窃听设备
was found on my corporate accountant.

414
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,995
我没有在你的雇员身上
I didn't plant

415
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,430
安插什么的窃听器
a bug on your employee,

416
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:57,632
而且我非常肯定
and I sure as hell didn't plant a bug

417
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,300
没有在海军部长的身上安插窃听器
on the Secretary of the Navy!

418
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,152
你有种就起诉我叛国罪试试
You got stones accusing me of treason.

419
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,620
没必要这么争锋相对
There's no sense pointing fingers.

420
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,021
别装什么爱国主义者 沃德
Quit playing the patriot, Ward.

421
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:04,980
我就是爱国主义者 
I am a patriot.

422
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,257
我们公司服务这一军事组织
My company's been serving this military

423
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,725
整整四代之久
for four generations.

424
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:10,394
我们可不是什么刚起家的战争投机者
We're not some startup war profiteer.

425
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:11,879
别说了
That's enough.

426
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,564
我理解你因为公司机密泄露
I understand you're concerned

427
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:14,682
而感到担忧
about corporate secrets being leaked.

428
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,267
就算没有泄露
Even if nothing leaks,

429
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,269
这种事也足够让我倾家荡产
word of this would kill me on Wall Street.

430
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,772
我们是在谈论数以亿记的资金
We're talking hundreds of millions.

431
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:22,389
我们已经着手调查
We are following up on the device

432
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,225
你雇员身上的窃听设备了 
found on your employee,

433
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:26,060
马克 但是你得给我们时间
Marc, but give us time to do our jobs.

434
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:27,394
我向你们保证
I can assure you both

435
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:28,557
我们所有最好的探员都在
that our best agents are

436
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:29,614
全天候地处理这一案件
working on this around the clock.

437
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,199
我没有说错吧 吉布斯探员?
Isn't that right, Agent Gibbs?

438
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:36,120
我很肯定我们刚刚才停手 秘书官女士
Oh, I'm pretty sure you just took us off the clock, ma'am.

439
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:42,293
两位 失陪一下
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me for a moment.

440
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,013
我已经被这事搞得焦头烂额了...
I'm getting hit on all sides with this...

441
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,515
五角大楼 白宫
Pentagon, White House.

442
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,301
谁都不想再见到任何其他情报丑闻
Last thing anybody needs is another intel scandal,

443
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,937
而国安局已经为这种威胁做好了准备
and NSA is prepared for this kind of threat.

444
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:54,272
我们也是 秘书官女士
So are we, Madam Secretary.

445
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,423
我需要你保持最好的工作状态 莱昂
And I want you to keep up the good work, Leon.

446
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:57,498
我不是要让你坐冷板凳 
I'm not benching you;

447
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,060
但是我需要更多选手来参与这场比赛
I'm just adding more players to the game.

448
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:01,229
不同的选手有着不同的本事
Different players have different strengths.

449
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:04,115
没错 作为教练 我对阵容
Yes, and as head coach, I have the lineup

450
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,317
有着话语权 主任
just the way I want it, Director.

451
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,104
明白了吗?
Is that understood?

452
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:14,826
每个人都关注着我这样一个
Everybody's looking

453
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:17,111
没有军事背景的女海军秘书官
at a female SECNAV with no military background,

454
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,963
质疑这两点是否会制约我
wondering if either one of those things

455
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:20,548
成为一个合格海军秘书官
are gonna be a factor.

456
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,617
我希望通过妥善处理此事 来回击他们
I'd like to answer them by setting this right.

457
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:28,756
因此 我需要竭尽全力得到大家的支持
And to do that, I need all the help I can get.

458
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:30,958
尤其是你们的帮助
Especially yours.

459
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,184
哦 上帝
Oh, God.

460
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:44,238
该死的钢笔 告诉我答案
Stupid pen, give me answers.

461
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:49,577
你在那里站多久了?
How long have you been standing there?

462
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,362
哦 几分钟而已
Oh, just a few minutes.

463
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,531
- 我以为你知道 - 不
- I thought you knew. - No.

464
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,666
但是你一直跟我说话来着
But you were talking to me.

465
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:59,203
不 我... 我在自言自语
No, I... I was talking to myself

466
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:01,589
还有和一支... 钢笔说话
and a... pen.

467
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:03,841
但是现在我不会再说话了
But now I'm not talking anymore,

468
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,659
谁知道 谁在听我说话 不是吗?
'cause who knows who's listening?

469
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:09,163
你认为谁在听你说话呢?
Who do you think's listening?

470
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,163
NSA

471
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:19,840
哦 不... 不要道听途说
Oh, no... don't believe everything you hear.

472
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,726
我的意思是 我们不会随意
I mean, we don't randomly listen

473
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:23,677
监听谈话和电话
to conversations and phone calls.

474
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:26,677
胡说八道

475
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,616
我是认真的
I'm serious.

476
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,517
和你们一样 我们需要得到许可才可以这样做
We need a court order just like you.

477
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,870
我们当中确实有不法分子
We've had a few bad apples,

478
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:34,822
但是我们都是好人
but we're good people

479
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:37,124
维护法律秩序 做出改变
out to uphold the law and make a difference.

480
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:40,378
那么 你没有监听我的电话?
So you haven't bugged my phone?

481
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:44,715
听着 我可以证明我是过来帮忙的
Look, I can prove I'm here to help.

482
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:46,968
我根据华府法医的描述画了这个
I drew this using D.C. examiner's description

483
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,086
我们正在寻找的那个冒牌联邦调查局探员
of our bogus FBI agent, fed it

484
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:51,222
通过在国家安全局的数据库里面搜索 
into the NSA database, and got a hit on a guy named

485
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:52,506
找到一位名为鲁道夫・斯大林的人
Rudolph Stalin.

486
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:53,674
鲁道夫・斯大林
Rudolph Stalin.

487
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:55,426
是的
Okay.

488
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:58,679
他是美国公民
Rudolph Stalin is an American citizen

489
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:01,699
有国际间谍案底
with a history of international espionage

490
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:04,101
与俄国有深厚的政治牵连
and strong political ties to Russia.

491
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:06,887
小胡子不错
And a very nice mustache.

492
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,856
我不知道是否算作一种讽刺
I wonder if it's supposed to be ironic.

493
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:10,408
我们已经监听他整整一年时间
He's been on our radar for about a year.

494
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,244
啊哈 嗯 他是美国公民
Aha, hmm, and he is an American citizen.

495
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:16,113
这就是我们需要许可的原因
Which is exactly why we needed a court order.

496
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,915
我记得几个月之前在读他的档案的时候
I remember reading his file a few months ago

497
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:22,036
我正在喝奶油蘑菇汤
over a bowl of cream of mushroom soup.

498
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,673
我... 我通常使用食物来联想记忆
I... I food-associate.

499
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,925
哦
Oh.

500
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:29,444
我... 我只是... 
I... I'm just...

501
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:30,962
我对你绘画的本事表示诧异
I'm still stuck on the fact that you can draw.

502
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,183
我的意思是 虽然没有凯特画得好 
I mean, this isn't Kate good,

503
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:34,432
但是还是非常不错的
but it's good good.

504
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:35,433
谁是凯特?
Who's Kate?

505
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:38,102
这... 这需要花费几个小时
That... that would take a few hours

506
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,721
和整整一盒纸巾来讲述
and a whole box of tissues.

507
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:43,224
好的 那么 我们先发布通缉令吧
Okay, well, then we should get this BOLO out first,

508
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,776
然后我去调查一下国家安全局那边进展如何
and I wanted to check up on the NSA operation.

509
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:47,728
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

510
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,565
嘿 吉布斯 你知道毕晓普会画画吗?
Hey, Gibbs, did you know that Bishop can draw?

511
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,683
是的 她还在这里
Yeah, she's still here.

512
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:55,236
为什么?
Why?

513
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,374
好的
Okay.

514
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:02,626
艾比?
Abby?

515
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:04,611
怎么了? 是关于汇款的事情吗?
What? Is it about the money-drop?

516
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:07,748
也许我们应该谈一谈凯特的事情
Maybe we should have that talk about Kate.

517
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,637
负责人听到枪响 报警
Manager heard the shots, called the police.

518
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,256
现场没有目击证人
Nobody saw the shooter.

519
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,591
国家安全局已经支付勒索费用
NSA deposited the extortion money,

520
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:20,627
我们的间谍通过咖啡店的无线网络接收了汇款
and our spy accessed it using the coffee shop's Wi-Fi.

521
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:22,596
不是我接收一千万美金的首选场所
It's not the first place I'd come to collect $10 million.

522
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:24,465
探员弗莱德林想到同样的事情
Agent Flynderling thought the same thing.

523
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:27,301
因此他在呼叫支援之前就事先进行跟踪
That's why he came to follow up before calling in a task force.

524
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,687
三处近距离射杀 正中胸部
Three gunshot wounds to the chest at close range.

525
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,806
根据火药残留痕迹和组织损伤程度
Based on the stippling and tissue damage,

526
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:34,191
他没有任何反击机会
he never had a chance.

527
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:35,659
甚至还没有来得及下车
Barely got out of his car.

528
00:22:35,661 --> 00:22:37,111
- 伏击 - 老大
- Ambushed. - Boss,

529
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:39,246
他的口袋里面有东西
he's got something in his pocket.

530
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:49,790
嘿 老大 是不是她的...
Hey, boss, isn't this her...

531
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:57,214
我的报告
My report.

532
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:03,837
你说得对 吉布斯探员
You were right, Agent Gibbs.

533
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,607
不是这样的 毕晓普
It's not about that, Bishop.

534
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,371
有人在海军秘书官身上
Somebody plants a surveillance device

535
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,156
放置了监听设备
on the Secretary of the Navy,

536
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:27,758
并且敲诈了美国政府
and extorts the U.S. Government.

537
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,510
很可能和从华府验尸房里面偷窃
Likely the same guy who posed as an FBI agent

538
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:33,013
第二支窃听笔的冒牌探员是同一人
to steal a second spy pen from the D.C. morgue.

539
00:23:33,014 --> 00:23:34,314
鲁道夫・斯大林...
Rudolph Stalin...

540
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:35,265
他因贩卖美国情报给俄国
he's an American wanted

541
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,850
而被通缉
for selling U.S. intel to Russia.

542
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:38,318
我被他的名字和小胡子
With a name and a mustache

543
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,769
深深震撼
like that, I... I'm shocked.

544
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,154
但是当国家安全局试图付款
But when the NSA tried

545
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:42,605
并追踪汇款之时...
to pay him off and track the deposit...

546
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,324
他杀害了国家安全局的弗莱德林探员
He murdered NSA Agent Flynderling

547
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:45,992
并携款潜逃
and got away with the money.

548
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,994
事实上 我检查了海外账号
Actually, I just checked the offshore account.

549
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,662
那笔钱依旧在里面
The extortion money's still there.

550
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,564
他弃一千万美金于不顾
He left behind ten million bucks.

551
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,666
- 根本说不通 - 可能枪杀之后吓坏了吧
- That doesn't make any sense. - Could've panicked after the shooting.

552
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:55,502
也许他没有我们所想那么专业
Maybe this guy's not as professional as we thought.

553
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:56,569
或者也许
Or maybe it's not about

554
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,172
一开始就和美国政府无关
Uncle Sam's money in the first place.

555
00:23:59,174 --> 00:24:01,341
鲁道夫・斯大林可以得到什么
What... what else does Stalin get

556
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:03,910
通过引诱并杀害一个联邦探员?
by luring and killing a federal agent?

557
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,015
证明 向另外一位买家证明
Authentication. Proof to another buyer

558
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,884
他的情报属实
that his intel is genuine.

559
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,522
有人愿意支付超过一千万美金
Somebody willing to pay more than ten mil.

560
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:13,295
他在利用我们?
So he used us?

561
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,650
这个家伙在下很大的一盘棋 
This guy was playing chess,

562
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:15,469
我从来没有意识到
and I never even saw it.

563
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:19,759
我知道我应该怎么做了
I know what I have to do.

564
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,479
清零
Reset.

565
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:26,065
重新开始
I'll start over.

566
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,650
- 毕晓普 - 我可以的 这次
- Bishop. - I'll get it this time.

567
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,619
我只是需要时间清理思路而已
I just need some time to clear the chessboard.

568
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,604
毕晓普
Bishop.

569
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:32,789
休息一下
Take a break.

570
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:35,608
买杯苏打
Go get a soda.

571
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,111
没有时间 没有现金
There's no time, and I have no cash.

572
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:46,219
拿着
Take it.

573
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:50,890
怎么了 艾比?
Yeah, Abbs?

574
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:52,308
- 你能到实验室一趟吗? - 好的
- Can you come to my lab? - Yep.

575
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,965
米开朗基罗 莎士比亚 达芬奇 海明威
Michelangelo, Shakespeare, da Vinci, Hemingway.

576
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:01,267
今天你可以把我列入他们的队伍了 吉布斯
Today, you can count me amongst their ranks, Gibbs.

577
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,440
我每天都这样做的 艾比 
I do every day, Abbs.

578
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:03,319
你得到什么信息了?
What do you got?

579
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:05,521
大师级的线索
A masterpiece.

580
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:07,941
看起来好像是日期和时间而已
Well, it looks like a date and time stamp.

581
00:25:07,943 --> 00:25:10,560
有时 伟大的艺术作品往往最简单
Sometimes the greatest works of art are simple.

582
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:12,979
- 你搞定那支笔了吗? - 不 我没有
- You got into the pen? - No. I failed.

583
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:15,314
内存芯片加密极好
The internal memory chip was too well encrypted.

584
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:16,332
那么这是什么 艾比?
Then what is this, Abbs?

585
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,034
这是通过无线传感器登陆芯片
That is the last day and time

586
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:21,754
的最后日期和时间点
the chip was accessed by the Wi-Fi transmitter.

587
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:25,508
啊 这是发送端?
Ah. That the send-y part?

588
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,010
是的
Yes.

589
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:28,962
所以 我不能告诉你
So, I can't tell you

590
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:30,847
我们苦苦寻找的坏家伙究竟从里面下载了什么
what our bad guy downloaded from the pen,

591
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:32,832
但是 通过发送端
but, because of the send-y part,

592
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,350
我可以告诉你 他何时做的
I can tell you when he did it.

593
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,469
是的 昨天
Yeah. Yesterday.

594
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:37,971
下午七点二十三分
7:23 p.m.

595
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:39,973
假设海军秘书官依旧把这支笔放在
And assuming that SECNAV still had the pen

596
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:42,609
她的口袋里面... 我查看了她的时间表
in her pocket... I cross-referenced her schedule.

597
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,527
波特当时正在和她的女儿在饭店用餐
Porter was at a restaurant having dinner

598
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,479
鲁道夫・斯大林就是在此时下载的
with her teenage daughter when Stalin was downloading.

599
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,180
他需要离她多近的距离?
How close would he have to be?

600
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:51,034
非常 这是一支很小的钢笔... 天线很短
Close. It's a small pen... small antenna.

601
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:54,153
所以我检查了饭店附近街道的监控录像
So I pulled street surveillance footage from

602
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,155
发现斯大林正坐在他的车里
near the restaurant, and found Stalin sitting in his car,

603
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,074
进行贩卖情报的勾当
committing high treason.

604
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,493
我猜测 耳目无处不在确实很有帮助
I guess having eyes and ears everywhere can be helpful.

605
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:02,211
但是不要告诉毕晓普 我这样说
But don't tell Bishop I said that.

606
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:03,863
车牌号码
License plate.

607
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,165
已列为全国通缉 吉布斯
Already added to the BOLO, Gibbs.

608
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,800
我们找到这家伙的机会
Our chances of finding this guy

609
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:09,002
大大增加
just skyrocketed.

610
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:10,887
艾比 干得真好
Abbs, that's really great work.

611
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:28,488
请节哀顺变
I'm sorry for your loss.

612
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:34,160
那个被杀的探员... 是你的朋友吗?
The agent who was killed... was he a friend of yours?

613
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:37,163
更像是一个兄长
More like an older brother.

614
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,176
怎么了?
Everything okay?

615
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:52,545
不能和家人
It's tough not being able

616
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:55,348
谈论我的工作很难
to talk to my family about what I do.

617
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,801
你应该看看我告诉我的妈妈
You should've seen my mom when I told her

618
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:00,687
接受俄克拉荷马州以外的工作时 她的表情
I was taking a job outside of Oklahoma.

619
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:01,921
你为什么这么说?
Why did you?

620
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:03,756
这就是父亲
Mm. That's the difference

621
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,475
和母亲的不同
between Mom and Dad.

622
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:09,028
他的首要原则是安逸使人灭亡
His first rule is: comfort makes for complicity.

623
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,765
意为唯有挑战自我才能成长
Means the only way to grow is by challenging yourself.

624
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:15,318
这有助于让我们记住为什么选择这份工作
Well, it helps to remember why we do the job.

625
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,237
继续向前
Keeps us going.

626
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,493
我该回国家安全局了
Actually, I should get back to NSA.

627
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:25,945
想走没有那么容易
Mm. You're not getting off that easy.

628
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:27,997
吉布斯也喜欢规矩 第四十五条
Gibbs likes rules, too. Number 45:

629
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:29,782
清理干净你的烂摊子
always clean up your mess.

630
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,951
- 怎么办? - 对初学者来说
- How? - Well, for starters,

631
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:34,253
全国通缉令锁定了鲁道夫・斯大林
the BOLO came back on Rudolph Stalin.

632
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,972
我们知道他在哪里了
We know where he is.

633
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:39,726
来吧 时间不等人
Come on. Time's a-wastin'.

634
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,690
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

635
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:56,409
交警说斯大林的车
Metro PD says Stalin's car

636
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:58,578
还停在前面的一个停车场
is still parked in a lot out front.

637
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,946
他们不确定他在哪个电影院
They're not sure which theater he's in,

638
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:02,148
但是只有两家 你想让我去哪里?
but there are only two screens. Where do you want me?

639
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,482
我射击和实地训练得了满分
I aced my weapons and field training.

640
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,251
你有枪吗 爱多・安妮?
You got a gun, Ado Annie?

641
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,251
音乐剧《俄克拉荷马》中的人物

642
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:07,754
我把它落在我的流苏小马车上了
I left it in my surrey with the fringe on top.

643
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:10,006
别对我引用 俄克拉荷马
Don't quote Oklahoma to me.

644
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,426
待在车里
Stay in the car.

645
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,594
好吧
You bet.

646
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:39,652
他
Him.

647
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:41,120
是他!
That's him!

648
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,707
联邦探员!
Federal agent!

649
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,362
停下 停下 停下!
Stop, stop, stop!

650
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:01,140
毕晓普 你为什么用车撞他?
Bishop, why'd you hit him with the car?

651
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:03,893
... 其实是他撞上的车
Well... technically, he ran into the car.

652
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:07,046
必须说 这是我的直觉 不错吧?
Got to say, that was a gut move. Gut's good, right?

653
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:09,348
我们故意逼他出来的
We intentionally flushed the guy out.

654
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,766
吉布斯一直把守着出口
Gibbs had the exit covered the whole time.

655
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:11,984
什么?
What?

656
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:15,571
她使了个绝招 老大
She pulled a Palmer on this guy, boss.

657
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:21,828
至少他不会反抗了
At least he'll go quietly.

658
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:26,499
律师来之前我什么都不会说
I'm not saying anything without a lawyer.

659
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,451
你们用车撞我
You hit me with a car.

660
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:30,419
我以为他要逃脱了
I thought he was getting away.

661
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:33,906
档案上说他高中时是跑步健将
I read in his file that he was a high school track star.

662
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,409
我几乎能过目不忘
I remember almost everything I read.

663
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:42,465
不止包括一些审讯笔录
Which includes more than a few interrogation transcripts.

664
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,749
什么意思?
Meaning what?

665
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,768
我有一个主意
I have an idea.

666
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,104
等等 这些
Hang on. These.

667
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:49,188
你在做什么?
What?

668
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,389
我需要借用一下
I need to borrow this.

669
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:52,308
谢谢
Thank you.

670
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,360
审讯的主要原则
Now, a major principle of an interrogation

671
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:56,362
是让嫌疑人自己得出结论 是吧?
is to let the suspect draw their own conclusions, right?

672
00:29:56,364 --> 00:30:00,366
就是说 只要我没有说我是他的律师
Which means, as long as I never say I'm his lawyer,

673
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:03,369
只要他没有问...
as long as he never asks...

674
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:04,871
站住
Stop.

675
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,409
我能行的
I can keep up.

676
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:16,215
你撞他之前他看见你了吗?
Did that guy see you before you hit him?

677
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,000
没有
Mm-mm.

678
00:30:20,938 --> 00:30:24,307
听着 我们找了公共律师...
Look, we called the public defender...

679
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:25,558
你...
Hey. What...

680
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,726
终于来了 你是我...?
Finally. Are you my...?

681
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,477
抱歉没有换衣服
Sorry for the outfit.

682
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:30,179
今天我本该休息的 艾丽・毕晓普
Today was supposed to be my day off. Ellie Bishop.

683
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:31,264
你问他问题了吗?
Have you been asking him questions?

684
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,798
法律规定我们能
Legally, we can ask

685
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,133
想问多少问多少
as many questions as we want.

686
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:36,769
律师不在 嫌疑人是否回答取决于自己
Up to the suspect to talk without a lawyer.

687
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,304
没错 你想回答吗?
That's true. Do you want to talk?

688
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:42,408
我们不应该先私下谈谈吗? 或者...
Shouldn't we speak somewhere in private first? Or...

689
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,976
听你的 我已读过卷宗
It's up to you. I mean, I've read the file,

690
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,528
他们掌握了谋杀案件的充分证据
and they do have a pretty solid murder case.

691
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,197
- 谋杀案件? - 是的 一位联邦探员
- Murder? - Yeah. Of a federal agent.

692
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:50,166
不可能 我... 我没有杀任何人
No way. I... I didn't kill anybody.

693
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:52,251
他们知道了海军秘书官身上的笔有蹊跷
They know about the pen on the Secretary of the Navy.

694
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:54,170
知道了你出现在餐馆
They know that you were at the restaurant,

695
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:55,621
知道了一千万美元的事情
and they know about the $10 million.

696
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:57,156
不过你还能自救
You can help yourself, though.

697
00:30:57,158 --> 00:30:58,424
如果你承认谋杀
If you cop to the murder,

698
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,793
- 可能能减刑 - 我没有杀任何人!
- might reduce sentencing. - I didn't kill anybody!

699
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:02,795
你对一名联邦探员胸部开了三枪!
You shot a federal agent three times in the chest!

700
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:04,263
冷静一下
Hey! Take it down a peg.

701
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:06,098
他说他没有杀任何人 好吗?
He said he didn't kill anybody, okay?

702
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,267
- 先听他怎么说 - 然后你行动迅速
- Let's hear him out. - Then you make it fast.

703
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,519
我没有勒索政府
I did not extort the government,

704
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:13,055
也没有杀这个探员
and I did not kill this agent.

705
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:14,890
但是我知道是谁干的
But I know who did.

706
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:17,310
- 名字 - 爱德华・格瑞斯
- Name. - Edward Gracy.

707
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:18,694
他以前向我卖过情报
He's sold me info before.

708
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:20,363
公司的技术机密
Corporate stuff at tech secrets.

709
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,848
这是他第一次提供政府情报
This is the first time he's offered government intel.

710
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,116
这么说你承认了叛国罪
So you're admitting to treason.

711
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,568
我们应该相信吗?
We supposed to believe this?

712
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,954
我不知道是否应该信他
I don't know if I believe him at all.

713
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:30,122
需要一个地址来证明
Need an address to prove it.

714
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:42,385
给你
Here you go.

715
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:55,046
那我的好处呢?
Hey, what about my deal?

716
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,733
你应该和你的律师谈谈
Oh, you'll have to take that up with your lawyer.

717
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:57,984
你说你是我的律师
You said you were my lawyer.

718
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,219
我没有说 给你我的名片了
No, I didn't. Gave you my card.

719
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,998
这在法庭上能用吗?
Is that gonna hold up in court?

720
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,033
不知道 我也不是律师
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer, either.

721
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:17,536
好的 得到市中心一家办公室的确认
All right, got confirmation on a downtown office,

722
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,206
以爱德华・格瑞斯的名字登记租用
rent in the name Edward Gracy.

723
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:22,041
我通知了交警 他们已经待命
I alerted Metro PD, and they're on standby.

724
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:23,426
已经适应了你的节奏了
Getting used to your pace here.

725
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:24,593
那你需要穿上这个
Well, then you're gonna need this.

726
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:30,766
这... 这是旧的吗?
Uh... h-has this been used?

727
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:35,254
毕晓普
Bishop.

728
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:38,107
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

729
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:39,642
当然
Of course.

730
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:41,760
是...是的
Y... Yes.

731
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:43,095
是的 马上就到
Yes, right away.

732
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:44,647
- 怎么了? - 交警那边有问题吗?
- What's the matter? - There a problem with Metro?

733
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:46,399
不 是国家安全局的上司
No. Uh, it was my boss at NSA.

734
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:49,235
他们让我立刻回总部报告
They need me back at HQ to debrief immediately.

735
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,703
该出发了
Got to go.

736
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,623
联邦探员!
Federal agents!

737
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,379
爱德华・格瑞斯!
Edward Gracy!

738
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,263
没有人在家
Nobody's home.

739
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,365
你怎么想? 咱们又被耍了吗?
What do you think? We being played again?

740
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,617
检查一下桌子
Check the desk.

741
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,125
只有垃圾邮件
Nothing here but junk mail,

742
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,244
全球通的过期刊物
back issues of GSM.

743
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,380
收件人都是爱德华・格瑞斯
They're all addressed here to Edward Gracy.

744
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,304
这是我们的国际象棋大师
This is our master chess player?

745
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:08,311
老大 我在这里有发现
Boss, I got something back here.

746
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,764
这绝对是格瑞斯制作窃听器的地方
Well, this is definitely where Gracy makes his bugs,

747
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,652
很明显他还关注心脏病
and apparently raises awareness about heart disease, as well.

748
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,769
慈善邮递员?
Charity mailers?

749
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,571
- 我们的杀手有良知? - 不
- Our killer has a conscience? - Nope.

750
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,073
他的目标有
His targets do.

751
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:23,409
这里有一张寄给萨拉・波特的海运邮寄单回执
Shipping receipt for a mailer sent to Sarah Porter.

752
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:24,644
美国海军秘书官 他将窃听器
SECNAV. He's sending the bugs

753
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,862
他在宣传小册子里附赠了窃听器
with the brochures.

754
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,480
就像垃圾邮件里赠的免费礼物一样
Junk mail free gifts.

755
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,648
你没有收到回信地址的标签
Instead of return-address labels,

756
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,416
反而意外收到了一只超级间谍笔
you get a super spy pen?

757
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,918
这么做风险大 又没有保障
It's a big risk with no guarantee.

758
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,719
一不小心就当废品扔掉了 
It's gonna make it past your junk drawer,

759
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,986
哪里能逃得过多重威胁预警中心的法眼呢?
let alone MTAC.

760
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,371
他的收据真多
This is full of receipts.

761
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,840
好像他一天二十四小时不停地发邮件
He sends them out like clockwork.

762
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,846
收据都是从同一邮局开出的
These are all from the same post office.

763
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,571
喂?
Hello.

764
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,940
你来这里做什么?
What the hell are you doing here?

765
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,242
这个...
Uh...

766
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,501
好吧 请听我解释
Okay, I can explain.

767
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:57,050
我一直在找和爱德华・格瑞斯
I kept digging into the name

768
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:58,121
这个名字有关的信息
Edward Gracy.

769
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,872
我觉得自己... 简直欲罢不能了
I just... I couldn't help myself.

770
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,708
给我回车里去
Get back in your car.

771
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,960
好的 听我说 格瑞斯这个姓氏是一个化名
Okay, but wait. Th-The name Gracy is an alias,

772
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,462
还有 我发现有个信用卡账户每周都会...
and I found an open credit card with weekly purchases...

773
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,117
毕晓普! 
Bishop!

774
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,798
...来这间邮局买东西 知道吗?
...a-at this post office, okay?

775
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,082
我... 来这里
I... I came here

776
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,184
是想找找线索
to follow up.

777
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,019
格瑞斯的邮筒就在这间店里
Gracy's P.O. box is inside the store.

778
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,854
这我知道! 关键是他本人也在里面
I know! So is he.

779
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:16,389
这话我一直想说来着
It's what I'm trying to tell you.

780
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:19,859
哦
Oh.

781
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,428
看来你一直跟着他
You're on a stakeout.

782
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,449
- 老大? - 毕晓普!
- Boss? - Bishop!

783
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,103
快去!
Go!

784
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:51,791
不是吧 擒拿罪犯这你也行啊?
What, did you read a book on disarming bad guys?

785
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,126
跟我的三个哥哥学的 你别动!
Three older brothers. Quit squirming!

786
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,428
这把枪应该
I think we'll find this weapon's

787
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,430
和杀了弗莱林的那只相符
a match to the one that killed Flynn.

788
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,067
交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

789
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:02,185
- 你可以吗? - 当然
- You got it? - Yeah.

790
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,186
好的
All right.

791
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,638
我们走吧 大块头
Here we go, big guy.

792
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,751
怎么了?
What?

793
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,422
我们都是正确的
We were both right.

794
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,507
还把他抓到了
And we got him.

795
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:27,510
看来你还没有明白 毕晓普
You're still missing the point, Bishop.

796
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,055
找到指纹的匹配对象了
Got a hit on the fingerprint.

797
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,475
他的真名叫赛迪斯・诺克斯
Real name is Thaddeus Knox.

798
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,676
因其在企业做间谍 多次被捕
Multiple arrests for corporate espionage.

799
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,478
他现在又多了叛国和杀人两项罪名了
Now we can add treason and murder.

800
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,710
这完全没道理啊 
It doesn't make any sense.

801
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,064
又怎么啦 大明星?
What now, Russell Crowe?

802
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,232
还嫌你今天
Hasn't your beautiful mind

803
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,734
惹得麻烦不够多吗?
gotten you in enough trouble today?

804
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,953
听着 我不查明真相决不罢休 我发现这个
Look, I don't quit until I get it right, and our corporate

805
00:37:52,955 --> 00:37:54,821
小子和整件事毫无关联
pretty boy just doesn't fit into the big picture.

806
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:56,512
国家安全局和海军罪案调查处 
We've never seen him

807
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,357
都没有他的记录
NSA or NCIS.

808
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,025
- 看来他是新手 - 没错
- He's a first-timer. - Exactly.

809
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,877
如果他只想通过给技术员工发窃听器
But if he sends bugs to tech employees

810
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,470
来获取企业机密的话 
looking for corporate secrets,

811
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,381
为何要找上海军秘书官呢?
why make the jump to SECNAV

812
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:07,384
这是犯罪行为 会让他终身监禁的
and a crime that carries out a life sentence?

813
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,868
他大打出手肯定有原因
Something made him leave his comfort zone.

814
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,704
这和观念以及权力都没有关系 而是...
It's not about ideology or power, it's...

815
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,640
而是他想挑战自己
it's about challenging himself,

816
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:15,541
证明自己的能力
proving that he can do the job.

817
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,593
他想引起谁的注意呢?
Who's he trying to impress?

818
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,812
他的上司
His boss.

819
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,773
好啦 好啦 找到啦 
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

820
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,568
难道这些成堆的收据上面有我们想要的答案?
Don't tell me those crazy papers are finally paying off.

821
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,739
- 毕晓普... - 我今早拿到了
- Bishop... - I have staff lists

822
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,758
多重威胁预警中心下属企业的员工名单
from the corporations in MTAC this morning.

823
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,028
除了一家企业 其他所有企业的每个员工
Bugs have been sent to employees of every company

824
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:51,911
都收到了窃听器
except one.

825
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,485
这家企业就是格瑞斯所在的... 
The same company that's paying Gracy.

826
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:54,097
贝灵哲海运
Beringer Marine.

827
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,581
他们和海军秘书官有什么过节吗?
What do they have against SECNAV?

828
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:04,307
吉布斯探员
Agent Gibbs.

829
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,592
你来拿更新资料的吗?
You here for the update?

830
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,650
出什么事了吗?
What's going on?

831
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:14,985
要是我知道就好了
Hell if I know.

832
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:17,070
秘书官女士让我别管她的事情
Madam Secretary's cut me out of the loop.

833
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,440
是的 我也注意到了
Yeah. I couldn't help but notice

834
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,492
你们俩之前关系挺紧张的
the tension between you two earlier.

835
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,128
我并不介意听命于人
You know, I don't mind taking orders.

836
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,615
但是我希望命令来自于海军人员
I'd prefer they come from fellow Marines,

837
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,967
或者是曾经当过海军的人
or someone who's served.

838
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,335
我明白
I hear you.

839
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,504
让一个平民去下令 并让成千上万的
A civilian giving orders that affects thousands

840
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,790
军事人员服从于他 对于这种事情我最愤怒了
of military personnel pisses me off more than you know.

841
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,509
几个月前
Few months back,

842
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,062
我被提名为海军秘书官候选人之一
I was on the short list for the SECNAV appointment.

843
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,683
我觉得很光荣 但是我没有接受这个重担
I was honored, but didn't feel right about it.

844
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,601
为什么呢?
Why?

845
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,820
- 你挺合适的 - 也许吧
- You seem qualified. - Maybe.

846
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,323
但是我没有参过军
But I haven't served in uniform.

847
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:55,525
而我是十分尊重军人的
And I have too much respect for those who have.

848
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,809
比如说你
Like you.

849
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,194
波特自以为
It's not right

850
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,480
什么都懂 但是事实并非如此
for Porter to pretend she knows what they need.

851
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,998
她应该像我一样 做出正确的选择
She should've done the right thing, like I did,

852
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,333
拒绝参选海军秘书官一职的
and declined the position.

853
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,418
但是...
But...

854
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,203
她现在不得不拒绝此项殊荣了
I guess she'll have to now.

855
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,593
这是什么?
What is this?

856
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:15,545
国家安全局的窃听器
A bug at the NSA.

857
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,680
真是意想不到啊
Who would've thought?

858
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,682
你背叛了我 长官?
You turn on me, Marine?

859
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,684
这里唯一的叛徒就是你 沃德
The only turncoat here is you, Ward.

860
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,552
你雇了企业间谍让我在众人面前
By hiring one of your corporate spies

861
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,138
下不了台 你还让整个国家陷于危险之中
to embarrass me, you put the entire country at risk.

862
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,940
我和你说的事情毫无关系
I had nothing to do with that.

863
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:28,358
我只想保护我的国家
I only want to protect this country

864
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,842
以及捍卫国家安全的人
and the people defending it.

865
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,780
我没有参过军 但是我懂得责任
I may not have served, but I know about duty

866
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,281
与牺牲的重要性
and sacrifice.

867
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,403
不是穿上制服就能组个队的
Takes more than a uniform to make a team.

868
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,416
吉布斯探员?
Agent Gibbs?

869
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,219
托尼和麦基告诉我你在这里
Tony and McGee said you'd still be here.

870
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,054
是的
I am.

871
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,591
这么晚了还打搅你... 我很抱歉
Sorry to... bother you so late.

872
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,676
永远别说道歉
Never say you're sorry.

873
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,845
这只能说明你的软弱
It is a sign of weakness.

874
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:09,482
今天发生了那件事情之后
I thought that was the point.

875
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:12,769
我以为这就是你想听的
Especially after today.

876
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:15,739
但是我觉得我最终还是想清楚了
But I think I've finally figured something out.

877
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,191
你真是个寻根究底的人啊 毕晓普?
You always got to have the right answer, don't you, Bishop?

878
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,245
是的
Unfortunately.

879
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,559
如果你愿意听我说完 
But if you'll let me finish,

880
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,398
我可以解释为什么我的想法错了
I can explain why that's wrong.

881
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:34,457
我工作很努力
I work hard.

882
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:38,044
哪里跌倒 就在哪里爬起
And when I fall, I get right back up.

883
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:41,080
我很聪明 我希望自己能出一份力
I'm smart, a-and I want to make a difference.

884
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:46,052
这我可以做得到
And I can.

885
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:50,473
我太执着于... 做自己了
Been so busy looking at the... the chessboard on my own,

886
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,810
却遗忘了整个团队
I... I forgot to be a part of it.

887
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,814
我之前并不懂得团队合作
I wasn't a team player.

888
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,767
嗯...
So...

889
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,453
我想说的... 就是这些了
that... that's... that's what I wanted to say.

890
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:04,737
没有其他了
That's it.

891
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:06,239
嗯 晚安
Um, good night.

892
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:07,991
还是说... 祝你好运吧
Or good... good luck.

893
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:10,493
算了吧
Never mind.

894
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,545
你有东西忘了拿
You forgot something.

895
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:19,452
哦 那不是我的
Uh, that's not mine.

896
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,770
上面写着你的名字
It's got your name on it.

897
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,494
这是我几年之前给海军罪案调查处
This is my NCIS application

898
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:34,400
发的个人简历
from years ago.

899
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,438
后来我去国家安全局工作了
Before I took the job at NSA.

900
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,989
这件事情你怎么知道的?
How did you know about this?

901
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:42,408
你的名字听着很熟悉 我回去查了查
Your name sounded familiar; I went back and looked it up.

902
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,410
所以你今天才带我去查案?
That's why you brought me along today.

903
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,146
看来你也是不喜欢合作的人
You play chess, too.

904
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,252
我只想看看你是否还愿意接受挑战
I wanted to see if you were still up for a challenge.

905
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:54,170
为什么?
Why?

906
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,875
我想把你留下来
I'd like to keep you around.

907
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:00,793
学习学习共同责任
Joint duty assignment.

908
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:03,630
什么?
What?
