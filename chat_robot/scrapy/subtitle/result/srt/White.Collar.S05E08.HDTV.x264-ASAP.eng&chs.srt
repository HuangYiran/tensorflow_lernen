Mosconi法典
The Mosconi Codex.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,560
你要帮我偷回来
You're gonna steal it for me.

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,830
何时才结束?
When does it end?

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,830
你把流血不止的他留在了人行道上
You left him bleeding on the sidewalk.

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,330
我没杀那家伙
I didn't kill the dude.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,430
我拿了他的证件 把枪丢进了垃圾桶 我发誓
I pulled that badge and gun out of the trash, I swear.

8
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,830
Summers告诉我们把两百万美金藏在哪了
Summers told us where she hid the $2 million,

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,360
但却找不到
but it wasn't there.

10
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,500
- 推拿诊疗室?  - 看上去有模有样
- A chiropractor's office?  - It'll look the part.

11
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,300
我是Gruetzner探员 恭候多时
Agent Gruetzner. We've been expecting you.

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,030
有什么原因吸引他来这吗?
Any reason he'd slip away to come here?

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,400
Neal来一定是有原因的
Neal always has a reason.

14
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,560
如果这本书是一副拼图
If this book is a puzzle,

15
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,130
这些可能是拼块
maybe these are the pieces.

16
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,360
这个彩绘玻璃窗
This stained glass window

17
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,160
肯定就在曼哈顿
could be right here in Manhattan.

18
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,360
Neal就站在这
This is where Neal was standing.

19
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,500
根据他的脚铐记录
For 20 minutes,

20
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,660
20分钟后
after which he went straight home,

21
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,460
他就直接回家了
according to his anklet.

22
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,360
从这个十字路口 你可以监视到一个博物馆
From this intersection, you could scout a museum,

23
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,460
两个银行 一个画廊
two banks, and a gallery,

24
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,830
更别说其它住宅区了
not to mention all the residential targets.

25
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,060
Peter 我打电话问过了
Peter, I made some calls.

26
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,900
没有可疑现象上报过来
There was no suspicious activity reported.

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
Neal Caffrey在这就够可疑的了
Not unless you count Neal Caffrey being here.

28
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,930
你觉得是我反应过度吗?
You think I'm overreacting?

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
不 我只是觉得我们也许可以考虑
No, I just think we might consider the possibility

30
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,930
Caffrey只是去买点东西的可能性
that Caffrey was just picking up some groceries.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,800
为了买面包 这也未免太远了
Long walk for a loaf of bread.

32
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,430
好吧
Okay.

33
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,260
那他在那里干嘛?
So what was he doing there?

34
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,030
首先 有失踪的现金
First, there was the missing cash,

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,130
然后在推拿诊疗室找到一支联邦调查局的笔
then the FBI pen at the chiropractor's office,

36
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,730
现在是这个街角
and now this street corner.

37
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,100
那你认为全部加起来的结果是?
So what do you think it all adds up to?

38
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,260
这就是问题
That's the problem.

39
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,530
我找不到关联点
I can't see how it all connects.

40
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,460
还缺点什么线索
I'm missing something.

41
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,300
看看这个地方的监控录像有没有拍到什么
See if any cameras in the area picked up anything.

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,930
好的
Will do.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,930
听着 我也查了下
Listen, I also ran the card

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,660
你在Siegel证件里找到的卡片
that you found in Siegel's badge.

45
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,230
跟房地产公司谈过
Talked to the real estate company.

46
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,160
没人知道"cooper 3?"是什么
No one knew what "cooper 3?" meant.

47
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,460
我查过了Siegel的旧案件夹
I looked through Siegel's old case files,

48
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,530
以及在芝加哥的朋友 家人
friends and family back in Chicago.

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,100
天啊 我甚至谷歌过了
Hell, I even looked on google.

50
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,860
都没找到线索 抱歉
No hits. Sorry.

51
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,560
听着 我实在不想开口问这个
Listen, I hate to ask you this,

52
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,330
你认为Caffrey没有完全告诉我们
but you don't think Caffrey knows anything

53
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,960
他知道的事情 对吧?
that he's not telling us, do you?

54
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,530
- 关于Siegel的事?  - 对
- About Siegel?  - Yeah.

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,300
- 是的  - 好吧 
- I don't.  - All right.

56
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,760
查过黑市的暗号
Checked black market code words,

57
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,360
不同的地方 线人名字
drop locations, C.I. names.

58
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,600
Mozzie甚至把它和劫机大盗联系起来了 
Mozzie even tried to tie it to D. B. Cooper.

59
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,100
还是没查到
Nothing.

60
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,560
可能是一个联邦调查局探员的救命稻草
Maybe it's an FBI agent grasping at straws.

61
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,930
嘿
Hey.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,300
我们都知道你的直觉很少会错
We both know your instincts are rarely wrong.

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,660
目前我们有个被窃的运货箱
Well, for now, we've got a stolen shipping crate

64
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,700
要高度重视
that demands our attention.

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,200
一个诈骗汽车货运公司今天早上
Grabbed from Canadian customs this morning

66
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,100
从加拿大海关拿过来的
by a fraudulent trucking company.

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,430
司机跑掉了 还没找到他
The driver ran. No sign of him yet.

68
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,730
肯定是一些加拿大走私货
Must be some exotic Canadian contraband

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,130
好让你走出办公室
to get you out of the office.

70
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
那可值得我伸展拳脚
Oh, this is well worth a stretch of my legs.

71
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,800
别告诉我
Don't tell me.

72
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,100
是来自西北地区
It's diamonds from the Diavik Mine

73
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,600
戴维科钻石矿场的钻石
in the northwest territories.

74
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,460
可能是枫蜜呢
Maybe it's maple syrup.

75
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,630
你说笑吧 加拿大枫糖浆抢劫大案
You joke, but the great Canadian maple syrup heist

76
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,230
值1800万呢
was worth 18 million.

77
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,730
那要找大点的箱了
You'd need a bigger crate though.

78
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
需要很多薄饼
And a lot of pancakes.

79
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,800
我是特别探员Burke 开箱吧
Special Agent Burke. Go ahead.

80
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,660
好像圣诞节的早上
It's like Christmas morning.

81
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,730
不 这不是礼物 是赃物
No, it's not a gift. This is stolen property.

82
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,530
我知道这条界限对你来说模糊
I know the line gets blurry for you.

83
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
根据箱子的大小和原产国
Based on the size of the box and the country of origin,

84
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,160
我的最佳猜测是Emanuel Hahnd的雕塑品
my best guess is a sculpture from Emanuel Hahn,

85
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,360
加拿大艺术家 大约在1918年
Canadian artist, circa 1918.

86
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,460
这比圣诞节礼物还牛
Oh, this is better than Christmas.

87
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,060
是枚恐龙蛋
This is a dinosaur egg.

88
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,460
到现在了你还有点想看它裂开 对吧?
Even now you kind of expect it to crack open, don't you?

89
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,330
我真不想
I really don't.

90
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,960
一颗化石蛋竟然没有引起你的幻想?
A fossilized egg doesn't capture your imagination?

91
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,030
它的价值倒是引起了
Well, the value of it does.

92
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,030
你好? 打扰下
Hello? Excuse me.

93
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,730
我是Khatri博士
I'm Dr.Khatri.

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,260
我是自然历史博物馆的馆长之一
I'm one of the curators of the natural history museum.

95
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,760
我是Peter Burke探员
Agent Peter Burke.

96
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,760
就是你帮我找回了恐龙蛋
You're the one who found my egg.

97
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,830
也不是他一个人的功劳
Well, he can't take all the credit.

98
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,500
它的母亲在哪?
And where's the mother?

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,760
什么意思?
What do you mean?

100
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,730
那个母亲装在另一只箱子里
There was a second shipment containing the mother.

101
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
什么母亲?
What kind of mother?

102
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,000
一只霸王龙
A Tyrannosaurus Rex.

103
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,500
你是说有一只霸王龙
You're saying there's a Tyrannosaurus Rex

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,360
在纽约失踪了?
lost somewhere in New York city?

105

妙警贼探 第五季第8集

108
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,930
霸王龙被同时用另一辆货车
Tyrannosaurus Rex was being shipped simultaneously

109
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,260
运过来了
on a different truck.

110
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,560
找不到在哪儿
No sign of it anywhere.

111
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,330
追捕一只霸王龙啊
Hunting a T-Rex.

112
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,300
如果是7岁的我 一定会高兴疯了
Seven-year-old me would be going crazy.

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
长大成人的你也不是很淡定啊
Adult you isn't exactly serene.

114
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,400
我迫不及待想亲眼看到它
I can't wait to see it in person

115
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,330
和它的蛋团聚
when it's reunited with its egg.

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Mozzie以前经常做假的化石
Mozzie used to create fake fossils

117
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,860
然后埋到考古挖掘场
and bury them at dig sites.

118
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,500
以前经常?
Used to?

119
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,960
几个月之前的事了
It's been a couple months.

120
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,200
Mozzie创造了地球的历史
The alternate history of the earth according to Mozzie.

121
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,760
太可怕了
That's terrifying.

122
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,430
我是说 黑市上的假化石
I'm just saying, the black market is rife

123
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,930
俯拾皆是
with fake fossils like this.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
我们知道这个蛋是真的吗?
Do we know the egg is real?

125
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,360
Khatri做了一个重要的测试 而且已经验证了

126
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,700
那些超级有钱 但是不够精明的人

127
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,930
就喜欢放在他们的办公室
do love to put them in their office

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,430
炫耀权力
as a display of power.

129
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,200
对 有什么比一只霸王龙和它的蛋更牛吗?
Yeah, what bigger display than a T-Rex and its egg?

130
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,700
无论买方是谁
Whoever the buyer is,

131
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,400
他们肯定会要整套的
it's clear they want the entire set.

132
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,160
单独一个很珍贵 一起就是无价之宝了
Valuable alone, invaluable together.

133
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,930
就像玛丽女王的钻石项链
It's like having Queen Mary's diamond riviere

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,230
没有了漫游者珍珠
without the la peregrine pearl.

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,100
我回家放松下
I'm just gonna relax at home.

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,030
随便读点书
Do a little light reading.

139
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,860
嘿
Hey.

140
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,660
很开心你打给我了
I'm really happy that you called.

141
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,500
我发现了点东西 也带来了点东西
I found something, and I brought something.

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
是啊 我该早点跟你说...
Yeah, I should've mentioned...

143
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,700
Gruetzner探员会和我们一起
Agent Gruetzner will be joining us.

144
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,260
你好
Hello.

145
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,860
珍本书专家和红酒专家
A rare book expert and a wine connoisseur.

146
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,300
是加州津芬德尔葡萄酒
Oh, California zin.

147
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,100
还真是技多不压身
Well, there's no shame in having one specialty.

148
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,200
你说发现了什么?
You said you found something?

149
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,930
对
Uh, yes.

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,530
对 我发现了点东西
Yes, I did.

151
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,560
我在调查彩绘玻璃窗的时候
So I was looking into the stained glass window,

152
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,730
无意中发现了这个
and I stumbled across this.

153
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,230
哇
Oh, wow.

154
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,500
那是Mosconi的墓地
Oh! Mosconi's grave site.

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
对
Uh, yes.

156
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,560
看看墓碑底部
Just look down here at the bottom.

157
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,060
是一个共济会的指南针
It's a masonic compass.

158
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,530
所以他是一个共济会会员
So he was a mason.

159
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,900
我早就该发现这点
I should have noticed it sooner.

160
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,730
这就是为什么他把第13章放到
I mean, this is why he put the Chapter 13

161
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,300
法典里
into the codex.

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,900
13被认为是手足情谊的神圣数字
13 is considered a sacred number for the brotherhood.

163
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,930
他在向其他共济会会员传达信息
He was sending a message to the other masons.

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
法典可以指引我们了解任何事情
The codex could lead us anywhere.

165
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,660
共济会会员手上什么都有
I mean, masons have their hands in everything.

166
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,600
财政 政府 艺术
Finance, government, art.

167
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,260
英年早逝
Untimely death.

168
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,400
看墓碑上的日期
Look at the date on the gravestone.

169
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,600
1887年4月17日
April 17, 1887.

170
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,260
他也是在那个月画完玻璃窗的
That's the same month he finished the window.

171
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,500
那肯定是他最后的作品
That must have been his final work.

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,760
你认为他之所以被杀
Do you think that he was killed

173
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,860
是因为这些吗?
because of all of this?

174
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,100
如果是的话
If that's so,

175
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,260
彩绘玻璃窗就能告诉我们原因了
the stained glass could tell us why.

176
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,000
谢谢提供这些信息 我们会从这里着手
Well, thanks for everything. We'll take it from here.

177
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
噢
Oh.

178
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,300
好的 你们接手吧
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

179
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,300
好 谢谢你过来 还带了红酒
Yes, thank you for coming over and for the wine.

180
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,760
别客气
Sure.

181
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,630
愿意周三和我吃晚饭吗?
Dinner on Wednesday without the chaperone?

182
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,330
我愿意奉陪 Gaffrey探员
Of course, Agent Gaffrey.

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,260
期待和你合作
I look forward to working with you more

184
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,460
调查整个案件
on all of this.

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,000
什么?
What?

186
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,860
完全在我的掌控下
I got it under control.

187
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,860
我不想说显而易见的事情
Well, I hate to report the obvious news,

188
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,300
但你现在一点也不掌控自如
but the last thing you are right now is under control.

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
幸好你有个守护天使
Luckily, you have a guardian angel

190
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,530
眷顾着你
looking over you.

191
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,930
这不像天使做的事 更像跟踪狂
This is less angel and more stalker.

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,260
我查过她的底了
I vetted her,

193
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,560
粗略查了一下
a cursory audit.

194
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,700
资金 教育背景 日程安排
Financials, education, daily schedule.

195
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,400
她日程安排紧凑 会讲三种语言
She keeps a tight routine, speaks three languages,

196
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,330
在法国留学了两年
studied two years in France.

197
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,260
拿着这个 以防万一
Here, just keep it. Just in case.

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,900
霸王龙和她的蛋被一个住在多伦多的人
T-Rex and her egg were owned legally

199
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,630
合法拥有50年了
by a man in Toronto for 50 years.

200
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,760
直到三个月前他去世
He kept it in his family room

201
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,260
一直存放在他家里的休息室
until he died three months ago.

202
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,100
那可是会吃掉小孩的恐怖宠物
That's a hell of a pet to get your kids.

203
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,230
要多大的铲子来清理粪便啊
Big pooper scooper.

204
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,460
他口述过 去世之后
He dictated that, upon his death,

205
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,960
就捐给博物馆
it be donated to the museum.

206
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,560
我猜有人会说服中介
I'm guessing someone tried to persuade the estate

207
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,960
把它们卖掉
to sell it instead.

208
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,530
这样的人多着呢
Lots of someones.

209
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,900
都有哪些嫌疑人?
Who do we like?

210
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,100
有非常多的人
Well, there's a number of people

211
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,330
都很想收购它
who pursued it very aggressively.

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,700
竞价越来越高
Lots of escalating offers.

213
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,500
还有很多可疑分子去扰乱人心
And a lot of suspicious people making them.

214
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,860
有谁只出场过一回吗?
Anyone only try once?

215
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,000
有两个人只竞价过一次
Yeah, there were two single bids.

216
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,300
其中一个人出价很低
I mean, one was a lowball offer,

217
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,700
而另一个人
but then there's this guy.

218
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,600
他首次出价就比所有人都高
He made a single high-priced offer, then nothing.

219
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,130
Brett Forsyth 专门收购公司
Brett Forsythe, corporate raider,

220
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,960
通过恶意收购赚了几千万
made millions from hostile takeovers.

221
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,330
我听说过他
I've heard of him.

222
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,260
他去年带头收购了一家叫Aegis的公司
He led a takeover of a company called Aegis last year.

223
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,500
他是那种
That's the kind of guy

224
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,030
明知道别人不会卖
who knows when someone's not gonna sell,

225
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,060
还是会不择手段达到目的的人
and his only option is to take what he wants.

226
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,900
我要去会会他
I'm gonna pay him a visit.

227
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,300
不好意思 Forsythe先生现在不见客
I'm sorry, Mr. Forsythe is unavailable at the moment.

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,500
好吧
Of course he is.

229
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,060
那你就告诉他
Well, if you could tell him

230
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,000
联邦调查局精英调查小组的
that Agent Burke of the FBI,

231
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,430
Burke探员来访
White Collar Division,

232
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,300
想和他聊两句
would like to speak with him.

233
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,560
多久我都会等的
I can wait here as long as it takes.

234
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,200
反正有他们俩陪我
I'm sure these guys would love to keep me company.

235
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,130
很可能是她老板
That's probably her boss

236
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,030
说他可以见我了
telling her that I can see him now.

237
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,500
你接手Aegis公司的时候
When you took over Aegis,

238
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,660
董事会还不知道你要夺走他们的公司
the board didn't know you'd stolen their company

239
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,460
直到你走进会议事
until you walked through the door

240
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,830
宣布他们都被解雇了
and fired all of them.

241
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,960
那是我的合法权益 Burke探员
That was my legal right, Agent Burke.

242
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,460
是的
It was.

243
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,460
那后你就把公司拆分成一块一块地卖出去
And then you sold off pieces of the company one by one,

244
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,060
获得了一大笔利益
made a great profit.

245
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,930
很多人丢了工作
Lost a lot of jobs.

246
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,860
一个月前政府因为Aegis接管案已经找我问过话了
The feds questioned me about the Aegis takeover a month ago.

247
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,600
那件事完全合法
It was all aboveboard.

248
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,060
我知道
I know.

249
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,430
那你来是为了什么?
Why are you here?

250
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,830
那是迅猛龙的头骨吗?
Is that a velociraptor skull?

251
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,200
是的
Yeah.

252
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,760
我应该卖掉它
I should sell it.

253
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,230
因为侏罗纪公园
Thanks to Jurassic Park,

254
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,360
每个人都变成了恐龙爱好者
everyone thinks they're an expert on them.

255
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,400
但是那部电影里有很多错误
Except the movie got everything wrong.

256
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,900
迅猛龙很可能
Velociraptors were

257
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,700
是有羽毛的
most likely feathered,

258
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
因为古生物学家
based on the quill knobs

259
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,260
在它们身上发现了羽茎瘤
found by paleontologists.

260
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,400
而且电影把它们塑造得太大了
And the film made them much larger,

261
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,160
应该和恐爪龙的大小差不多
more like the size of a deinonychus.

262
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,500
没错
That's true.

263
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,400
迅猛龙其实和小鸡的大小差不多
Velociraptors were closer to the size of a chicken.

264
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,500
而且是长得很凶的小鸡
Still, one mean-looking chicken.

265
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,700
它们很危险
And very dangerous.

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,630
你也喜欢收藏?
Are you a collector?

267
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,400
就用政府给我的那点工资?
Oh, on a government salary?

268
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,760
连一个踝关节骨都买不起
I'd barely be able to afford an ankle joint.

269
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,000
你怎么得到它的?
How'd you get it?

270
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,900
有很多合法渠道可以买到化石
There are many legal ways to purchase fossils, Agent.

271
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,460
是的
True.

272
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,560
也有很多不合法的渠道
Many illegal ways as well.

273
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,060
这就是你来这里的原因?
That why you're here?

274
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,060
调查我的迅猛龙化石是否是合法取得的?
To question the legality of my velociraptor?

275
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,300
不 我要找的是个更大的家伙
No, I'm hunting something bigger.

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
霸王龙
A T-Rex.

277
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,630
你不是说你不喜欢收藏
Thought you said you weren't a collector.

278
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
不是我要找
It's not for me.

279
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,600
它本来应该在博物馆的
It was supposed to go to a museum

280
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,430
但现在却不见了
but didn't make it there.

281
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,400
Burke探员 退一万步说
Agent Burke, even if I stole a tyrannosaurus rex,

282
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,760
假设是我偷了霸王龙
which I did not,

283
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,700
我要它干嘛用呢?
what would I do with it?

284
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,160
我又不能把它摆在这里当装饰
It's not like I could just put it on display.

285
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,160
有道理
That's a good point.

286
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,400
但它还是很值得拥有的
But what a thing to have.

287
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,060
你认为他在自家衣柜里藏了一副骨架?
You think he has an actual skeleton in his closet?

288
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,500
我不知道那里藏了什么
I don't know what he's hiding in there,

289
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
但是龙头骨下面
but there was a large open space

290
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,500
确实有一大块空地方
right underneath the raptor skull.

291
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,200
你去的时候 他拖延了时间
Well, he stalled when you got there.

292
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,360
其实是在搬东西
That gave him time to move it.

293
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,060
很可能是违法的东西
So chances are it's illegal.

294
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,530
我敲门的时候
Is that what takes you so long

295
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,900
你需要那么长时间开门吗?
to come to the door when I knock?

296
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,100
你觉得我往床下藏违法的东西?
You think I'm hiding illicit goods under my bed?

297
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,460
你肯定是在藏着什么
I think you're hiding something.

298
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,000
但我没有足够的证据
But I don't have enough for a warrant

299
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,260
申请搜查Forsythe的办公室
to search Forsythe's office.

300
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,660
那你就等着瞧 看看有没有发现
You should stake it out, see what happens.

301
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,530
特别是晚上六点的时候
Especially around 6:00 p.m.

302
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,230
任何可疑情况我都会注意的
I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious.

303
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,730
你说的空地方是在恐龙头骨下面?
You said the empty space was near the raptor skull?

304
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
嗯 正下方
Yeah, right underneath.

305
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,400
现在里面有东西了
It's not empty anymore.

306
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,800
是一个长得很丑的大棒子
Now there's a mean-looking club there.

307
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,030
像是前哥伦布时期的
Looks pre-Columbian.

308
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,760
Forsythe一定是在我离开之后放回去的
Forsythe must have moved it back after I left.

309
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,700
既然都来了
As long as I'm here,

310
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,460
那我就看看他都藏了些什么
I should see what else he's hiding.

311
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,500
不行 拍好照片赶紧出来
No, get the picture, and get out.

312
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,700
滑动锁的好处在于
The trick with sliding locks

313
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,100
上面的手印会告诉你密码是什么
is they leave a smudge that can tell you what the code is.

314
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,330
你听起来可没再往外撤
This does not sound like you getting out.

315
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,200
关键是要找出数字的排列顺序
The key is guessing where it starts and where it ends.

316
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,130
他是左撇子还是右撇子?
Is he right or left-handed?

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,030
右撇子 怎么了?
Right. Why?

318
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,230
右撇子的人
Right-handed people

319
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,260
习惯性的按逆时针方向
instinctively draw counterclockwise.

320
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,330
我让你赶紧出来
I told you to get out.

321
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,900
后面有Forsythe的整个实验室
Forsythe has a whole lab back here.

322
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,630
里面有显微镜 试管
Microscopes, test tubes,

323
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,560
所有鉴定的仪器设备
all kinds of forensic equipment.

324
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
Forsythe回来了
Forsythe came back.

325
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,460
快好了
Almost done.

326
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,830
你是不是触发警报了?
Did you set off an alarm?

327
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,260
Peter 这话可真伤人
Peter, that's hurtful.

328
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,530
他正往你那边走
Either way, he's headed your way.

329
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,430
好了 这就走
All right, leaving now.

330
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,300
你在哪?
Where are you?

331
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,400
你在哪?
Where are you?

332
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,160
它叫双刃刀
It's called a macuahuitl.

333
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,430
"双人刀"
"Macua-neenle."

334
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,060
- 不 是"双刃刀"  - "双淫刀"
- No, "macua-heetle."  - "Macua-heednum."

335
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,100
- 不 是"双刃刀"  - 我就是这么说的
- No, "macua-heetle."  - I said that.

336
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,930
好吧 不管怎么说 你猜得对
Okay, either way, your hunch is right.

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,730
它是在纽约一次前哥伦布时期
It was stolen from a pre-Columbian exhibit

338
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,230
展览中被偷的
here in New York.

339
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,630
我猜Forsythe一直都在
I guess Forsythe does some business

340
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,030
和黑市做生意
in the black market after all.

341
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
但你要知道 它是很多年前被偷的
Yeah, but get this. It was stolen eight years ago.

342
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,760
诉讼时效已经过了
Statute of limitations is up.

343
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,500
Forsythe是个聪明人
Forsythe's a smart guy.

344
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,900
他知道我们不能因此抓他
He knows we can't get him on it.

345
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,460
当然了 他可不想
Sure, he didn't want to raise

346
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,660
在老虎的屁股上拔毛
a red flag in front of a bull.

347
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,530
但他在谋划一个更大的阴谋
Not when he's hiding something bigger.

348
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
像霸王龙这样的大活
For a job as big as a T-Rex,

349
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,730
他想找一个他信任的人
he'd wanna use somebody he can trust,

350
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
一个他打过交道的人
somebody he'd used before.

351
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,630
双刃刀的小偷有线索吗?
Any suspects in the macuahuitl theft?

352
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,430
没人被捕 但嫌疑人一共三个
There were no arrests, but there were three suspects.

353
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,760
一个在监狱里
One's in jail.

354
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,660
一个最近在布拉格被审讯
One recently questioned in prague.

355
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,500
最后是这家伙 Michael Holt
Then there's this guy, Michael Holt.

356
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
是东海岸的四宗抢劫案的嫌疑人
Suspected in four other robberies along the east coast.

357
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,400
他从不在一个地方久住
He doesn't stay in one place very long.

358
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,230
但就算是一个偷盗大师
No, but even a master thief needs time to unload

359
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,900
装卸40英尺高的恐龙化石也需要时间
a 40-foot prehistoric skeleton.

360
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,230
最起码在他离开纽约之前
Either way, we've got a narrow window

361
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,700
我们的怀疑范围缩小了
before he leaves town.

362
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,860
查一下他的踪迹
Track him down.

363
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,130
在此之前
Before we do,

364
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,630
你想不想知道Caffrey为什么
you wanna know why Caffrey

365
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,130
要在那个街角站着吗?
was standing on that street corner?

366
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
想知道
Yeah, I do.

367
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,360
你有什么线索?
What do you have?

368
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,000
不是东西 而是一个人
Not what. It's who.

369
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,530
我从街对面的监控录像里截下来的
I got this off a security camera from across the street.

370
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,530
她看着很眼熟
She looks familiar.

371
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,700
她叫Rebecca Lowe
Her name's Rebecca Lowe.

372
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,960
没错 就是之前Gershon失窃案
Yeah, the woman we brought in

373
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,700
我们带回来讯问的女人
from the Gershon heist a while back.

374
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,160
Neal和她在一起干什么?
What's Neal doing with her?

375
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,700
要知道 我跟El聊过
You know, I was talking to El,

376
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,800
她有个朋友想介绍你认识
she has a friend she'd like to set you up with.

377
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,230
这位朋友知道我有犯罪记录吗?
Does this friend know that I come with a rap sheet?

378
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
知道 有兴趣吗?
Uh-huh. Interested?

379
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,900
替我跟Elizabeth道谢 但我目前不想找女朋友
Tell Elizabeth thank you, but I'm not looking right now.

380
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,700
Sara离开也有段时间了
Well, it's been a while since Sara,

381
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,660
我觉得你也许会想开始新恋情
and I thought you might wanna get back out there.

382
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,300
我并不是指这对你来说很困难
Not that it's difficult for you.

383
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,730
你会惊讶的
You'd be surprised.

384
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,230
只要是和我恋爱的人 我都得跟她撒谎
Anyone I date, I have to lie to

385
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,230
或者猜测她为什么对个罪犯有兴趣
or wonder why she's interested in a felon.

386
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,860
就没遇上例外?
No luck at all?

387
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,360
Jones 怎么了?
Yeah, Jones?

388
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,230
去哪儿?
Where to?

389
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,430
好的
Yeah.

390
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,430
好 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

391
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,060
Holt跑了
Holt's gone.

392
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,660
Jones查了他的信用卡记录
Jones checked his credit cards.

393
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,200
他买了张机票逃出国了
He bought a plane ticket out of the country.

394
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,530
我会用自己的名字和信用卡买机票的
The only reason I'd buy a plane ticket under my name

395
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,560
唯一企图就是我想让别人误以为
with my credit card is if I wanted someone

396
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,030
我逃出国了
to think I'd left the country.

397
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,760
航空公司确认他登机了
The airline confirmed that he got on the plane.

398
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,200
航空公司只是确认了拿着Holt机票的人
The airline confirmed someone with Holt's ticket

399
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,560
登机了
got on the plane.

400
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,360
你记得那次你误以为我在摩纳哥吗?
You know that time you thought I was in Monaco?

401
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,930
别告诉我 我让国际刑警
Don't tell me that I had Interpol

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,430
搜索街道完全是无用功
scouring the streets for nothing.

403
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,800
我用自己的名字买了张头等舱机票
Bought a first-class ticket under my name

404
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,200
然后换了登机牌
and checked in for my flight.

405
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,600
等我到了登机口
Once I got to the gate,

406
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
就会找一个单独坐飞机 还只带了随身行李的人
I looked for someone traveling alone with a carry-on.

407
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,230
如果有人托运了行李
If someone checks a bag

408
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,660
但没上飞机
and doesn't get on the plane,

409
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,900
飞机就不会起飞
the flight doesn't take off.

410
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,000
然后我把机票送给他
So I offer them my ticket,

411
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,300
对方一定会收
which of course they're gonna take

412
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,130
因为一个要飞三千英里的正常人
because no sane person facing a 3,000-mile trip

413
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,760
是不会拒绝头等舱机票的
is gonna say no to a seat in first class.

414
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,830
他们不会怀疑进一步的目的?
And they don't suspect an ulterior motive?

415
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,660
并不是所有人都和你一样生性多疑 Peter
Not everyone is as naturally suspicious as you, Peter.

416
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,300
我的多疑天性可是
My nature has developed

417
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,760
常年分析你的可以行径得来的
from years of tracking your suspicious behavior.

418
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,830
所以这个陌生人没有生疑
So this unsuspecting stranger

419
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,530
拿了你的机票登机...
gets your ticket, gets on the plane...

420
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,430
然后Neal Caffrey的机票就去了摩纳哥
And Neal Caffrey is on his way to Monaco,

421
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,400
而真的Neal Caffrey就悄悄溜了出来
while the real Neal Caffrey slips out of the gate unnoticed.

422
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,430
不敢相信 你竟然不知道
I can't believe you never knew that.

423
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,860
监控拍到Michael Holt
Cameras caught Michael Holt

424
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,100
溜出了机场安检区
scoping out their security system.

425
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,230
他还想偷那枚蛋
He's still after that egg.

426
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,730
他觉得蛋在博物馆
He thinks it's at the museum.

427
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,900
抓Holt现行是我们追查
Catching Holt in the act is our best shot

428
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,830
失窃霸王龙的最佳机会
at tracking down that stolen T-Rex.

429
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,130
我会让监视小组
I'll put surveillance teams

430
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
全天候监视博物馆的
outside the museum around the clock.

431
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,330
- 随时向我汇报  - 好的
- Keep me posted.  - All right.

432
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,400
看来有人享受了头等舱的机票
Well, I guess someone else enjoyed that first-class ticket.

433
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,960
所以...
So...

434
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,830
Holt有了五十万的理由留下来
Holt had 1/2 million good reasons to stay.

435
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,400
你怎么知道Forsythe会付钱给Holt?
How did you know what Forsythe was gonna pay Holt?

436
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,730
我在密室里发现了装满钱的手提箱
I found a briefcase full of cash in his back room.

437
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,260
你开了密室?
And you opened it?

438
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,600
听着 这就是我生性多疑的原因
See, this is the reason I have a suspicious nature.

439
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,730
之后我得好好数数那箱钱
I'm gonna count every penny of it.

440
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,260
我没怪你 你应该如此
I don't blame you. You should.

441
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,560
只是大致估计了一下
It was a rough estimate though.

442
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,030
- 好吧  - 肯定是个整数
- Oh.  - It's a round number.

443
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,530
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, hon.

444
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,960
怎么了?
Yeah?

445
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,460
今晚想来个四人约会吗?
How'd you like to go on a double date tonight?

446
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,460
跟Trey和Sheila一起?
With Trey and Sheila?

447
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,330
是Neal
Neal.

448
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,500
- 他知道我们要去吗?  - 你说呢?
- Does he know we're coming?  - Mm?

449
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,460
所以他不知道我们要去
He doesn't know we're coming.

450
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,300
他一直偷偷和这个女人在一起
He's been sneaking around with this woman,

451
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,900
我觉得他肯定在计划什么
and I think he's up to something.

452
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,430
也许他只是在和个美女享用美食
Or maybe he's having a nice meal with a nice girl.

453
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,160
那Neal就没理由瞒着我了
There's no reason for Neal to keep this from me.

454
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,160
他要和姑娘约会 我怎么会在意?
What do I care if he's going on a date with a girl?

455
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,930
显然你很在意
Clearly you care quite a bit.

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,430
肯定没这么简单
Nah, there's more to it than this.

457
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,800
Neal最近的行为非常不正常
A lot of things Neal has been doing don't add up,

458
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,260
而我的直觉告诉我 她就是关键
and my gut tells me she's at the center of it.

459
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,960
根据他脚铐的数据
Now according to his anklet,

460
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,200
他们现在在Clifton餐厅
they're at the Clifton.

461
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,700
你知道我一直很想去Clifton餐厅的
You know I've always wanted to go to the Clifton.

462
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,130
真的?
Really?

463
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,030
你觉得这是个好主意?
You think this is a good idea?

464
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,930
没错
I do.

465
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,060
我觉得你可能会喜欢这个
Thought you might like this.

466
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,000
红酒很不错
The wine is lovely.

467
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,300
这让我想起了今年夏天
And it reminds me of this summer

468
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
我在法国念书的日子
that I spent in France studying.

469
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,660
我记得我去过这个酒庄
I actually think I've been to this vineyard.

470
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,530
真的?
Really?

471
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,060
真的
Really.

472
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,960
你是不是利用联邦调查局的资源调查过我?
Did you have the FBI run a background check on me?

473
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,900
联邦调查局和这顿晚餐无关
The FBI had nothing to do with this dinner.

474
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,060
我保证
I promise.

475
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,800
要知道 你从未告诉过我
Hmm, you know, you never told me

476
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,100
你怎么会成为联邦调查局探员的
why you became an FBI agent.

477
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,630
我想肯定不止是用来泡妞那么简单
I assume it wasn't only to pick up women.

478
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,430
一个爱好艺术的人 怎么会变成两帮调查局探员的?
How does an art lover become an FBI agent?

479
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,060
说来话长
Eh, it's a long story.

480
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,830
我这辈子一直在研究古文字
I spend my life studying ancient texts.

481
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,260
所以不介意冗长的故事
I don't mind long stories.

482
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,500
我只是想两个人私下好好吃顿晚饭 好吗?
I want this dinner to be about you and me, okay?

483
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,460
我们不用谈论工作的事情
We don't need to talk about work.

484
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,360
好吧
All right.

485
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,900
我真的很喜欢这地方
I really do like this place

486
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,730
喜欢这红酒 法典
and the wine and the codex

487
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,760
还有你的吻
and the kiss.

488
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,630
我也挺喜欢的
I liked that part too.

489
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,200
要知道 你...
You know, you...

490
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,660
要是想让我帮忙查案
you don't have to do all this

491
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,560
其实不必做这些
just to get my help on the case.

492
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,460
你真觉得我是这种人吗?
Do you really think I would do that?

493
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,700
不
No.

494
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,860
那你觉得我是怎样的人?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

495
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,100
我不知道 你可是个联邦调查局探员
I don't know. You're an FBI agent.

496
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,500
没错
Yeah.

497
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,560
如果太复杂了 我能理解
If it's too complicated, I'll understand.

498
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,660
你是在给我找台阶下吗?
Are you trying to give me a way out?

499
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,660
显然还不够巧妙
Apparently without much subtlety.

500
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,000
不
No.

501
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,060
我不需要
I don't want one.

502
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,260
你呢?
Do you?

503
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,730
不
No.

504
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,230
嘿 Neal?
Neal?

505
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,530
Peter 你怎么来了?
Peter, what are you doing here?

506
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,760
Elizabeth一直很想来这儿吃饭
Elizabeth has been dying to try this place out.

507
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,800
嗨 我叫Peter 是Neal的上司
Hi, I'm Peter, Neal's boss.

508
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,930
我们见过 我是Rebecca
We've met. I'm Rebecca.

509
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,260
你差点逮捕我
You almost arrested me.

510
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,400
没错 非常抱歉
Oh, right. Sorry about that.

511
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,500
不... 等等 我以为你上司是...
No, it's... Wait, I thought your boss was...

512
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,730
这位是Peter的妻子Elizabeth 
And this is Elizabeth, Peter's lovely wife.

513
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
很高兴认识你
It's so nice to meet you.

514
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,900
真的很抱歉 打扰你们了
I'm really sorry for interrupting.

515
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,030
没关系
Oh, nonsense.

516
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,000
朋友间可没什么秘密 对吧?
No secrets between friends, right?

517
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,400
当然没有
Course not.

518
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,100
我都不知道那案子之后
I didn't know that you two had been in touch

519
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,800
你们还有联系
since the investigation.

520
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,800
你们查案时候认识的?
You guys met on a case?

521
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,160
没错 要知道
Oh, yeah, you know

522
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,060
有时候不经意间 工作
how sometimes your personal and professional lives

523
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,300
和私生活就会混在一起
just crash into each other without any notice.

524
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,000
其实我和Peter就是这么认识的
It's actually how Peter and I met.

525
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,560
哦
Oh.

526
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,630
没错 我记得他还偷偷动用了调查局的资源
Yeah, agency resources were involved from what I recall.

527
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,400
那可是光明正大的
It was completely aboveboard.

528
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,730
事实上 我们刚说到
Actually, we were just talking

529
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Neal是怎么成为联邦调查局探员的
about how Neal became an FBI agent.

530
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,130
没错 但说来话长
Yeah, but it's a long story.

531
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,560
我也挺想听这个故事的
I know I'd love to hear that story.

532
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,260
我要去看看还有没有空桌
Um, I'm gonna go check and see if we can get a table.

533
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,260
你想跟我一起去吗?
Would you like to go with me?

534
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,730
让他们自己聊聊?
Maybe let the boys chat?

535
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,330
当然
Of course.

536
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,530
一会儿见
See you in a little bit.

537
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,230
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

538
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,530
你是在跟踪我吗?
Did you follow me here?

539
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,900
你最好再她们回来之前
You have until they come back

540
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,800
给我解释清楚她怎么会觉得你是联邦调查局探员的
to explain why she thinks you're an FBI agent,

541
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,260
否则我就告诉她真相
or I'm telling her the truth.

542
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,600
我们查案时认识的
We met on a case.

543
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
我跟她说我为联邦调查局工作
I told her I work for the FBI.

544
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,000
她就以为我是个探员
She assumed I was an agent.

545
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,300
你也没纠正她 对吧?
And you didn't correct her, did you?

546
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,700
我觉得没理由
I didn't see any reason to.

547
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,460
因为你这是在假冒联邦警员
Because you're impersonating a Federal officer.

548
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,100
我以为技术上...
I suppose technically...

549
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,800
别说技术上 你就是在假冒
No, not technically. You are.

550
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,630
还有推拿诊疗室的笔
The pen, the chiropractor's office.

551
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,030
你就是用这些让她相信的
This is all to convince her of this story.

552
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,560
你...
You're...

553
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,900
你喜欢她 对吧?
You like her, don't you?

554
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,930
好吧
Huh.

555
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,160
撒谎还真是种奇怪的表现方式
Lying is a funny way of showing it.

556
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,400
她没把我当成罪犯看 懂吗?
She doesn't look at me like a criminal, okay?

557
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,730
我在她眼里
She looks at me

558
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,360
就跟El眼里的你一样
the way El looks at you.

559
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,530
我不想毁了这一切
I don't want to ruin that.

560
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,030
Neal 你朋友真不错
Neal, you have lovely friends.

561
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,400
他们真是不错 对吧?
Oh, aren't they great?

562
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,860
我们就不打扰你们俩了
We are gonna get out of your hair right now.

563
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,700
有空桌了 来吧 我们走
We got a table. Come on, let's go.

564
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,460
好
Sure.

565
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,330
你们俩还有很多要聊呢
You two have lots to talk about.

566
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,300
失陪一下
Excuse me one minute.

567
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,400
我是Burke探员
This is Agent Burke.

568
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
我是Khatri博士
It's Dr. Khatri.

569
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,900
有人闯进来了
Someone's here.

570
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,560
我不认识他
I don't recognize him.

571
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,030
保持冷静 博士
All right, remain calm, Doctor.

572
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,600
我们有探员在博物馆里
We have agents in the museum.

573
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,900
我没在博物馆
No, I'm not there.

574
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,230
我把蛋带到我的实验室做CT扫描
I took the egg to my lab to run a CAT scan.

575
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,100
挂了电话 找个安全的地方躲起来
Hang up and find someplace safe.

576
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,800
我们马上就过去
We'll be there soon.

577
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,430
Neal 我们得走了 Khatri博士有危险
Neal, we have to go. Dr. Khatri's in trouble.

578
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,330
纽约警局的人正赶来 不过我们更快
N.Y.P.D. is on the way, but we're closer.

579
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,560
我们没时间了!
We're running out of time!

580
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,460
告诉我在哪!
You better tell me where it is!

581
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,000
你觉得我是在开玩笑吗?
What, you think I'm playing games?

582
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,000
我不会给你的
I'll never give it to you.

583
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
是Holt
It's Holt.

584
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,560
我不想再说一遍
I'm not gonna ask again.

585
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,000
如果我们贸然闯进去 他会开枪的
If we go in with guns drawn, he might shoot her.

586
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,660
Khatri不会交出蛋的
Khatri's not giving up that egg.

587
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,800
我们得想办法
We gotta come up with something,

588
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,600
不然她死定了
or she's gonna get herself killed.

589
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,960
那该死的蛋在哪?
Where the hell is the egg?

590
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,960
它的母亲在哪? 你们对她做了什么?
Where is the mother? What have you done with her?

591
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,130
它只是颗蛋 告诉我在哪
It's just an egg. Tell me where it is.

592
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,530
没这么简单
It's so much more than that.

593
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,760
它是一个需要母亲的孩子
It is a child that needs to be with its mother,

594
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,330
给了你 我会良心不安的
and I'll be damned if I'll ever give it up to you.

595
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,400
那你去死吧
Have it your way.

596
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,600
博士 你有同位素的结果报告...
Doctor, do you have the isotopic results...

597
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,960
站那别动
Hold it right there.

598
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,030
我不想惹事 好吗?
I don't want any trouble, okay?

599
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,330
该死的蛋在哪?
Where is the damn egg?

600
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,130
我带你去拿
I'll show you.

601
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,130
不行 你不能给他
No, you can't give it to him.

602
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,900
我可不想为了一颗化石吃子弹 懂吗?
I'm not taking a bullet for a fossil, all right?

603
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,860
跟我来
Follow me.

604
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,600
就在这边
Right through here.

605
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,160
放开我!
Get off of me!

606
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,600
帮我一下
Give me a hand.

607
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,800
不是每个贼都自己带着手铐
Not every thief who brings their own handcuffs.

608
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,700
你很有想法
Very thoughtful of you.

609
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,960
Holt承认是Forsythe雇佣他
Holt confirmed that Forsythe hired him

610
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,160
来抢化石的
for the fossil heist.

611
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,930
那你怎么还不为了
So why are you not doing

612
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,630
可以找到恐龙而高兴?
an "about to get the dinosaur" happy dance?

613
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,260
因为他不知道恐龙在哪儿
Because he doesn't know where the dinosaur is located.

614
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,160
如果我们现在逮捕了Forsythe
And if we arrest Forsythe now,

615
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,630
我们就不可能找到霸王龙了
there's no guarantee we'll get the t-rex back.

616
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,800
我们的证据太过宽泛
And our evidence is largely circumstantial.

617
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,100
需要有力的证据
I want hard proof.

618
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,730
- 你想要恐龙  - 我当然想要
- You want the dinosaur.  - Damn right I do.

619
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,160
Khatri博士肯定很高兴听到这个
Dr. Khatri will be happy to hear that.

620
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,230
我刚刚从医院回来
Just got off with the hospital.

621
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,730
她没事
She's fine,

622
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,300
只是受了点惊吓
just a little shaken up.

623
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,730
我们现在只有一张牌可打
There's only one chip we can play right now.

624
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,830
那颗蛋
The egg.

625
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,300
我们可以在上面弄个追踪器
We can plant a tracker on it.

626
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,200
我敢说他会把蛋和霸王龙藏在一起
I bet he'll stash it with the t-rex fossils.

627
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,660
跟踪他 然后逮捕
Follow him, make a clean arrest.

628
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,060
我不想用蛋去引诱他
I don't wanna put the egg in play.

629
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,060
太珍贵 也太重要了
It's too valuable, too important.

630
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,060
哦
Oh.

631
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,500
幸运的是
Lucky for us,

632
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,730
我们有人有伪造化石的前科
we know someone with a history of forging fossils.

633
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,230
Khatri博士给了我一些
Dr. Khatri gave me fragments

634
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,530
方解石和沉积岩的碎块
of real calcite shell and sedimentary rock.

635
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,800
我要用大理石雕蛋中间的部分
I'll sculpt the core from alabaster.

636
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,260
- 黏合剂呢?  - 已经准备好了
- Adhesives?  - Already mixed.

637
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,800
我们开始吧
We should get started.

638
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,860
我想你不是真要我来吧?
I assume you don't mean the royal we?

639
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,300
好假设
A correct assumption.

640
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,030
好吧
Oh.

641
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,130
盐酸和碳化钙在一起
The hydrochloric acid is reacting perfectly

642
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,060
反应得很好啊
with the calcium carbonate in the shell.

643
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,060
我们做了一个恐龙蛋 Moz
We made a baby dinosaur, Moz.

644
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,430
就像父亲伪造胚胎一样
Ah, like father, like forged embryo.

645
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,030
每个都装上脚铐
Each with his own anklet.

646
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,400
至少Peter跟着这个
At least Peter won't be able

647
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,830
不会找上Rebecca
to follow this tracker to Rebecca.

648
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,800
自从上次倒霉晚餐后 你联系过她吗?
Oh, have you spoken to her since your ill-fated dinner?

649
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,660
我警告过你 Neal
I warned you, Neal.

650
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,100
你 生意 女人
You, business, and women.

651
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,700
邪恶铁三角 我知道
Unholy trinity, I get it.

652
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,330
你应该感激
Well, you can be grateful

653
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,460
猫咪探长没揭穿你的身份
that the Suit didn't expose your agent nom de guerre.

654
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,030
我是很感激
Well, I am.

655
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Peter再深究怎么办?
What happens when Peter digs deeper?

656
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,700
会发现法典的事情
Could find out about the codex.

657
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,700
是啊 或者Hagen
Yeah, or Hagen.

658
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,660
小心点吧
Cause for concern.

659
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,230
记好了 结束才有新的生机
Keep in mind, to make an end is to make a beginning.

660
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,260
你认为我应该跟她结束?
You think I should end it with her?

661
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,860
托马斯·斯特尔那斯·艾略特说的(诺贝尔文学奖获得者)
That was T.S. Eliot.

662
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,660
但如果猫咪探长注意到Rebecca了
But if Rebecca is on big brother's radar,

663
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,430
那就是时候结束了
the timing could be right.

664
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,700
好吧 对教堂的事情有计划了吗?
All right, do we have a game plan for the church yet?

665
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,600
我正在计划
I'm working on it.

666
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,860
在大庭广众之下
But to steal the stained glass window

667
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,830
偷走彩绘色玻璃窗是很难的
will be difficult with so many witnesses.

668
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,260
是啊 这事情也不急
Well, that's a problem that can wait a day.

669
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,930
确实
Indeed.

670
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,160
今天我们重现了白垩纪
Today we revive the cretaceous period.

671
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,600
明天我们去偷也许
Tomorrow we steal a window

672
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,160
和疯子写的书有关联的玻璃窗
that could be connected to a bedlamite's tome.

673
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,230
这就是生活
C'est la vie.

674
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,360
这就是生活
C'est la vie.

675
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,060
不错啊
Not bad.

676
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,460
本来我想完事后送你
I was gonna give it to you after this,

677
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,660
如果你觉得它不好...
but if you don't think it's very good...

678
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,560
"不错"并不意味着"不好"
"Not bad" doesn't mean "not good."

679
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,830
也不意味着"好"
It doesn't mean "good."

680
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,300
我会送给能欣赏它的人
I'll give it to someone who can appreciate it.

681
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,730
不 这是联邦调查局资产 我想要就可以拿走
No, this is FBI property. I can take it if I want.

682
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,360
好了 连上追踪器了
Okay, the tracker's live.

683
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,800
一旦Forsythe拿走了蛋 我们会紧跟他
When Forsythe moves the egg, we'll be right behind him.

684
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,830
Neal 说说你的卧底身份是
Neal, tell us about your cover.

685
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,600
John Mcdowell 和Michael Holt是同伙
John Mcdowell. Accomplice to Michael Holt.

686
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,860
来着送蛋的
Here to deliver the egg

687
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,200
因为联邦调查局在调查Holt
because the FBI is looking into Holt,

688
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,300
他现在得低调行事
and he's laying low.

689
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,530
Holt已经承认了
Which was confirmed by Holt

690
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,160
他安排了和Forsythe见面
when he called Forsythe to set up the meeting.

691
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,630
我们会一直监听你
We'll have ears on you the whole time.

692
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,460
带着这样一件赝品 肯定不会有问题
With a forgery like this, you should be out quickly.

693
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,860
带着五百万啊
With 1/2 million in cash.

694
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,360
联邦调查局在调查Holt?
The FBI is investigating Holt?

695
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,960
我该担心吗?
Should I worry?

696
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,000
不用 只是一个探员
Nah, it's just one agent shaking every tree he can find

697
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,260
遍地撒网而已
to see what falls out.

698
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,560
他没有任何证据
He doesn't have anything.

699
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,830
但是为了安全起见 我代替Holt来
But to be safe, I'm here instead of Holt.

700
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,300
如果你不想要蛋的话
Hey, if you don't want the egg anymore,

701
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,800
我可以转卖给别人
I'm sure I can unload it somewhere else.

702
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,060
别 别 没事的
No, no, no, no. It's fine.

703
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,300
我想要看看
I wanna see it.

704
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,100
不错
Ha.

705
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,130
别急着动手 这还不是你的
Uh-uh. No, it's not yours yet.

706
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,760
除非你付我钱
Not till you pay me.

707
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,000
你太着急了
You're getting ahead of yourself.

708
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,130
我需要鉴定一下
I need to authenticate it first.

709
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,060
那就快点把
Let's get a move on.

710
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,860
抓紧时间
Ticktock.

711
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,760
方解石含量和卵石纹路看上去是对的
Calcite levels and pebble texture appear appropriate.

712
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,900
我想这是好消息
I assume that's good news.

713
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,330
大大的好消息
Oh, it very much is.

714
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,930
我想你这下可以付我钱了吧
Then I think this is the part where you pay me.

715
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,430
我会的
I will.

716
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,800
等我做最后一项测试
After one last test.

717
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,300
有太多次
Can't tell you how many times

718
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,030
三脚猫想要用假的文物
two-bit hustlers have tried to rip me off

719
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,660
从我这打劫
with fake artifacts.

720
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,900
所以CT扫描就很有必要
Which is where the CAT scan comes in handy.

721
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,860
他不会看到里面有胚胎
He won't see an embryo on a CAT scan.

722
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,330
但他会看到跟踪器
But he will see the tracker.

723
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,030
扫描会进行十分钟
The scan will take about ten minutes.

724
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,800
所以耐心等着
So settle in.

725
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,000
听着 我可不觉得这么件小事要花这么久
Look, I didn't think this was gonna be an all-day thing.

726
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,430
知道吗?
Okay?

727
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,330
你是担心扫描会出问题?
You worried the scan won't work?

728
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,760
不 我只是不懂
No, I just don't understand

729
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,100
之前做了那么多测试
what this thing is gonna show you

730
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,060
这玩意还能测出什么新花样
that all the other tests didn't.

731
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,030
能测出里面有什么
It'll show me what's inside.

732
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,800
或者没有什么
Or what isn't.

733
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,500
咱们得让Neal撤出来
We need to pull Neal out of there.

734
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,300
等等 Khatri博士应该有一份那个蛋的CT扫描图
Wait, Dr. Khatri should have a CAT scan of the egg.

735
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,430
我联系她看看能不能发一份过来
I'll call to see if she can send one to us.

736
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,660
听说过马克胡特吗?
You ever heard of a Macuahuitl?

737
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,760
不就是你手上正拿着的这件武器嘛
It's the weapon you're holding in your hands right now.

738
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,600
John 关于这件武器 你还知道什么呢?
What else can you tell me about this weapon, John?

739
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,200
特别是你面前这一件?
Anything about this one in particular?

740
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,430
八年前我跟Holt在纽约
I stole it for you eight years ago

741
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,960
合力为你偷来的
with Holt right here in New York.

742
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,130
而且你拿的姿势不对
You're holding it wrong.

743
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,460
不介意吧?
You mind?

744
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,460
早期的马克胡特在手柄顶端要宽两英寸
The early Macuahuitl handle is 2 inches wider at the top.

745
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,900
要这样拿
Hold it like this.

746
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,230
握得越紧 挥动越迅速
Better grip means a faster swing.

747
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,930
更好把控
More control.

748
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,360
你的建议不错
You're right.

749
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,630
说起来 我也偷过不少东西
You know, I've stolen a lot of things,

750
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,900
但极少是纯粹为了拥有而下手的
but I've rarely taken anything just to have it.

751
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,230
有朝一日值得一试
You should try it sometime.

752
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,500
马上就要扫到胚胎那里了
We should be at the embryo any moment now.

753
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,460
什么事?
Yeah?

754
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,800
他来这干什么?
Why is he here?

755
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,930
好吧
Fine.

756
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,300
我马上就到
I'll be right there.

757
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,860
谁来了?
Who's here?

758
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,530
那个联邦调查局探员 还不死心呢
That FBI agent. Still shaking his trees.

759
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,800
别担心 我来搞定他
Don't worry, I'll get rid of him.

760
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,400
Forsythe先生 多谢赏脸
Mr. Forsythe, thanks for seeing me.

761
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,430
我不会占用您太多时间
I won't take up much of your time.

762
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,260
这是Michael Holt 他是我们
Michael Holt, he's our prime suspect

763
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,230
在化石窃案中的主要嫌疑人
in the fossil shipment theft.

764
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,760
这跟我有什么关系?
What's it got to do with me?

765
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,330
我只是在想 他或许会来向您兜售
I was wondering if maybe he approached you on buying them.

766
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,460
这样啊 只要他联系我 我第一个告知你
Well, if he contacts me, you'll be my first call.

767
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,430
就等着您这句话呢
All I wanted to hear.

768
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,230
那就慢走不送了
Then you'll be on your way.

769
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,700
说起来 虽然迅猛龙的名字意思是"快手贼"
You know, even though their name means "speedy thief",

770
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,500
但它们的速度其实并没那么快
they say that the velociraptor wasn't particularly fast.

771
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,700
的确如此
That's true.

772
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,930
而且也不聪明
And that it was dumb.

773
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,600
我猜大脑的容量也不大
Yeah, not much room for a brain in there, I guess.

774
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,730
不过是一只迟缓 迟钝 长着巨齿的大鸡
One slow, dumb chicken with big teeth.

775
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,700
别碰那个头骨
Don't touch the skull.

776
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,600
这些牙齿您是怎么粘起来的?
How do you keep them glued in there?

777
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,330
环氧树脂还是廉价胶?
Epoxy or tacky?

778
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,430
Burke探员 别...
Agent Burke, don't...

779
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,600
看来你该用强力胶的
Guess you should've used superglue.

780
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,900
- 玩够了吗?  - 嗯
- Is that all?  - Mm-hmm.

781
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,400
抱歉弄坏了你的恐龙
Sorry I broke your dinosaur.

782
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,660
快看看
Well, will you look at that?

783
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,060
钱在公文包里
Money's in the briefcase.

784
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,500
很荣幸跟你做生意
Pleasure doing business with you.

785
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,160
趁着没人做的那些见不得人的事
The things people do when they think no one's watching.

786
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,060
就好比跟踪自己的朋友
Like following your friend to a first date

787
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,330
毁了他的首次约会?
and crashing it?

788
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,860
走吧
Come on.

789
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,260
让Forsythe见识见识联邦调查局是怎么看待自然选择的
Let's show Forsythe how the FBI handles natural selection.

790
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,360
就憋出这么一句?
You just think of that one?

791
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,330
嗯 出动吧
Yeah, on the way over.

792
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,760
你在这干什么?
What the hell are you doing here?

793
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,760
我想了想你说的话
I thought about what you said.

794
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,800
我想清楚了自己想要什么
I figured out what I wanna take.

795
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,260
你怎么跟我到这来的?
How'd you follow me?

796
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,760
那个小家伙告诉我的
That little guy told me where you were.

797
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,360
或者至少可以说是里面那个GPS追踪器的功劳
Or at least a GPS tracker we put inside it did.

798
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,500
走吧
Let's go.

799
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,830
打开
Open it up.

800
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,430
这是当真俘获了我的想象力
Okay, that definitely captures my imagination.

801
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,400
你想当古生物学家已经晚了
You know, it's not too late for you to be a paleontologist.

802
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
有些东西远观即可 距离产生美
Some things are better enjoyed from a distance.

803
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,430
正如大型盗窃案一般
Oh, like grand larceny.

804
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,800
你就没点正当合法的兴趣爱好吗?
Are all of your hobbies illegal?

805
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,160
国际象棋
I like chess.

806
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,130
你曾在联合广场兜售国际象棋
You hustled chess in Union Square.

807
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,260
Burke探员
Agent Burke.

808
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,600
Caffrey先生 跟我来
Mr. Caffrey, follow me.

809
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,030
你们得看看这个
You need to see this.

810
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,430
这就是她
Here she is.

811
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,900
她真是...
She's...

812
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,200
雄伟
majestic.

813
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,830
正因为你们俩
This mother and child reunion

814
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,630
这对母子才得以重聚
was only possible because of you two.

815
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,560
博物馆方面欠您一份人情
The museum is in your debt.

816
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,100
我倒是知道有人想要个全年免票
I know someone who would love a year-round pass.

817
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,330
Burke探员 您在我们这边有VIP资格
Agent Burke, you have VIP status here.

818
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,560
我们的大门一直向您敞开
Our doors are always open.

819
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,200
Peter Burke 你可是VIP啊 我们得给你搞个徽章
Peter Burke, VIP. We should get you a badge.

820
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,460
低调点 谢谢你 博士
Quiet. Thank you, Doctor.

821
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

822
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
今晚来我家吃晚饭
Come by the house for dinner tonight.

823
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,600
El要做柠檬鲈鱼
El's cooking branzino.

824
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,600
柠檬鲈鱼 瞧瞧你多滋润
Branzino, look at you.

825
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,960
我的生活也可以很炫的
I can be fancy.

826
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,930
多谢邀请 但...
Thanks for the invitation, but...

827
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,400
不是邀请
It's not an invitation.

828
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,400
看来是命令了?
So it's an order?

829
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,960
晚上七点
7:00 p.m.

830
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,460
别迟到了 Caffrey探员
Don't be late, Agent Caffrey.

831
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,860
真是糟糕
Bad news.

832
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,560
又是一顿佳肴
Another amazing meal.

833
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,700
必须的 这可是出自你手
Well, it should be. It's your recipe.

834
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,160
当初应该在烧烤时露一手的
Should've thrown it on a barbecue.

835
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,000
千万别让他当副主厨
Never let him be sous chef.

836
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,030
其实他还是挺擅长烧烤的
He's actually very good on the barbecue.

837
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,600
好吧... Rebecca
So... Rebecca.

838
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,100
- 没错 Rebecca  - 你们想听什么?
- Yeah, Rebecca.  - What do you wanna know?

839
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
你告诉她一切了吗?
Have you told her everything?

840
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,130
一切?
Everything?

841
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,500
你为什么为联邦调查局工作?
Why you're working for the FBI?

842
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,930
- 你为什么戴着脚链?  - 她看到过吗?
- Why you're wearing an anklet?  - Has she seen it?

843
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,700
好吧 我只是在等待合适的时机
Okay, I was waiting for the right time.

844
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,660
不存在什么合适的时机 Neal
There's no right time, Neal.

845
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,960
如果我告诉她真相 你们觉得会怎么样?
What do you think happens if I tell her the truth?

846
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,160
时间拖得越久
The more time passes,

847
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,100
真相便越伤人
the more the truth will hurt.

848
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,530
如果你对她是真心的
If you really want this to work,

849
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,830
现在就告诉她
tell her now.

850
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,100
祈祷她会接受你
Pray she'll accept it.

851
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,200
你也这么觉得?
You agree?

852
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,160
如果你真的在乎Rebecca
If you really care about Rebecca,

853
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,200
她就有权了解真正的你
she deserves to know the real you.

854
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,360
好吧 那假如当初Peter跟你相识之初
Okay, if Peter had told you something like this

855
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,600
向你坦白了类似的情况 你会接受他吗?
when you first met, would you have accepted it?

856
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,700
老实说 Neal 我... 我不知道
Honestly, Neal, I... I don't know.

857
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,730
但我会希望选择是我自己做出的
But I'd want the choice to decide.

858
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,400
我相信Rebecca也同样如此
And so will Rebecca.

859
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,400
这个险你不得不冒
It's a risk you should take.

860
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,560
我简直不想问你这玩意是怎么搞来的
I don't wanna ask why you have that thing.

861
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,300
就在那儿 不拿白不拿
Mm, it was there for the taking.

862
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,330
谢了
Thank you.

863
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,360
别客气 干杯
You're welcome. Cheers.

864
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,330
- 干杯  - 嗯
- Cheers.  - Mmm.

865
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,330
Byron以前一直说这座城市会跟他对话
Byron always said the city spoke to him.

866
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,960
可以想见
I can relate to that.

867
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,460
你很像他
You're a lot like him.

868
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
他告诉你他是个罪犯的时候 你作何感想?
How did you feel when he told you he was a criminal?

869
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,530
很心痛
It hurt.

870
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,860
但我依然爱他
But I loved him.

871
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,800
他做过什么并不重要
And it didn't matter what he was.

872
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,200
重要的是他是什么样的人
It only mattered who he was.

873
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,400
我也希望我能将这二者区分
I wish I could separate the two.

874
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,730
时间会给你答案的
Well, you'll learn with time.

875
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,400
等一下
Just a second.

876
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,030
嘿 有新发现了?
Hey. Find something new?

877
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,430
- 嗯  - 太棒了
- Yeah.  - Great.

878
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,660
其实没有
No.

879
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,900
我是想假装发现了什么
I was gonna lie, pretend I found something,

880
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,560
但我只是想来看看你
but I just wanted to come see you.

881
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,760
无论现在我们之间算是什么关系
Whatever this is between us,

882
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,200
我... 我都不想停下来
I... I don't want it to stop.

883
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,260
我也不想
I don't either.

884
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,760
是吗?
Yeah?

885
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,130
但有件事你应该先知道
But there's something you should know about me.

886
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,860
好的
Okay.

887
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,530
我不是联邦调查局探员
I'm not an FBI agent.

888
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,060
我是个罪犯线人
I'm a criminal informant.

889
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,130
我因伪造债券被定罪
I was convicted of bond forgery

890
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,330
在成为罪犯线人之前
and served part of a four-year sentence

891
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,360
服过四年刑期的一部分
before I became a CI.

892
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,000
我... 我没明白
I'm... I don't understand.

893
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,460
我去过你的办公室
I've been to your office.

894
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,230
我一直与你的上司Gruetzner探员合作
I've been working with your boss, Agent Gruetzner.

895
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,660
他不是我的上司
Yeah, he's not my boss.

896
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,960
我真正的上司是Peter Burke 那天晚餐遇见的那位
My real boss is Peter Burke, who you met at dinner.

897
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,230
那个办公室只是事先布置好
That office was just a setup

898
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,660
为了让你帮忙破解法典的
to get your help with the codex.

899
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:12,660
你布置了一间假办公室以便向我撒谎?
You set up a fake office all so you could lie to me?

900
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,860
你到底是不是在研究法典啊?
Are you even researching the codex?

901
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,260
是的
I am.

902
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,260
只不过不是为联邦调查局调查
Just not for the FBI.

903
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,830
Rebecca啊
Rebecca.

904
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
你为什么这样对我?
Why would you do this to me?

905
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,930
我需要你的帮助
I needed your help, all right?

906
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,560
而我...
And I...

907
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,200
我没想到这件事
I didn't expect this.

908
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,900
我没想到我们会有进展
I didn't expect us.

909
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,960
还有什么别的瞒着我的吗?
Is there anything else I should know?

910
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,800
谢谢
Thank you.

911
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,430
我想我...
I think I was just...

912
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,960
June啊!
June!

913
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,760
是Neal啊!
Neal!

914
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,100
我刚才在和这位出色的男士聊天
I was just chatting with this wonderful man,

915
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,130
叫...
Mr...

916
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,760
叫我Curtis就好
You can call me "Curtis".

917
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,600
Curtis 好可爱的名字
Curtis. It's a lovely name.

918
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,030
谢谢
Thank you.

919
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,700
那...
Well, I think...

920
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,600
我就先走了
I'll just be running along.

921
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,760
Hagen 离她远点
You stay away from her, Hagen.

922
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,000
你的人生大楼还真不错
Quite the life you've built.

923
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,700
不想目睹一切因一小扇窗而崩塌
Hate to see things fall apart over one little window.

924
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,930
没错 我知道法典有线索指引到彩绘玻璃
That's right, I know that the codex leads to the window.

925
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,730
你已经在准备为我偷玻璃了 真是幸运不是吗?
Isn't it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me?

926
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,060
你一直都是这么计划的 对吧?
That was what you were planning, wasn't it?

927
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,500
- 当然  - 很好
- Of course.  - Good.

928
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,060
这样对大家都好
That would be best for everyone.
