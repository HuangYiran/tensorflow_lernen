你的死期到了
Now,you die

太棒了 但是裁判吹哨了
It's good,but the ref's on the whistle

51
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,327
他犯规了 应该是撞人了
He's calling a foul.It could be charging

52
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:39,922
十号 他可能对此不开心

这家伙可能会被罚出场

00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,474
他
He

150
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:30,745
他是个艺术家
He was a real artist,you know

151
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,383
不过奇怪的是
Strange thing is,though

152
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:35,396
今天早上垃圾桶是空的
Bins were empty this morning

153
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,448
这怎么奇怪了
Why is that strange

154
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:39,230
因为今天是周日
Cause it's a Sunday

155
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,038
周末打猎 在这片区域来说
Weekend hunts are pretty much a

156
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:42,423
基本上是大丰收
Given in the neck of the woods

157
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:45,590
所以垃圾箱应该塞满内脏才对
So they're usually chock-full of guts

158
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:49,215
有没有可能是Max自己已经清理过了呢
Any chance Max could have cleaned them out himself

159
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:49,854
不可能
No

160
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,423
那东西有的有毒
It is a biohazard

161
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:53,576
你不能就这么轻易把它们清理干净
You can't just,you know,throw the stuffs out

162
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:55,343
得用火烧
You got to burn it

163
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,937
店里有没有其他东西报失
Is there anything else missing from the shop

164
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,808
没有
No

165
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:03,369
外来人员登记很完整 保险箱完好无损
The register was full and safe was intact

166
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,257
Max所有的作品都完好的待在墙上
And all of Max's trophies were still on the walls

167
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,255
除了你还有别人来过吗
Were there anybody else here when you showed up

168
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,350
没有了
No one

169
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,222
当然
Well,other than

170
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,280
除了 Colonel
The Colonel

171
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,467
失陪了
Excuse us

172
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:22,921
那么
So

173
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:27,293
咱们找到了个喜欢收集动物器官的贼
Okay,so we got a thief who's jonesing for animal parts

174
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,675
奇怪的符号
We got a pagan symbol

175
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,916
还有一块人肉卷饼
We get a human pretzel

176
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,570
是啊 这事儿很像是巫师干的
Yeah,it all sounds very witchy

177
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,386
但是我没找到任何巫术袋
But I wasn't able to find a hex bags

178
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,090
好吧 咱们再继续查一查
All right,well,let's keep digging

179
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:36,295
但是
But

180
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:37,309
不在这儿
Not here

181
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:40,038
我不喜欢它看着我的眼神
Don't like the way that one's looking at me

182
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,254
好了
Okay

183
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:54,867
那个涂鸦并不是巫术
Symbol in the graffiti,it's not wiccan

184
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,249
其实是个商标
It's copywritten

开什么玩笑
You got to be kidding me

191
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:08,367
一群动物保护主义者跟标本制作商有仇
It makes sense that an animal-rights group

192
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,378
这事儿还挺容易理解的
Would have an axe to grind with a taxidermist

193
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:11,585
为什么
Why

194
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,926
那些动物本来就死了呀
The animal's already dead

195
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,046
是这样没错 但是猎人们可以继续
Yeah,but hunters are what

196
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:15,273
支持着整个行业
Keep them in business

197
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:16,968
现在的问题是
Now the question is

198
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:19,528
这帮动物保护主义者到底是巫师
Are those bleeding hearts actually witches

199
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:21,310
还是一帮乱涂鸦的小混混
Or just hippies

200
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:24,596
有什么区别吗
What's the difference

我就知道万恶之源
Always knew I'd find the source of all evil

203
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,058
会潜伏在素食店里
At a vegan bakery

什么味道
What's that smell

广藿香
A patchouli

注 常用于制作香水 香薰 杀虫剂 也是一味中药

混合着因为缺少肉食而产生的怨气
Mixed with depression from meat deprivation

You two are remembers of S.N.A.R.T.

事实上 是组织者和联合主席
Founders and co-presidents actually

217
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:06,430
有没有兴趣拿点儿资料看看
Can we interest you in some literature

218
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,131
或者来一块亚麻籽司康饼
Or a flaxseed scone

219

零谷物 零面粉 零糖分

-And suprisingly moist -Let me stop you right there

221
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,375
我们是来调查
We're here to investigate

他死了吗
He's dead

225
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:22,799
你认识他
You knew him

226
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,018
差不多吧
Ish

227
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,288
毕竟是个小镇
Small town

228
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,744
他昨晚被杀了
Well,he's murdered last night

229
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,273
S.N.A.R.T.的标志出现在犯罪现场
And the S.N.A.R.T. logo was found at the crime scene

230
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:31,849
你们俩不会恰好
You two wouldn't happen to

231
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,360
知道些什么内幕吧
Know anything about that,would you

232
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,185
他的业务都是靠猎人搞起来的
His business is funded by hunters

233
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,480
猎人都是一个德性
And you know how hunters are

234
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,206
一群自负的混蛋
They're selfish dicks

235
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,676
禽兽不如
Who define themselves by what they kill

236
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,998
作为倡议保护动物一员 
And as animal advocates

237
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,687
我们无法接受他们的行为
We couldn't stand for that

238
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,095
所以你们杀了他
So you killed him

239
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:52,928
当然没有
Of course not

240
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:55,024
S.N.A.R.T.提倡零暴力
S.N.A.R.T. doesn't tolerate violence

241
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:57,435
零暴力就等于
This coming from a couple

242
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,115
散播恐吓涂鸦吗
Who spray paints death threats

243
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,548
那只是个提醒而已 我们就是想吓吓他
It was a scare tactic,we just wanted to spook him

244
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:03,889
但结果我们自己反被吓到了
Turns out we're the ones who got spooked

245
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:05,538
你什么意思
What does that mean

246
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,223
昨天晚上
Last night

247
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:11,904
我们俩碰头的时候
When we were tagging the joint

248
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,079
我们听到了一些动静
We heard this noise

249
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:13,974
嘶嘶的叫声
A hissing noise

250
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:15,716
我们吓坏了 然后跑进了巷子里
It freaked us out so we ran out into the alley

251
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,715
但是有人袭击了我们
But someone attacked us

252
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,035
把梅斯毒气喷进了我们的眼睛里
Sprayed us in the eyes with mace

253
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,393
但我俩不可能报警
And it's not like we could go to the cops

254
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:21,294
所以现在我们看起来像两个傻逼一样
So now we will look like total douchebags

255
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,815
因为我们在屋子里也戴着墨镜
Because we have to wear sunglasses inside

256
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:38,612
坏死病吗
Necrosis

257
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,002
细胞组织早亡
Premature death of tissues

258
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:42,389
所以他们的眼睛才变成了那样
That's why their eyes were all messed up

259
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,037
但并不是因为什么梅斯毒气
And it's not caused by mace

260
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,612
那是什么
All right then,what cause it

261
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,518
这儿写着呢
Right here

262
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:49,652
钝物敲击 射线侵染 毒液
A blunt force,radiation,venom

263
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,250
比如蛇的毒液
As in snack

264
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:53,174
那个标本制作商被勒碎了
The taxidermist was constricted

265
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,357
Olivia和Dylan听到了嘶嘶声
Olivia and Dylan heard hissing

266
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,934
然后眼睛被喷洒了液体
And they were sprayed in the eyes

267
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,012
毒液
By venom

268
00:10:58,216 --> 00:10:59,314
那么
Okay,so

269
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,249
咱们要对付的
What are we talking here,some sort of a

270
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:03,357
是一只奇葩蛇精
Freaky-ass snake monster

271
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,494
有可能
Maybe

272
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:06,581
但是奇怪的是
The weird thing is

273
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,788
蛇要么是把猎物毒死 要么把猎物勒死
Snakes either envenomate or constrict

274
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:12,188
这两件事不会同时发生
No snake does both

275
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,188
那我更正一下
Correction

276
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,666
是巨奇葩蛇精
Freaky ass mega snake monster

277
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,011
可能是个Vetala干的
That could be a Vetala

278
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,574
是啊 但它们可直接上嘴咬
Yeah,but they're not afraid to sink their fangs in

279
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:22,596
标本制作商身上没有咬痕
Taxidermist was bite-free

280
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:23,407
跟valata习性不符
Doesn't really fit the profile

281
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,214
是啊
Right

282
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,585
那么
So

283
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,530
打给Kevin
So call Kevin

284
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,714
让他查查相关资料
Have him looked some stuff up

285
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:30,852
伊尼德动物收留中心

286
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,051
你是不是来早了
Aren't you early

287
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:43,976
老兄
Dude

288
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,120
老兄
Dude

289
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,227
你不是香水公司的吗
You said you were from a perfume company

290
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:22,438
不 不 不要啊
No,no,please

291
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:39,233
有爪痕
Claw marks

292
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:42,049
是啊 警察说所有的猫都不见了

咱们对付的是个蛇精
We're dealing with some sort of a snake monster

295
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:46,349
今天成了猫咪杀手
Today it's a killer kitty

296
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,314
我不知道
I don't know

297
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,179

Hey

298
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,992
这个小家伙怎么这么眼熟
Why does that mutt look familiar

299
00:13:58,218 --> 00:13:59,871
它是那个标本制作商的狗
That was the taxidermist's dog

300
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,984
所以 两处犯罪现场它都在
So he's been at both crime scenes

301
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,586
对
Yeah

302
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:06,846
也许它是嫌疑犯
Maybe it's a suspect

303
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:08,582
也许
Well,may

304
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,323
可能是化兽人 或许是变形怪
Could be a skinwalker,maybe a shapeshifter

305
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,478
我看不像
Doesn't really look like a monster to me

306
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,958
有办法试出来
One way to find out

307
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:20,760
嗨
Hi,boy

乖哈 不会痛的
This isn't gonna hurt at all

310
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,316
除非你被伤到
Unless it hurts

311
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,909
这么说
Guess we can

312
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,312
可以排除凶手了
Rule out killer

313
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,845
你们还需要帮助吗
You agents need any further assistance

314
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,065
警官 我们现在不需要 谢谢

随时可以找我
Let me know

316
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,438
警官 打扰一下
Officer,excuse me

317

祝收养成功

319
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,254
这么说
So

320
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,190
Colonel不是嫌疑犯
The Colonel is not a suspect

321
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,630
它是目击证人
Maybe a witness

322
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,619
嘿 你懂手语吗
Hey boy,you speak sign language

323
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,733

324
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,686
这样吧
You know what

325
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:25,676
说出来可能很不可思议
This is gonna sound crazy

326
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,366
我读过一本书 讲一个男的
I read this book once about this guy

327
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,056
在一只狗目击一场凶杀案后

00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:32,536
成功了吗
It worked

331
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:33,631
没有
No

332

但是他还是写书了
But he wrote a book about it

333
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,473
没错 他没有我们手上的资源
Yeah,he didn't have what we have

334
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:38,658
Kevin 是我

也有爱斯基摩人

我们就能读懂Colonel的思想了

看起来不算太糟

所以说 这咒语是有副作用的
So,apparently the Inuit spell has some side effects

428
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,158
我喝之前怎么不说
Oh,it'd have been nice to know before I downed it

429
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,460
什么副作用
What kind of side effects

430
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,811
你跟动物思想融合的时候
When you mind meld with an animal,it's

431
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,831
有可能会表现出 该动物的习性
Possible to start exhibiting some of its behavior

432
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,278
别看我啊 Hoss

433
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:14,562
又不是我的错
It ain't my fault

434
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,087
我还有多久会想
How long am I gonna have the urge to

435
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:19,678
闻屁屁
Sniff butts

436
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,995
我才不想闻
I don't have the urge to sniff butts

437
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,150
现在不想
Yet

438

-你真的想 -没有

440
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,883
Kevin也不知道咒语会持续多久
Kevin doesn't know how long it'll last

441
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,289
你也知道 这不属于科学领域
It's not like it's exact science,you know

442
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,800
希望咒语失效之后
But hopefully when the spell wears off

443
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:40,877
副作用也随之而去
So will the side effects

444
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,186
我要是你 我就不吃
I wouldn't eat that if I were you

445
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,336
你真打算吃巧克力整死自己吗
Chocolate?Seriously

446
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,286
我们去哪儿
Where we headed

447
00:21:00,564 --> 00:21:01,609
回收留中心去
Back to the shelter

448
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:04,099
闻线索吗
To sniff out more clues

449
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,485
还是挖漏掉的信息
Maybe dig up something we missed

450
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:08,278
你要再说犬界的双关
All right,one more doggy pun out of you

451
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:09,643
我就把你阉了
And I'm gonna have your nuts clipped

452
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:10,762
我不得不跟你说实话
I hate to break it to you

453
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,597
我已经寂寞空虚很久了
My sack's emptier than Santa's after Christmas

454
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,866
玩儿我呢吗
Oh,are you kidding me

455
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,476
滚开 蠢鸽子
Hey,dick move,pigeon

456
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,411
去死吧 脑残
Screw you,asshat

457
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:25,928
-它 -怎么了
-Did -What

458
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,350
等等 我是不是能听懂所有动物的话
Wait a minute,can I hear all animals

459
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:31,727
对啊 动物界的有通用语言
Yup,animals have a universal language

460
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,607
就像世界语
Like esperanto

461
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,043
这只就碰上了
But this one actually caught on

462
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,171
我才刚刚开始
And I'm just getting started,too

463
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,523
我要来个大的
Brewing a real big one

464
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,144
你的车过后肯定像糊了一层奶油一样白
Bet your ride's gonna look sweet in white

465
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:42,869
-它在说什么 -你
-What's he saying -You

466
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,821
这鸽子脑子有问题
He's being a douchebag

467
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:47,175
你说谁脑子有问题 脑残
Who you calling douchebag,douchebag

468
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,948
闭嘴 你这带翅膀的老鼠
Oh,shut it,you winged rat

469
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:50,180
-哥啊 -干什么
-Dude -What

470
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:51,251
你就 冷静一下
Just...calm down

471
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:52,180
上车吧
Just get in the car

472
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,634
哈哈 对啊 
Ha,that's right,Sally

473
00:21:54,723 --> 00:21:55,920
找妈妈哭去吧
Go cry to mama

474
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,085
够了 你这狗娘养的
That's it,you son of a bitch

475
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:58,612
Dean 快进车里
Ooh!Dean!Hey!Get in the car

476
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,396
我想把Colonel留在车里会比较好吧
I think it's probably best to just leave Colonel in the car

477
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,789
你说什么
Excuse me

478
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:22,996
窗户都是开着的
All the windows are open

479
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,037
你觉得我们喜欢那样吗
You think we like that

480
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:27,296
我们
We

481
00:22:27,918 --> 00:22:29,490
你觉得就因为窗户是开的
You think because the windows are open

482
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:31,087
这就算是某种款待了是吗
That that's some sort of a treat,huh

483
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,354
狗跟我们一起进去
No,the dog's coming in

484
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:34,459
别那么冲
Respect

485
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,999
长得不错
Yeah,baby

486
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,765
没错
You said it

487
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,503
Dean
Dean

488
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:08,450
关于那个戴牛仔帽的男人
So,what else can you tell me 

489
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:09,826
你还知道些什么
About the man with the cowboy hat

490
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,390
说实话 我看到的不多
Honestly,I couldn't see much

491
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,663
可恶的白内障
Damn cataracts

492
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:16,295
还没有人付我的手术费
And you know no one's going to pay for my surgery

493
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:19,485
只不过又是一起伤亡而已
Just another casualty of the system I guess

494
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,178
我不属于这里
I don't belong here,you know

495
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:22,647
我是纯种的
I'm pedigreed

496
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,723
我相信你很快就会出去的
Well,I'm sure you'll be out of here soon

497
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:27,171
别逗了 我都14岁了
Please,I'm 14

498
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:30,842
祝好运
Good luck...Ma'am

499
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:36,568
他们每天都要清理一次
Once the day they clean these cages

500
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:38,427
-每天一次 -好吧
-Once a day -Okay

501
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:41,150
我要吃饼干
Biscuit,Just one biscuit

502

我还在摇
Still shaking the fence

505
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,535
-我在这 -我是被陷害的
-Over here -I was framed

506
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:51,876
有发现吗
Any luck

507
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:53,563
基本没有
Hardly

508
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:54,870
没有任何线索 
I'm not getting any clues 

509
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,400
只是一堆抱怨
Just bunch of complaints

510
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:58,345
嘿 帅哥 过来
Hey,pretty boy.Over here

I'm done for the day

513
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,002
但是我什么都看见了
But I saw everything

514
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,905
我可以告诉你们 只是
And I'll tell you,but

515
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,888
不是免费的
It'll cost you

516
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,309
开什么玩笑
Wait,you kidding me

517
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:13,550
我要被一只狗敲诈了
I'm being extorted by a dog

518
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:14,573
你要什么

519
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,936
要什么 希望被带走 还是要品牌世佳的食物
What?Beggin' strips?Snausages

520
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,882
那是婊子才要的好吗 如果我要告密揭发某人
Bitch please.If I'm gonna rat someone out

521
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:22,750
就必须是让我觉得值得的事
It's got to be worth my while

522
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:25,682
我要 挠肚子
I want...a belly rub

523
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,384
好吧
You...all right

524
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,282
不是你挠
Not from you,sweetie

525
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:33,016

牛仔帽 皮裤
A cowboy hat,leather pants

528
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:43,207
这家伙肯定是还没出柜
Dude's a totally closet case

529
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,495
除了他的衣着 还有
Okay,what else can you tell me about the guy

530
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,036
其他什么吗
Other than...his outfit

531
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,669
他给猫带了一个粗麻袋 
He was carrying a burlap sack for the cats

532
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,924
他要猫干什么的
What does he want with the cats

533
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:54,624
真舒服 我怎么知道 但是他把猫全带走了
Atta boy.Hell if I know,but he took all of them

534
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,590
有一只被他吃了
Except for the one he ate

535
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,125
什么
What

536
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,838
我们要找的凶手牙口不错
Apparently our guy's a sweet tooth

537
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,897
小猫咪都不在话下
For kitty cats

538
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:06,949
麻袋上面有写字
And the sack had something written on it

539
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,484
上面写的什么
Okay,what did it say

540
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:13,025
喂 我们说好的
Hey,come on,we had a deal

541
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,350
你跟这大个子说说
Well,you tell that to the tall drink

542
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,661
是他先停下的
He's the one who stopped rubbing

543
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,301
Sam
Sam

544
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:19,425
我手都抽筋了
Hand cramps

545
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:20,351
它不吭声了
She's not talking

546
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:25,191
这就对了
Atta boy

547
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:29,747
上面写着前卫餐厅 你走运了
It said Avant-Garde Cuisine.Lucky for you

548
00:25:29,748 --> 00:25:31,673
我看得懂法语
I read French

549
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,413
那是主街道上的一家餐厅
That's a cafe on Main Street

550
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:35,913
宠物不得入内
No dogs allowed

551
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,843
怪不得他身上有汉堡包味道和洗洁精的味道
No wonder he smelled like hamburgers and dish soap

552
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,914
我们要进城一趟了
So,we got to go downtown

553
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:41,798
显然我们要找的人在餐厅里工作
Apparantly our guy works at a restaurant

554
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:43,705
嗯
Yeah

555
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,660
等等等
Wait,wait,wait

556
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:47,646
你们确定不收养我吗
Sure you don't want to adopt me

557
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:48,910
不需要 谢谢
No thanks.We'll pass

558
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,613
别走 我不会舔脚的
No,I'm not above licking feet

559
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:52,822
嘿 大个子 回来
Hey,big'un,come back here

560
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:54,005

00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:55,163
等等
Hey hold up

562
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:56,813

What's the matter

563
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:59,114
我试过的最舒服的挠挠
Best belly rub I ever had

564
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,805
自由啦
Freedom

565
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:11,149
我给动物管理中心留了个惊喜
I left a superise in there for animal control

566
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,734
我不知道你还是个傻子
I didn't peg you for a softy

567
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,173
回家了回家了
Going home,I'm going home

568
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:15,569
宝贝儿我回来了
Honey I'm coming home

569
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,144
回家了
Yeah,I'm coming home

570
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:19,762
烟肉 烟肉 烟肉
Bacon!Bacon!Bacon!Bacon

571
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:46,505
我想问
I'm sorry

572
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:49,429
谁家这么有钱 星期一都不营业
Who can afford to be closed on Monday these days

573
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,876
-杀人的疯子 -对
-A homicide maniac -Yeah

574
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:53,121
这边
Hey

575
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,613
看
Check this out

576
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,016
Leo警长
Chef Leo

577
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:13,451
是他吗
Think he's our guy

578
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:15,317
这里是乡下
It's okie town

579
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,099
很多男的都戴牛仔帽
Lots of dudes were cowboy hats

580
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:33,535
羟可酮 曲马多 美沙酮
Oh,oxycodone,tramadol,methadone

581
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:33,535
注 均有止痛的功效

582
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:35,749
看来他喜欢舒舒服服的麻木着
Guess he likes to cook comfortably numb

583
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,935
嗯 对
Yeah,apparently

584
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,176
-救命 -请救救我们 先生
-Help us -Please mister

585
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:40,675
在这里
Over here

586
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:41,870
你听到了吗
Did you hear that

587
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:46,300
好像小孩儿的声音
Sound like little kids

588
00:27:48,728 --> 00:27:50,546
救命 如果你不救我们
Help!If you don't free us

589
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,732
-主厨会吃了我们的 -它说的是真的
-The chef will eat us -She's not lying

590
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,743
我们在笼子里
We're in the cage

591
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,963
吃了你们
Eat you

592
00:28:00,964 --> 00:28:03,411
看看你身后的冰箱
Look at the refrigerator behind you

593
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,502
是的 在你身后
Yeah,behind you

594
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:05,886
在冰箱里
In the fridge

595
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:10,992
嘿
Hey

596
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,376
猫头鹰脑袋
Owl brains

597
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:14,578
猎豹肝脏
Cheetah liver

598
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,042
灰熊心脏
Grizzly heart

599
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:18,614
咒语书
A spell book

600
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:20,178
萨满教
Shamanism

601
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,875
主厨要用巫术来干嘛
What's the chef doing dabbling with witchcraft

602
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,147
这里写着 不管你吃下动物的任何器官
It says here,whatever animal organs you ingest 

603
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:27,755
正确地混合巫毒和香料
With the right mix of hoo doo and spices

604
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:30,129
你就能暂时获得该动物的能力
You temporarily gain the power of that animal

605
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,357
那么
So,okay

606
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,145
如果你吃了猫头鹰大脑
If you're munching on owl brains

607
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,809
你的脑袋就能转的跟驱魔人一样了
Your head spins around like The Exorcist

608
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:36,757
差不多
Close

609
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,539
可以让你的IQ激增
Bolsters your IQ,okay

610
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,597
吃下猎豹肝脏就能获得速度
Eat a cheetah liver for speed

611
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,186
灰熊心脏获得力量
Bear heart for strength

612
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:45,784
如果他吃了这些东西
Okay,so if he's chowing down on this stuff

613
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:46,872
这样就能解释
Then it'd make sense,why he

614
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,383
他为什么会勒死标本制作商
Constricted the taxidermist 

615
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:50,532
还挠死了收留中心的那个家伙
And clawed the guy in the shelter

616
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:54,285
别见怪 为什么会有人想吃你们呢
Oh,no offense,but why do we want to eat you guys

617
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:56,802
-呃 我们脊椎可折叠 -是啊 相信我们
-Uh,we have collapsable spine -We do,promise

618
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:57,856
看看这里
Look at this

619
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,541
狮子肝脏加上鹰的心脏
Lion liver plus eagle heart

620
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,865
响尾蛇的獠牙加上蟒蛇的膀胱
Rattlesnake fangs plus anaconda bladder

621
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:05,693
他在混合各种器官
He's mixing ingredients

622
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:10,911
小声点
Shoo!Quiet

623
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:13,111
别嘘我 你安静点
Don't shush me!You be quiet

624
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,294
我很安静
I am quite.Now

625
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:37,296
你们是谁
Who the hell are you

626
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:38,759
我们是卫生局的
We're from the health department

627
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:40,235
过来检查卫生
Stopped by for an inspection

628
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,470
我不知道我们有安排检查
I wasn't aware we had one scheduled

629
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,572
是的 没有 这才是重点
Yeah,no,you wouldn't be,that's the point

630
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,328
不是说你们下班了吗
Besides,I thought you're closed

631
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,190
下班了呀 不过主厨在进行私人就餐
We are,Chef's having a private dinner

632
00:29:49,191 --> 00:29:51,161
事实上 他随时会过来的
In fact,he'll be here in any minute

633
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:53,875
那好吧 既然这样
Oh,well then,in that case

634
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,081
关闭厨房
Kitchen's shut down

635
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:57,292
关闭 为什么
Shut down?Why

636
00:29:57,293 --> 00:30:01,453
因为你们都违反了刑法第八章第十四项条例
Because you're both in clear violation of penal code 8.14

637
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,343
出去 快点
Out,come on,get out

638
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,518
都给我出去
Both of you

639
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:09,727
有什么事儿会通知你们的
We'll let you know

640
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:15,556
好了 我去前门 你去后门
All right,I take the front,you take the back

641
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:16,974
我们都不知道怎么杀死这家伙
We don't even know how to kill this guy

642
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:18,700
朝他脑袋开一枪
Empty one of these in his head

643
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:20,422
看看怎么样
See what that does

644
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,636
变色龙 味道也不坏
Chameleons,aren't that bad

645
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:05,360
尝起来有点像鸡肉
Kind of taste like chicken

646
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:33,172
你是怎么做到的
How the hell did you do that

647
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,923
-做什么 -别装了
-Do what? -Don't play coy

648
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:38,725
我想知道你是什么
I wanna know what you are

649
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,800
去他的章鱼鲨
Oh,screw the sharktopus

650
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:47,509
你是我的主菜
You're my main course

651
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:10,884
为什么这里有狗的味道
Why does it smell like dog in here

652
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:17,270
味道是从你身上来的
That smell's coming from you

653
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,658
所有的狗都应该被系上项圈拴起来
All dog should be leashed

654
00:32:45,202 --> 00:32:46,515
你对我弟弟做了什么
What did you do to my brother

655
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:49,891
你弟弟吗
Your brother

656
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:52,937
你妈妈怀你们俩的时候
What was your mom smoking 

657
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,329
到底磕了什么药
When she had you two

658
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:55,229
他没事
He's fine

659
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,591
只是在晚饭前小憩一下罢了
He's just taking a little cat-nap before dinner

660
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,507
我从没吃过人类心脏
I've never had human heart before

661
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:00,742
听说挺难嚼的
Heard it's a bit chewy

662
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:02,724
幸好我不怎么挑食
Good job I'm not a fussy eater

663
00:33:05,955 --> 00:33:07,019
你绝对是有病
You're sick

664
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,687
经常有人这么说
Told that once or twice

665
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:12,575
不不 不是指你心理变态
No,no,not in the head I

666
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,085
呃 你确实有点儿变态
Well,you're that,too,but

667
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:18,024
但我说的是 像癌症那种病
I mean sick like cancer

668
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:23,712
看来狗真的什么都闻得出来
Oh,I guess dog really can sniff it out

669
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:26,610
癌症第四期
Stage four carcinoma

670
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,464
所以你才做了这些事
So that's why you're doing this

671
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:32,534
发生什么事了
What happened

672
00:33:32,535 --> 00:33:35,003
倒霉到家 决定放手一搏吗
Draw a short straw,decided to break bed

673
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,619
当我被确诊的时候
So when I was diagnosed

674
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,079
正常的治疗过程已经无法治好我了
I was way past standard treatment

675
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,751
没人能救我
No one could save me

676
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:44,344
但是有了个波尼族萨满的帮助
But then with a help of a Pawnee Shaman

677
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:46,330
以及一张动物园年卡 我找到了疗法
And a zoo membership,I found a cure

678
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:49,272
只是暂时性的
Would be the temporally one

679
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:52,102
癌症总会复发
Cancer always came back

680
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:56,679
所以你开始用各种器官做实验吗
You're starting experimenting with different organs,huh

681
00:33:56,772 --> 00:33:59,523
给自己混了一大盘子肉当解药吃是吗
Taking a single serving for a combo platter

682
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:00,461
我还能说什么呢
What can I say

683
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:02,324
结合各种疗法是有效的
Combination therapy works

684
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:06,770
我变得更强壮 而且效果
I felt stronger,and the effect

685
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:09,070
持续很长
Lasted longer

686
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:12,484
所以你就觉得自己可以随意杀人了是吗
And if you smoke a few innocent people in the process

687
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,425
哦没错 因为你自我感觉超级良好
Well hell,at least you felt better

688
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:17,752
我没想杀人的
I didn't mean to kill anyone

689
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:19,908
本来没想杀
At first

690
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:22,124
但如果有人挡了我的路
But if people got in my way

691
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,194
他们就变成了附带损害品
They became collateral damage

692
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:28,063
我猜你干掉的猎食者已经够多了
Guess you've eaten enough predators

693
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:29,478
多到自己也开始变成猎食者了
Start to become one

694
00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:33,269
人如其食 对吧
You're what you eat,right

695
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:38,016
即使你真的通过这样的方式 获得了别人的力量
You really think the power you hold over people's lives

696
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:40,490
也无法弥补你本身的缺陷
Can make up for what you lack in your own

697
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,146
那么 狗崽子
So,dog boy

698
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:52,717
我要吃下什么才能打倒你呢
What do I need to eat to take you down

699
00:34:58,669 --> 00:34:59,869
你不会想这么做的
You don't wanna do this

700
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:02,279
哦 但我确实想这么做
Oh,but I do want to do this

701
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,140
看 我会杀了你
See,I'm gonna kill you

702
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,084
引起食欲
Work up a nice appetite

703
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:11,578
然后 我会吃了你弟弟
And then,I'm gonna eat your brother

704
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,212
虽然我不知道他到底是什么东西
I mean I don't know what the hell he is

705
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:18,829
但是 有那么强大的治愈能力
But with healing powers like that

706
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,286
谁在乎呢
Who cares

707
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,084
我要他治愈的能力
He could cure me

708
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:33,724
犬科
Dog on

709
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:35,907
都差不多
Sort of dog

710
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:26,413
抱歉 狼胜过狗
Sorry,wolf trumps dog

711
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,065
可能吧 但不能胜过一群狗
Maybe,but not a whole pack

712
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:13,245
嘿
Hey

713
00:37:13,954 --> 00:37:14,742
看在上帝份上
For the love of God

714
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:15,326
Sammy
Sammy

715
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:17,478
Sammy
Sammy

716
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:20,540
Zeke
Zeke

717
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:23,820
你们俩随便谁赶紧给我醒一个
Whoever the hell you are

718
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:25,402
嘿 快醒醒
Hey,Come on

719
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,643
别逼我舔你脸
Don't make me lick your damn face

720
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:31,656
嘿
Hey

721
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:41,222
来吧
Come on

722
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,190
你给我们打电话说领养的事的时候
When you called us about adopting

723
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,085
我们不能相信
We couldn't believe it

724
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:47,917
你真是个小甜甜
Aren't you a sweet ass

725
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,042
离远点 愚蠢的人类
Back off,tofu breathe

726
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:52,725
你一定饿坏了
You must be starving

727
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:56,179
你很幸运 我烤了一些培根狗狗蛋糕
Lucky for you,I baked some bacon doggy cupcake

728
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:04,262
我跟着这两个人 会拉出芽草的
I'm gonna be pooping wheatgrass with this two

729
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:07,289
看 我知道他们是嬉皮士怪胎
Look,I know they are hippie freaks

730
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,452
但他们能给你一个好家
But they are going to give you a good home

731
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,410
那是你应得的
One you deserve

732
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,734
是啊 是啊
Yeah,yeah

733
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:14,926
真希望能带你上路 但是
Wish we could take you on the road with this,but

734
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:16,826
那不是给狗的好生活
It's no life for a dog

735
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:18,420
算了吧
Don't sweat it

736
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:19,930
反正我晕车
I got car sick anyway

737
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,908
我之前没敢告诉你
I was afraid to tell you earlier

738
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:23,837
我吐你车后座上了
But I barfed in your back seat

739
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:24,500
你
You

740
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:27,121
怎么了
What

741
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,265
我会想你的 伙计
I'm gonna miss you,buddy

742
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:34,245
我也会想你的
I'll miss you,too

743
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:35,432
顺便说一下
And by the way 

744
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:38,337
作为一个具有狗的荣誉称号的人 你应该知道
As an honorary dog,there is something you should know

745
00:38:38,723 --> 00:38:41,006
狗其实不是人类最好的朋友
Dogs aren't really man's best friend

746
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:42,512
你说什么呢
What are you talking about

747
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,952
我知道这听起来像是阴谋论者的论调
I know it sounds like a conspiracy theory

748
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:47,516
但是我们在这里的真正原因是
But the real reason we were put here was to

749
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,211
是什么
Put here to do what

750
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,598
开什么玩笑
Oh,you got to be kidding me

751
00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:58,897
咒语现在失效了
Now the spell wears off

752
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,227
好吧
Okay

753
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:14,798
怎么样
How did it go

754
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:19,637
坏消息是 我会想那个家伙的
Well,bad news is I'm gonna miss the flea bag

755
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:22,806
好消息是 咒语终于失效了
Good news is it looks like the spell finally wears off

756
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:26,488
你还好吧
You okay

757
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,063
那凶手把你揍得挺惨
The Stetson man got you pretty good

758
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:30,561
是啊 我很好
Yeah,I'm fine

759
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,703
我就是
I just

760
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,202
我在想他说的话 没法停下
I can't stop thinking what he said

761
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,844
算了吧 Sammy
Come on,Sammy

762
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,199
那货脑子有泡
The guy was out of his freaking gourd

763
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:42,009
是 但是 我是说 为什么
Yeah,but,I mean why

764
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:43,508
他为什么会那么问
Why would he asked that

765
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,428
为什么想知道我是什么
Why did he wanna know what I was

766
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:47,976
谁知道呢
Who the hell knows

767
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:50,835
他整个人都不正常
He's all jacked up on juice you know

768
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:53,273
他被他不能控制的东西附身了
He was possessed by something he couldn't control

769
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:53,801
那是
It was

770
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:03,761
失控只是时间问题
It's a matter of time before it completely took over

771
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:09,874
你不能跟疯子讲道理 是吧
You can't reason with crazy,right

772
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:12,933
我不知道
I don't know

773
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,452
我知道
Well,I do

774
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:17,501
相信我 Sammy 你没什么可担心的
Trust me,Sammy,you got nothing to worry about
