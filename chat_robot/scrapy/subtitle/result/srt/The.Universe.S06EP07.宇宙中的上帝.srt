1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,371
上溯至宇宙初始  周遭还只是一片漆黑
In the beginning, there was darkness.

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:03,881
不知何时  忽地一声巨响
And then-- Bang!

3
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:06,643
时间空间以及物质皆由此发端
Giving birth to an endless, expanding existence

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,985
此后不断膨胀  延伸  永无止境
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:12,227
每一天  新的发现都在不断为我们解开
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

6
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:14,679
蕴藏于这里的那些神秘莫测
the mysterious, the mind-blowing,

7
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,911
令人大开眼界  致命的秘密
the deadly secrets of a place we call

8
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:18,911
我们称这个地方为"宇宙"
the universe.

9
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,014
审视地球难以置信的复杂多样性
Looking at the Earth's incredible complexity,

10
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:28,567
人类一直想要探寻其形成的原因
people have always wondered what made it all possible.

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,492
物理方程式是如何发挥作用的
What breathed fire into the equations of physics.

12
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:38,274
长期以来  宗教对此有精神阐释
Religion has long offered a spiritual explanation,

13
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:41,076
认为上帝创造了整个宇宙
that God created the universe.

14
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:45,919
目前的科学是否找到上帝存在的蛛丝马迹
But is science now starting to find elusive evidence of God

15
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,593
物理学能否证明我们根本就不需要造物者
or does physics tell us that no creator was necessary?

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,835
史蒂芬・霍金和我在《大设计》中写道
Stephen Hawking and I say in the book, The Grand Design,

17
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,886
宇宙的形成可能是一个从无到有的过程
that the universe could have come from nothing.

18
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:03,531
让我们开始在宇宙中进行对上帝的科学探索
Let's embark on a scientific search for God in the universe.

整个宇宙其实非常狂暴
The universe can be a very violent place.

诞生了超凡脱俗之物

诞生了有意识情感的生命

34

宇宙中为何会出现智慧生命的原因
It is, of course, a mystery to why the universe exists

另许多人倍感惊奇的是
Some people marvel at the fact that

44
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:18,210
宇宙拥有几百亿年的历史
the universe has over billions of years,

45

诞出能够领会其复杂性的生命
giving birth to beings who can appreciate its complexity.

46
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:29,207
我们现在甚至开始思索  人类从何而来
We can even ponder where and how we fit in.

47

英语里称作天穹
And we call this, in English, a firmament,

53
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:55,464
恒星和行星即悬在那里
and in the firmament is where all the stars and planets were hung.

54
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,806
所有的古代文明相信
Almost all ancient cultures believed

55
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:02,299
他们所在的宇宙都是在这样的一个弯顶下
their universe existed in a dome similar to this one.

56
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,331
他们从没质疑过谁是造物主的问题
And they never questioned who created it.

57
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:11,264
古人认定是上帝或者诸神
The ancients assumed that there was a God or gods

58
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:15,938
创造并维持了宇宙
responsible for the creation and the maintenance of the universe.

59
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,189
上帝创造了宇宙这一观点
The idea that God created the universe

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,852
直到中世纪才遭到质疑
went largely unchallenged until the Middle Ages,

61
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,414
当时的科学家根据他们的观察
when scientists made a sacrilegious suggestion,

62
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,386
提出了亵渎神明的想法
based on their observations--

63
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,519
宇宙的中心不是地球  而是太阳
The Sun, not the Earth, was at the center of the universe.

64
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,891
人类的思维模式发生了改变
There was a paradigm shift.

65
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:41,825
产生了解释我们周围自然现象的新方式
There is now another way to explain the natural occurring phenomena around us,

66
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,635
而这就是科学
and this is science.

67
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:46,747
从中世纪开始
Since the Middle Ages,

68
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,829
科学家们发展出了许多复杂的新理论
scientists have developed sophisticated new theories

69
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,552
以描述宇宙的宏大以及地球所处的位置
about the enormity of the universe and our place in it,

70
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:57,245
在这些理论中往往都没有上帝的立足之地
theories that often have no room for God.

71
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:03,499
许多现象曾对人类来说非常神秘
Many phenomena have appeared mysterious or miraculous or magical,

亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

73
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,200
而通过科学研究
and then through the process of science,

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,981
人类慢慢开始理解这些现象
we've eventually understood them.

75
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:11,353
科学家们慢慢意识到  太阳仅仅是
Scientists gradually realized that the Sun really is just one star

76
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:15,066
巨大的星系中的一颗恒星
among a multitude of stars in a gigantic galaxy

77
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,878
而这个星系拥有数以亿计颗类似恒星
having hundreds of billions of such stars.

78
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:23,091
所有这一切都始于137亿年前的一次大爆炸
And all this was created in a Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago.

79
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,765
尽管科学理论  科学观察和实验
But while scientific theories, observations, and experiments

80
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:31,287
告诉我们人类在宇宙中的位置
tell us where we are in the cosmos,

81
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,708
它们仍未回答两个永恒的问题
they don't answer the eternal questions:

82
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,669
即人类产生的原因
Why we are here

83
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,031
若有造物主  它又是谁
and who, if anyone, created us.

84
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:44,325
一些物理学家继续探索这些问题的答案
So some physicists continue to search for those answers.

85
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:47,207
他们的发现十分惊人
What they're finding is extraordinary.

86
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:53,281
隐藏的非凡秩序支配着整个宇宙
A remarkable unseen order that may govern the universe.

87
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:59,866
人类为自然世界之美所倾倒
We're all struck by the beauty and majesty of the natural world, about us,

88
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:06,659
树木 天空 还有日落之美
the trees, the sky and the beauty of a sunset.

89
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,231
如此神奇  如此壮观
It is awesome and it's majesty.

90
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,993
我们如何才能了解这一切呢
How can we make sense of it all?

91
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:16,346
我们需要了解自然的潜台词
We need to look at the hidden subtext of nature,

92
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,508
也就是支持这个世界的数学关系
the mathematical relationships that underpin it,

93
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,429
形成某种影子世界
forming a sort of shadow world.

94
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:23,060
有人将其视作宇宙密码
Some people think of this as a cosmic code.

95
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:27,923
不管这些科学家是不是信仰上帝
Regardless of whether or not they believe in God,

96
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:33,658
他们大多承认宇宙密码的存在
most scientists agree the cosmic code appears to exist.

宇宙中的万物
Everything in the universe

99
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:43,684
都由自然的基本相互作用力支配着
is determined by the fundamental forces of nature.

100
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:48,047
这些作用力以数字为特征  称为
The strength of those forces are characterized by numbers, called

101
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,519
基本常数  它们如此敏感
"Fundamental constants" that are so sensitive

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,031
只要稍有改变
that if they changed by just a little bit,

103
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,622
我们所知的宇宙就不复存在了
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't be here.

104
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:02,526
譬如说  如果大爆炸之后宇宙的膨胀率
For example, if the rate of expansion of the universe right

105
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,869
有一万兆分之一的改变
after the Big Bang had changed by one part in a quintillion--

106
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,812
解释一下  1万兆就是1后面有18个零
a quintillion is one with 18 zeros after it--

107
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:13,473
宇宙将可能会持续膨胀
the universe would continue to expand...

108
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:17,156
或者坍塌回去
or collapse back on itself...

109
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,968
现在的一切都不复存在
And none of this would be possible.

110
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:26,081
为了说明一万兆分之一有多小
To illustrate just how small a number one part in a quintillion is,

111
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:29,214
你们可以想象一下这片沙滩上的沙粒
imagine all the grains of sand on this beach,

112
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:33,577
或者  想象地球上所有沙滩上所有的沙粒
in fact, imagine all the grains of sand in all the world's beaches.

113
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:36,819
沙粒总数大概在一万兆左右
That number's probably somewhere around a quintillion.

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,812
以此类推  假使沙粒总数代表的是
In this analogy, if all that sand represents the rate of

115
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,653
大爆炸之后宇宙的膨胀率
expansion of the universe right after the Big Bang,

116
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:49,306
若想破坏整个宇宙  须改变多少沙粒呢
how many grains of sand would I need to add or subtract to wreck the Universe?

117
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:55,981
仅仅一颗  一万兆分之一
Just one grain, one in a quintillion--

118
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,154
宇宙出现的要求就是如此分毫不差
that's how precise things had to be for us to be here.

119
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,679
即使这次大爆炸范围分毫不差
But even though the Big Bang was perfectly calibrated,

120
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,301
如果物质平均延伸至整个宇宙
intelligent life would never have formed,

121
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:14,824
智慧生命也无法形成
if matter had spread evenly across the universe.

122
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:20,898
如果完全均匀  就不会产生任何结块
Had it been perfectly smooth, then there wouldn't be any clumps,

123
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:23,999
就不可能相互吸引并形成恒星和星系
which would gravitate and form stars and galaxies.

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,871
因此在宇宙中
So, we needed slight irregularities

125
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:29,503
物质的分布要有些许不均
in the distribution of matter in the universe.

126
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:32,835
若物质分布更加均匀
Had those irregularities been much smaller,

127
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,257
恒星和星系就不可能形成
stars and galaxies wouldn't have formed.

128
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,248
若分布过于不均
Had they been much larger,

129
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,440
一切物质会塌缩成一个黑洞
everything would have collapsed to form black holes.

130
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:46,274
即使整个宇宙中的物质分布恰到好处
But even with the right distribution of matter throughout the universe,

131
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:50,027
没有恒星内部一系列复杂过程
life would still never have formed

132
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,820
生命也不会形成
without a complex series of processes inside stars

133
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,701
这个过程即是将氦和氢
that converted helium and hydrogen

134
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,283
转化成更重的元素
into heavier elements, like carbon

135
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:03,526
譬如形成所有生物的基本元素  碳
that formed the bases of all living beings.

136
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,528
其中一些恒星爆炸
Some of those stars explode,

137
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,040
为新生恒星  行星以及最终的生命
providing raw material with which to form new stars,

138
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,821
提供了原材料
planets, and, ultimately, life.

139
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:15,984
如果物理定律有些许不同
Had the laws of physics been a little bit different,

140
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,975
甚至是物理常数跟实际
or even if physical constants had been a little bit different

141
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,136
有些许差别
from what they really are,

142
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:24,469
核聚变的过程以及恒星爆炸
this process of nuclear fusion and the explosion of stars

143
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,340
都不会发生
might not have been possible,

144
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,892
我们也就不可能站在这讨论这个问题
and we wouldn't be here discussing it.

145
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:34,475
我从没见过任何科学家会否认
I don't know a single scientist who would disagree with the statement

146
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,547
这个世界无比精妙这个说法
that the world is exceedingly ingenious...

147
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,110
不仅是数学意义上的  不仅美丽优雅
Not just mathematical, not just beautiful, not just elegant,

148
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:44,332
这是对无与伦比之事物的完美诠释
but the manifestation of something truly extraordinary.

149
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:49,916
宇宙这种非凡的至臻之极
How could this extraordinary fine-tuning of the universe

150
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:55,580
怎能不是神圣造物主存在的确切证据呢
be anything less than unmistakable evidence of a divine creator.

151
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,714
人们说这种至臻之极绝对证明了
It's often said that the delicate fine-tuning

152
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:06,066
存在某种力量精心调配出这一切
must be evidence that some agency tuned it that way.

153
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:12,241
但大多数物理学家都持不同看法
Most physicists' take on this is actually not to go in that direction.

154
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:15,372
如果你再物理学中发现经过精密调整的事物
When you see something that's finely tuned in physics,

155
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:18,454
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

156
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,074
这往往意味着
it usually means there's a mechanism

157
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:19,366
有尚未知晓的机制
that you don't yet understand

158
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,397
在当中发挥作用
that is playing a role there.

159
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,342
即使看起来像是有位神圣造物主创造了宇宙
So, while it appears a divine creator planned the universe,

160
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:35,295
许多物理学家认为精密调制不能证明其存在
many physicists say apparent fine-tuning doesn't prove anything of the sort.

161
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,527
肯定有其它事物在起作用
Something else must be at work.

162
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,990
但是除了上帝  还有什么事物
But what other than God could possibly explain

163
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,811
能够创造出这一系列非凡的事件
the remarkable series of events

164
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:48,294
最终导致宇宙中生命的诞生
that led to the creation of life in our universe?

165
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:54,078
有种非常流行的理论  听起来似乎
One very popular contender is the idea that seems

166
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,330
跟有神论一样难以置信
at least as incredible as the idea of God.

167
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,962
称之为多宇宙论
It's the multiple-universe theory.

168
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,015
即在广袤的超空间中
A very large number of universes

169
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:06,696
存在数量极多的宇宙
perhaps even an infinite number,

170
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:10,819
这个数量甚至可能是无限的
could, in principle exist in a vast hyperspace.

171
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,161
用一杯啤酒作比喻
We can understand the idea of hyperspace

172
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,733
我们便能理解超空间的概念
by comparing it to a mug of beer.

173
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,895
这个啤酒杯代表的是超空间
The beer mug would be the hyperspace

174
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:22,716
当中的气泡就是单个的宇宙
and the bubbles would be these individual universes.

175
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:26,929
啤酒杯中的气泡外表几乎相同
The bubbles in a beer mug are all physically about the same.

176
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,351
设想一下  它们的属性成分可能不一样
But suppose they span a range of properties.

177
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,824
有一些含有碳  氧
Some of them might have carbon, oxygen

178
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:37,586
恒星和重力  其它的可能没有
and stars and gravity, and others don't.

179
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:42,699
而我们则是其中一个宇宙  富饶  复杂
We would be in one of the ones that leads to a rich, complex universe

180
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,631
最终诞生出生命
combinating with life as we know it.

181
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,675
如果真有无限的宇宙  而这种精密调配
If there are an infinite number of other universes

182
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,947
出现在我们所在的宇宙
the fine tuning that seems to be present in ours

183
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:58,050
与其说上帝的杰作  不如说是统计学定律
isn't an example of God's plan but rather the law of statistics.

184
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,182
大部分宇宙不会自然地向这方面发展
Most of these universes wouldn't naturally develop

185
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,244
并最终孕育出智慧生命
in ways that fostered intelligent life...

186
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,686
只有一小部分会
But a few, would.

187
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:12,649
因此对于我们所处宇宙的特殊性的解释是
So then the explanation for the specialness of the universe

188
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,661
我们是这个巨型宇宙抽奖中的赢家
is that we are winners in a gigantic cosmic lottery.

189
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:18,764
因为在不利于生命存在的宇宙中
It stands to reason that we couldn't be living and discussing this

190
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:21,335
我们无法生存并讨论这个问题
in a universe that was hostile to life,

191
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:25,148
只有生态友善型宇宙中才会产生智能生命
only the bio-friendly ones get populated with thinking beings.

192
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:32,172
多重宇宙论其实是自然和简单的结论
Having a multitude of universes is actually a simple and natural consequence

193
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,254
因为它和我们所处宇宙
of some of the most favorite models

194
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,956
诞生和早期演变的最佳模型不谋而合
for the birth and early evolution of our universe.

195
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:40,117
就像是恒星和行星
It's kind of like stars and planets.

196
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,319
只要有能力制造一个
As long as you have the capacity to make one,

197
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,341
就很容易产生更多
it's easy to make lots of them.

198
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:52,276
但是一些神学家表示多重宇宙论
But some theologians say the idea of an infinite number of universes

199
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,547
没有看不见的造物主论
isn't any more likely than an unseen creator

200
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,280
更有可能保证生命的诞生
ensuring our universe is habitable for life.

201
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,442
相信多重宇宙的存在
A multiverse requires as much belief

202
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:07,144
罗伯特・斯皮策神父
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

203
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:06,254
就如相信上帝一般
as belief in a transcendent God.

204
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:09,206
目前没有证据可以证明其存在
There is simply no evidence for it right now,

205
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:12,138
而且以后也可能很难找到证据
and it may be very difficult to prove it in the future.

206
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:14,619
物理学家保罗・戴维斯说
Physicist Paul Davies said,

207
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:18,102
"若只为解释我们的宇宙是如何产生
"To postulate trillions upon trillions upon trillions of universes,

208
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,714
就贸然假设存在亿万个宇宙
just to explain one like ours

209
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:25,667
无非是给宇宙极端加上负担"
is bringing excess baggage to cosmic extremes."

210
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,121
上帝创世与宇宙学说之间的辩论
This debate about the question of God and the universe

211
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:36,284
可能即将进入最激烈的时期
may soon enter an explosive phase.

212
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:42,308
令人震惊的新理论指出
Startling new theories suggest something could exist

213
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,089
可能有物体存在于另一维度
in an unexplored dimension

214
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,072
并且离我们只有几毫米的距离
just millimeters away from each person on Earth.

215
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:59,949
在宇宙中探寻上帝的热潮愈演愈烈
While the search for God in the universe heats up,

216
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,821
一些科学家正致力于新理论
some scientists are working to develop a theory

217
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:06,174
它被喻为  "物理界的圣杯"
that has been called "The Holy Grail of Physics".

218
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,776
它可以解释宇宙中的一切
A theory that could explain everything in the universe

219
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:12,788
包括它的诞生
including how it started.

220
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,520
这就是弦理论
It's called String Theory.

221
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:21,823
弦理论是目前流行的极有野心的新理论
String Theory is the latest ambitious popular attempt

222
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:26,026
保罗・戴维斯
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

223
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:25,576
它试图将物理界各种分支集为一体
to pull all of the disparate strands of physics together

224
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,028
形成统一的理论
into one grand unified theory.

225
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,192
既然它声称能解释物理界中几乎所有问题
Since it promises to answer nearly every question in physics,

226
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:37,324
那么弦理论是否能告诉我们
will string theory be able to tell us

227
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:39,585
到底是超然的上帝
whether it was a transcendent creator

228
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,117
还是物理学定律
or the laws of physics alone

229
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,899
创造了宇宙呢
that gave birth to the universe?

230
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,432
这让我们达到更深的一个层次
This is getting us one level deeper.

231
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:53,004
每当我们发现新联系时  我们就更深一步
Every time we find new links between things, we go down a level.

232
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:55,196
这令我们距全貌更近一些
It's getting us closer to the total package

233
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:58,458
最终当我们获得宇宙的所有信息时
and when we get that complete description of the universe

234
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,459
就无法再深入了
well, we can't do much better than that.

235
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:05,472
无论弦理论是否指向上帝
Whether or not String Theory leads us to God,

236
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:08,664
它已经指引我们去考虑
it already offers tantalizing suggestions

237
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:13,728
人类尚未发现的维度
about unexplored dimensions that humans have never detected.

238
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,771
弦理论的基本观点是
The basic idea of String Theory

239
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:21,383
宇宙中存在有基础能量单元
is that there are these little fundamental packages of energy.

240
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,813
被称之为闭合弦
You could call them little strings,

241
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:28,497
它们抖动的方式不同  而这种不同
and they vibrate in different ways, and the different modes of vibration

242
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:31,689
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

243
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:31,690
就产生了宇宙中
correspond to the different kinds of fundamental particles

244
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,741
不同的基本粒子
we observe in the universe.

245
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,243
根据理论
According to the theory,

246
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,845
这些无穷小的闭合弦
these infinitesimally small strings

247
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,717
是所有能量和物质的基本单位
are the fundamental building blocks of all energy and matter,

248
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,030
但是该理论的数学基础
but the mathematics behind the theory

249
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,901
却指向了一个惊人的结论
suggests one astounding conclusion.

250
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:54,775
闭合弦不仅需要在三维世界振动
The strings have to vibrate not just in the three dimensions we see,

251
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,867
而且需要在更高维度如此  那么问题便是
but in a larger number. And so this raises a question...

252
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,128
这些额外维度在哪
where are all these extra dimensions?

253
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:06,973
一些物理学家认为  额外维度可能极小
Some physicists believe those extra dimensions may be so small,

254
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,364
人类从未能探测到
we've never been able to detect them.

255
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,827
但是另外一些认为
But others say that some of them

256
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:16,709
它们可能存在于我们的宇宙之外
may lie outside our universe...

257
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,391
在所谓的"体宇宙"中
in a so-called "Bulk universe."

258
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:26,206
很有可能  我们的宇宙
It's quite possible that our universe,

259
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:28,277
一个四维的宇宙
the four easily observed dimensions--

260
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:33,239
只是存在于高维度体宇宙 中的一层"膜宇宙"
is like a membrane within a higher-dimensional bulk.

261
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:38,673
根据理论  高维度体宇宙
In theory, the higher dimensional bulk

262
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,395
可以离我们近在咫尺
could exist just millimeters away from us

263
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,607
因为它在另一维度
because it is in a different dimension.

264
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:47,479
但是为何它近在咫尺人类却从未察觉
But how could things exist so close to us without our knowing?

265
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,751
而这对于上帝
And what might that imply about

266
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,993
是否存在  又有何影响
the existence, or the nonexistence, of God?

267
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:59,397
天文学家劳拉・丹莉将对此做出讲解
Astronomer Laura Danly demonstrates this concept

268
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:05,230
她身处三维世界  有高度  宽度及深度
from her three-dimensional world of height, width, and depth

269
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,613
她将与屏幕中的
by trying to communicate with physicist

270
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:11,394
物理学家亚历克・菲力彭科交流
Alex Filippenko, who's on a television screen

271
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:16,799
他身处二维世界  只有高度和宽度
with just two dimensions-- height and width.

272
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,501
亚历克  亚历克
Alex? Alex?

273
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:26,154
亚历克看不到劳拉  因为他处于二维空间中
Alex can't see Laura because he's trapped in two dimensions.

274
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:30,467
他缺少深度来与劳拉的世界沟通
He has no dimension of depth, that would link him to Laura's world.

275
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:34,250
他无法看见自己的身前或背后
He can't see in front of him and he can't see behind him,

276
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,681
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

277
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,723
因为在他的二维世界中  不存在前后
because in his two-dimensional universe, there is no in front or behind.

278
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:42,385
我却可以看到自己身后
I, on the other hand, can see behind me

279
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,807
以及屏幕中的亚历克
and see Alex on that screen.

280
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,849
她也能听见亚历克说话
And she can also hear what Alex says.

281
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:53,082
如果物理定律局限于
If the laws of physics are constrained to work

282
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,793
某几个维度中
in a certain number of dimensions,

283
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:58,996
那么我们就无法看到  摸到或是感受到
then we can't physically see or touch or experience

284
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:02,879
另一个与这几维度垂直的维度
a dimension that's perpendicular to those dimensions.

285
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,521
假设你所处的宇宙
So, for example, suppose your universe, your hypothetical universe,

286
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:09,653
是这块电视屏幕的表面
was just the surface of this television screen.

287
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,415
你可以上下左右运动
You can go up, down, left and right,

288
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:17,018
或者是这些方向的组合  却无法向里或向外
or any combination of those motions, but you can't go in or out.

289
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:21,511
这个维度可以用数学理论进行描述
That dimension would be a mathematical describable

290
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:24,412
但实际上却无法接触
but physically inaccessible dimension.

291
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:25,983
亚历克
Alex?

292
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:28,445
就如亚历克与劳拉身处一室
Just as Alex can be in the same room as Laura

293
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,487
却无法感知她一样
without being able to see or hear her,

294
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:37,170
我们身边就可能隐藏着永远无法探知的维度
there could be hidden dimensions right beside us that we can never detect.

295
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:44,815
如果上帝或其他神物存在于高维度
If God or other sanction creatures exist in a higher number of dimensions

296
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:46,788
他们便可看见我们
they might be able to see us,

297
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,410
并且接近我们  却不被知晓
and get very close to us without our knowing it.

298
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:56,623
你可以想象或推测  智能生物
You can imagine and speculate that there are intelligent forms

299
00:17:56,624 --> 00:18:00,156
生存于这些高维度空间中
of life that live in these higher-dimensional scenarios

300
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:03,007
对我们的维度产生作用
that we see the effects of somehow in our dimensions,

301
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:08,711
而我们却没有意识到这是生物对世界的影响
and we don't realize that they're actual living agents affecting our lives.

302
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,062
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

303
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:11,773
我想现在的科学无法推翻它
I think right now science can certainly not disprove that.

304
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,895
它也留给了我们很多推测的空间
I think it's-- it's very much in the realm of speculation.

305
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,499
弦理论表示我们的宇宙可能延至其它维度中
String theory predicts that our universe extends into other dimensions,

306
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:24,021
却并未说明其它维度中是否有特定生物
but doesn't predict that anything in particular lives in those other dimensions.

307
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:28,714
没有一个大胡子家伙在创造宇宙
There's no bearded fellow there creating the universe

308
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:30,296
伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
《大设计》合著者

309
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:31,796
或是操控一切
or pulling the strings.

310
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,360
神学家表明
Theologians argue

311
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,922
我们无法按照弦理论所说
we'll never find God in the 11-dimensional reality

312
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:41,643
在十一度空间中找到上帝
predicted by String Theory,

313
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:45,506
因为上帝超越了体宇宙
because he transcends the bulk universe.

314
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:52,190
藏于弦理论提出的十一度空间
Hidden within the 11 dimensions of String Theory

315
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:54,792
已经十分的不凡
is a remarkable amount of fine-tuning...

316
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:58,544
但是藏于在十一度空间中的
But hidden within the 11 dimensions of string theory

317
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:59,685
罗伯特・斯皮策神父
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

318
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,846
并不能完全否认
is not an unconditioned,

319
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,088
完全智能
completely intelligible,

320
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:08,190
无限制连续创造着的存在
unrestricted, continuously creating reality.

321
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,945
然而  一些科学家相信
However some scientists believe that even

322
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,736
即使上帝不存在于体宇宙中
if God doesn't exist in the bulk universe

323
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:22,099
大爆炸的起因可能源于体宇宙
the reason for the Big Bang, might.

324
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,142
有假设表示  大爆炸源于
There's one hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted

325
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:29,904
两层平行膜
when two of these parallel membranes

326
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:33,717
在高维度超空间内相互碰撞
crashed together in a higher-dimensional hyperspace.

327
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:36,669
我个人并不同意这一假设
I personally don't subscribe to that hypothesis,

328
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,381
但这是个有趣的想法
but it is an interesting idea.

329
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:43,904
科学如何能证明或推翻
But how can science proof or disproof what happens

330
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,955
在假设的维度中会发生什么
in these proposed extra dimensions

331
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:50,008
它又如何能支持或反对造物者的存在
and whether they support or undermine the existence of a creator

332
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,351
我们毕竟被困在三维空间之中
when we're destined to remain in our 3 dimensional world?

333
00:19:56,943 --> 00:20:01,946
一种途径便是  我们可以通过粒子碰撞
One possibility is that we can find the effects of those other dimensions

334
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,327
试图让它们进入其他维度
by interacting with particles that may be able

335
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,269
以发现其他维度所产生的影响
to move into those other dimensions.

336
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:11,632
为了找到能够进入更高维度的物质
To find matter that moves into higher dimensions

337
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,574
科学家们建造了庞大的加速器
scientists have built enormous accelerators

338
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:19,578
用于超高速对撞亚原子
that smash subatomic particles together at tremendous speeds.

339
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,351
但这些粒子加速器很快就可一撞惊人
But these particle accelerators may soon do something else as astounding,

340
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:29,114
这在几年前是完全无法想象的
something that seemed impossible only a few years ago.

341
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:32,726
它们可能让科学家回溯到
They may allow scientists to go back in time

342
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:36,559
几乎是宇宙诞生的那一瞬
to nearly the moment our universe was created...

343
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,920
也许像一些人推测的那样
and perhaps as some have suggested,

344
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:42,912
撇一眼造物者的身影
catch a glimpse of our creator.

345
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,678
为确定是上帝
To help determine whether God

346
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:54,850
或是物理规律创造了宇宙
or the law of physics alone created the universe,

347
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,372
科学家们花了数十亿美元
scientists are using multibillion-dollar

348
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:02,175
建造粒子加速器  带他们重返
particle accelerators to take them in a journey back in time

349
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,677
宇宙诞生的那一瞬
to nearly the moment of creation.

350
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,280
为达成这一目标
To achieve this remarkable feat

351
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,171
物理学家在巨型椭形轨道中
physicists send subatomic particles screaming

352
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,444
将亚原子向相反方向发射
in opposite directions around enormous oval tracks.

353
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,316
当这些微物质达到接近光速时
When these tiny pieces of matter reach nearly the speed of light

354
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:22,208
科学家们将他们引向对方
scientists steer them into each other.

355
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:28,763
这样粗暴地对撞
But how can these violent explosions,

356
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:31,574
是如何使科学家回到过去
possibly allow scientists to look back

357
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:36,638
解释上帝是否存在的
far into the past to shed light on the question of God?

358
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:41,861
粒子加速器让我们超越理论的限制
What particle accelerators do is take us beyond the realm of theory

保罗・戴维斯
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

360
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:44,993
直击大爆炸之后一瞬
and give us some direct access to the physics that prevailed

361
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:48,215
所发生的事
at the first split second after the Big Bang.

362
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:52,648
这样的基本粒子高能对撞
These high-energy collisions of elementary particles

克利福德・强森
南加州大学

364
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:57,672
可以在瞬间产生足够的能量
that go on in these experiments create enough energy to create, for a moment,

365
00:21:57,672 --> 00:22:00,063
模拟宇宙诞生初期的状况
the conditions of the very early universe,

366
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,035
我们可以利用物理原理
and then we can actually study that moment of creation,

367
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,106
来研究这一时期
using the laws of physics.

368
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,880
粒子对撞产生的能量
The enormous energy that comes out of these particle collisions

369
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,242
是大爆炸之后
is a microscopic version of the super-heated conditions

370
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:16,494
高温状态的一个缩影
that existed just after the Big Bang.

371
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:22,897
粒子加速器的一个恰当的类比
A useful analogy for what goes in a particle accelerator

372
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:25,199
就是让遥控赛车
is to actually use remote-controlled cars

373
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,821
在真实赛道上奔驰
going around an actual racetrack.

374
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:36,467
我现在和专家丹纳斯在赛道边上
I'm actually here at the racetrack with an expert Dana

375
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,358
他正教我如何使用遥控器
who's been showing me how to use these remote controls

376
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,240
控制车围绕赛道跑
to drive these cars around the track.

377
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:45,233
Dana  这些车速度多少
Dana, how fast are these cars going?

378
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:47,144
大约每小时40公里
They're going around 25 miles per hour.

379
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:50,416
如果是实体车  可以达到每小时200公里
And if it was a real-sized car, it would be going to 125 mph.

380
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:53,048
这是是很恰当的演示
That's actually great for a demonstration,

381
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:55,179
因为这些小物体
because having these small objects,

382
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,721
这些围绕轨道高速行驶的小车
the cars, going around the track at high speed

383
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:01,273
与粒子加速器里的情况相同
is exactly what goes on in the particle accelerator,

384
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,926
加速器中微小的基本粒子被驱动着
where you have the tiny fundamental particles begin driven around the track

385
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:07,717
以近光速的高速围绕轨道运行
at incredibly high speeds, almost the speed of light.

386
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:11,710
利用圆形轨道用强力磁场做引导
The guided rounded track, using powerful magnets.

387
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,602
我们用这些小车来代表
We actually want the cars to represent these super-fast particles

388
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,964
粒子加速器中的超高速粒子
that are going around in the particle accelerator.

389
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,475
现在我们已经让赛车达到预期速度了
So now that we've got the cars up to speed,

390
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,326
我想做一件有趣的事
I'm thinking a fun thing to do would be to

391
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:24,878
即引导它们相撞
actually guide them into each other and collide them.

392
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,039
可以这样做吗
Could we do that?

393
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,691
可以  但会是一次严重车祸
We could, but we're gonna get a big crash.

394
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:31,493
-会发生什么呢  -残骸乱飞
- What would happen? - Oh, parts are gonna go everywhere.

395
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:32,973
开始吧
Well, let's do it.

396
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:43,000
好极了
Oh, that's great!

397
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,356
残骸到处散落  我们去看看
Pieces everywhere, let's go and have a look.

398
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,197
好极了
This is great.

399
00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:57,000
大片都在这里
Wow, we have all of these great pieces.

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,551
这里有很多碎片
A lot of pieces here.

401
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,463
这次碰撞产生的能量
The energy created in this collision

402
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:06,166
立刻将小车瓦解成许多碎片
immediately shatters the cars into dozens of pieces.

403
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:09,638
当这种爆炸在粒子加速器中
When this explosion is amplified exponentially,

404
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:11,509
以指数倍数放大
in a particle accelerator,

405
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,471
产生了如此巨大的能量
it creates so much energy that,

406
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:14,931
以至于有一刹那
for a split second,

407
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,432
碰撞点周围的情况
the conditions around the crash site

408
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:20,455
近似于宇宙最初形成时的状况
begin to resemble those near the moment our universe was created,

409
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:26,088
科学家或能看到上帝之手在创造这一切
and scientists may be able to see the hand of God starting it all.

410
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,841
宇宙早期的模样
You actually get a glimpse of

411
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:32,023
由此可略见一斑
what the universe was like very early on.

412
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:34,564
我们能看到宇宙的初生
So we get a glimpse of creation.

413
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:39,927
通过物理  我们能看到数十亿年前
We can actually see how things got the way they are now

414
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:43,740
宇宙的万物是如何发展至今日的
through physics that was going on billions of years ago.

415
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:47,933
正如通过用实验制造一些碎片
So it's as though as going back to the factory of creation

416
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:51,385
还原工厂生产的情形
by creating a little piece of it in the experiment

417
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:53,887
这使得我们能见到创世的瞬间
and allowing us to look at the creation moment

418
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:57,419
看看物理学定律能否展示当时的真实情况
and see that the laws of physics can tell us what really happened--

419
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,111
同样
In the same way here,

420
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:01,652
我们可以通过撞车的结果
if we look at the output of the collision,

421
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:04,523
用物理学原理推导出
and we can use the laws of physics to figure out

422
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,155
小车是怎样相撞的
how the cars collided

423
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,156
以及小车是由什么组成的
and what the cars were made of.

424
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,512
粒子加速器尚未能解答有神与否
Particle accelerators have not yet answered the God question,

425
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:21,145
因为最新技术还无法产生足够能量
because the latest technology can't generate enough energy

426
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:25,047
无法回溯到创世瞬间
to go all the way back to the exact moment of creation.

427
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,920
迄今为止  科学家们已能再现
So far, scientists have reached

428
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,871
创世大爆炸后的一瞬间
to a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

429
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:35,514
尚未发现任何物理学无法解释之事
Without finding anything that can't be explained by physics.

430
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:40,217
当然  人们想回最初那一刻
Of course, people want to go back to the very first moment itself.

431
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:43,560
在他们想象中  得以见证
That's where they might imagine that one would see, so to speak,

432
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,961
上帝之手或是创始者之标
the hand of God or the maker's mark.

433
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:47,772
这仍未实现
We haven't got there yet.

434
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:51,414
根据我们所有的实验和观察
With all the experiments and observations that we've made,

435
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:54,727
尚未发现任何违背物理规律的情况
we've never found any single exception to physical law,

436
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:57,978
伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
《大设计》合著者

437
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,888
我们可以认为
so we believe that there's a good case to be made

438
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,329
奇迹没有发生
that miracles don't happen,

439
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,521
一切皆可用自然法则来解释
and everything can be explained by the laws of nature.

440
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,903
目前为止
Just because up to this point,

441
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:09,866
尚未发现物理学原理无法解释的事情
one has not discovered anything that couldn't be explained by a physical law

442
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:12,268
罗伯特・斯皮策神父
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

443
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,048
但这并不意味着 在将来
doesn't mean that in the future

444
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:15,230
不会有大量
there couldn't be literally thousands of things

445
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:20,194
用物理学无法解释的最新发现
newly discovered that aren't explained by any physical law.

446
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:21,794
为什么呢
Why is that?

447
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:27,128
因为科学本身必须接受新的发现
Because science itself must always be open to new discoveries.

448
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,001
然而  如果科学家最终能够
However, if scientist are eventually able

449
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:34,032
用自然规律解释一切
to use the laws of nature to explain everything,

450
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:38,865
是否有一天能用科学角度来理解
will be someday be able to understand, in scientific terms,

451
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:45,500
类似灵魂和意识  天堂和地狱的概念呢
concepts like the soul, consciousness, heaven and hell?

452
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,422
要求科学有一天能找到
It's probably asking too much in science to find

453
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,894
代表天堂或其他来自古老神话
that one day there'll be solutions of equations

454
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:54,346
这些伟大事物的方程解
that represent heaven or hell or some other great thing

455
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:57,457
似乎有些过分了
from mythological legends of old.

456
00:26:57,668 --> 00:27:00,339
这些也许比科学精妙得多
It's probably going to be a lot more subtle than that.

457
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:09,225
对于创世界 科学家们希望
Physicists hope to eventually have a complete scientific explanation

458
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,667
最终做出完整的科学解释
for how the universe was created,

459
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,819
但他们说这也许超出了他们的理解
but they say it may be beyond their grasp

460
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,202
无法确定上帝是否创立了这些科学法则
to determine whether or not God created these scientific laws.

461
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:22,414
除非有个创造者于实行计划时
Unless we had a creator who left a message

462
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:26,356
在宇宙密码中留下了一条信息
inside the universe's cosmic code when he programmed it.

463
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:31,159
宇宙程序建筑师的线索
Are there clues to the architect of that cosmic program,

464
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,951
这些深藏在宇宙中的数据
buried deep within it, with all those ones and zeros,

465
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,533
会像造物主的标记一样
like the maker's mark

466
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:38,564
于宇宙初始时烙印在建筑师的身上吗
stamped on the architect of the universe at the outset?

467
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,416
这个问题充满诱惑力
Well, the problem is tantalizing those ideas,

468
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,638
因为就算永远研究这些数据
one might follow those ones and zeroes

469
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,319
也许还是找不到这个标记
forever and ever and still not find this mark.

470
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,871
我认为那是做无用功  注定要失败
I think that's a lost cause, a hopeless exercise,

471
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:50,302
但是在更深的层次
but in some deeper sense,

472
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:52,514
若宇宙遵循数学原理
the fact that the universe is mathematical--

473
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:56,356
当我们探索数学领域时
and when we explore Mathematical realm,

474
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,898
在某种意义上我们得以一窥上帝的意志
we are, in a certain sense glimpsing the mind of God.

475
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,251
我们真正在做的  是在一个隐性的层次
What we're really doing is exploring, at a hidden level,

476
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,252
探索自然规律
the order in nature.

477
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:10,365
但是最近一位世界上最受尊重的科学家
But one of the most respected scientists in the world

478
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:13,678
近期震惊了世界
recently rocked the planet

479
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:17,310
他声称已探寻出自然界的隐性规律
when he said he's explored the hidden order of nature

480
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,542
并用数学的证据说明
and found mathematical proof

481
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:24,505
上帝不需存在
that God doesn't need to exist.

482
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:32,580
宇宙与上帝的争论愈演愈烈
As the debate over God and the universe rages

483
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,682
著名物理学家霍金于其著作《大设计》写道
fame physicist Stephen Hawking said in his book the Grand Design

484
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:39,704
量子理论最新的推算
that the latest calculations in quantum theory

485
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:43,797
表明宇宙从不需要创世者
suggest a universal creator need never have existed.

486
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:48,270
霍金及其合著人伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow

487
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:51,402
断言物理规则
assert that the laws of physics

488
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:56,216
令整个宇宙自发形成
allow entire universes to form spontaneously.

489
00:28:57,687 --> 00:29:00,418
史蒂芬・霍金和我在《大设计》中说到
Stephen Hawking and I say in The grand design

490
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,130
宇宙  银河系  太阳系
that the universe, the galaxy, the Solar System,

491
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,252
伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
《大设计》合著者

492
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,931
地球  岩石
the Earth, this rock,

493
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,513
以及所有一切事物都可无中生有
that everything could have come from nothing.

494
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:10,655
它们可以在量子论的空间中自发产生
They could have been created spontaneously from a quantum vacuum.

495
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:14,548
所以我们真的不需要上帝来创造世界
And so we don't really need God as a creator of the universe.

496
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:16,459
只需遵循物理定律就可形成
It follows from the laws of physics.

497
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:22,053
宇宙可以自发地源自于无
The universe could have formed spontaneously out of nothing,

498
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:25,944
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

499
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,134
因为根据量子论物理学
because according to quantum physics,

500
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:26,995
粒子可以凭空出现一小段时间
particles can form for a short time out of nothing,

501
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,667
然后再度消失
and then they disappear again.

502
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,819
我们在实验室观察到这种现象并测量过
We see this happening in labs. We've measured it.

503
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:36,471
也许有很多量子波动已经消逝
Well, maybe there are lots of quantum fluctuations which go away,

504
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:42,746
但某些情况便能继续发展和扩张
but in some cases conditions become conducive to further expansion.

505
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:46,888
一个巨大的宇宙便能无中生有
That can then create a giant universe out of essentially nothing.

506
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,292
但是菲利潘科和其他物理学家
But Filippenko and other physicists

507
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:56,035
提出我们不知道物理定律是如何或何时起源
say we don't know how or when the laws of physics originated.

508
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:57,726
这很重要
This is significant,

509
00:29:57,726 --> 00:30:00,487
因为评论家们说自发创世
because critics say spontaneous creation

510
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:04,490
要求在大爆炸前就有自然规则存在
requires nature to exist prior to the Big Bang.

511
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:07,482
霍金所说的虚无
The nothingness Hawking is talking about

512
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:11,575
是一种由物理定律支配的量子真空
is a quantum vacuum ruled by physical laws.

513
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:14,346
就好比说
It's like saying,

514
00:30:14,717 --> 00:30:18,999
我有一个银行账户  但不幸的是
"I have a bank account, but unfortunately

515
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,741
这个账户里没有钱
in my bank account I have a zero Balance."

516
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:25,444
罗伯特・斯皮策神父
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

517
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:23,593
那是否意味着
Does that mean that

518
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:27,475
我并没有在真正的银行中有真正的账户呢
I don't have a real bank account in a real bank?

519
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:28,906
当然不是
Of course not.

520
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:31,528
即便我的余额为零
Just because I have a zero balance,

521
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:35,080
这个账户确实存在于一个真实的银行
the bank account really exists in a real bank.

522
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:38,653
当神学家们谈到
When theologians talk about

523
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:41,504
宇宙起源之前已有的存在
what existed before the beginning of the universe

524
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:44,266
他们想象宇宙曾是虚空
they imagine it was a true void.

525
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:47,839
宇宙曾是虚空
The universe was really nothing,

526
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:52,521
那意味着有某物超越了宇宙
that implies something beyond the universe,

527
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:56,934
创造了宇宙
something transcending the universe created it,

528
00:30:56,945 --> 00:31:01,798
将宇宙从虚无发展至有物质
to move it from nothing to something when it was nothing.

529
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,720
这个超常的实体就是上帝
And that transcendent entity, well, that would be God.

530
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:10,534
史蒂芬・霍金
Stephen Hawking responds

531
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:13,265
以一个令人吃惊的高雅理论予以回击
with an elegant and startling theory

532
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:18,238
可以用一个南加州的地标性建筑来说明
that can be demonstrated inside a southern California landmark.

533
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,341
我在洛杉矶格里菲斯天文台的
I'm walking under the planetarium dome of

534
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:25,003
天文馆圆顶下行走
Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.

535
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:27,304
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

536
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:29,095
这圆顶很好地说明了
The dome gives a good illustration of one idea for the origin of the universe

537
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,767
宇宙起源的无边界假设论
called, "The no boundary proposal."

538
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:36,260
目前最成熟的宇宙起源论告诉我们
Our best theory for the origin of the universe tells us

539
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:39,422
宇宙源自于一个点
that the universe came from a single point.

540
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:43,635
一切物质  空间  时间  能量
All matter, space, time, energy,

541
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,057
甚至物理定律
and even the laws of physics

542
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:50,599
似乎都是从这个点爆发出来的
seem to have exploded into existence from that single point.

543
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:56,574
然而  当科学家们用物理基本定律
However, when scientists use the classical laws of physics

544
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:59,155
解释大爆炸是如何发生的
to figure out how the Big Bang started,

545
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:01,817
他们遭遇了
they encounter what's called

546
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:04,679
奇点
"A singularity"--

547
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:08,411
在那里物理定律似乎无效
a place where the laws of physics seem to break down

548
00:32:08,412 --> 00:32:10,573
理论上必须有一个超常的上帝
and a transcendent God is theoretically

549
00:32:10,573 --> 00:32:12,934
来驱动这一切
needed to start the universe.

550
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:16,577
这对科学家来说真的是个问题
This is a real problem for scientists,

551
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,477
但是史蒂芬・霍金
but Stephen Hawking

552
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,039
和其他无边界假设的支持者们
and other proponents of the "No boundary proposal"

553
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,041
为此找到了一个办法
have found a way around this

554
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,563
他们说宇宙并非始于一个奇点
by saying that the universe didn't begin in a singularity.

555
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:30,765
他们说宇宙的初始并非一个点
They say the beginning of the universe wasn't a point.

556
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:32,787
而是更像个圆顶
It was more like a dome.

557
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:37,681
大爆炸一发生  时空就扭曲到一起
Just after the Big Bang, space and time curved together.

558
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,642
另一点不易理解的是
As hard as it is to imagine,

559
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:44,475
霍金说时间是空间的另一个维度
Hawking says time actually started out as another dimension of space.

560
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,417
根据无边界假设
With the no boundary proposal,

561
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,829
物理定律一直有效
there was never a time when the laws of physics didn't work.

562
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:54,101
空间和时间没有边界  没有边缘
Space and time had no boundary, no edge,

563
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:57,384
没有开始  没有奇点
no beginning, no singularity...

564
00:32:57,814 --> 00:33:01,636
所以试图回到宇宙初始
So trying to travel back in time to the beginning of the universe

565
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:05,239
就像试图去往北极的北边
is like trying to travel north of the north pole

566
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:08,931
或是达到比圆顶更高的地方
or, in this analogy higher than the top of our perfect dome.

567
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:14,534
无法到达  因为根本没有这样的地方
Can't get there, because no such place exists.

568
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:18,237
若沿着宇宙历史
If you trace the great story back to

569
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:20,129
回溯到你以为的最初时刻
what you thought was the first moment,

570
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:23,490
保罗・戴维斯
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

571
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:23,110
一切全都融合成了某种量子模糊
it all merges in some quantum fuzz,

572
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:26,122
所以从未存在一个起点
so there's never a singular switching on.

573
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:30,625
宇宙是自给的  这个观点很恰当
So it's a really neat idea that the universe is, somehow, self-contained.

574
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:34,828
没有以前  时间不能延伸至永恒
There was no before. Time does not extend back for all eternity.

575
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:39,731
空间和时间随宇宙诞生而诞生
Time begins with the universe. Space begins with the universe.

576
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:43,284
所以这样一来  就没有起始的一点
But in such a way that there isn't a single or first moment.

577
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:48,117
若"无边界"理论与"自然发生"论为真
If the "no boundary proposal" and spontaneous creation are true,

578
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:49,317
霍金认为
Hawking says,

579
00:33:49,948 --> 00:33:52,149
宇宙并没有的起点
the universe had no true beginning

580
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,011
所以只需遵循物理规律发展
and would have required nothing outside

581
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,582
便能逐渐发展成形
the laws of physics to come into existence.

582
00:33:57,293 --> 00:34:00,344
那为何我们需要超自然的造物者呢
So why do we need a transcendent creator?

583
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:06,609
不可能有个人坐在那  然后说
There was no point when someone's sitting there and going,

584
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:07,909
让宇宙诞生吧
"Let's start a universe."

585
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,641
根本不存在这样的时间点
You don't have that point of time anymore.

586
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,953
"宇宙是从无到有的" 这一理念也意味着
And the idea that the universe can come spontaneously from nothing

587
00:34:12,953 --> 00:34:15,414
不需要上帝去创造一切
also means you don't need a God to make everything.

588
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,556
所以  结合二者来看
So, taken together, those two ideas show that

589
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,638
证明我们需要上帝的论点
the standard arguments for why we need a God

590
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,178
是站不住脚的
don't really hold.

591
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:26,552
霍金和蒙洛迪诺的评论称
Hawking and Mlodinow's critics say

592
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,613
"宇宙无边界"假说逻辑十分严谨
the "no boundary proposal" is an elegant theory

593
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:32,105
有可能是正确的
that may actually be correct,

594
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:34,097
但却没能直击要害
but it's beside the point.

595
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,749
他们没有明确说明
You're not really saying that

596
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:41,241
宇宙会无限地回缩至时间之中
the universe extends infinitely backward into time.

597
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:43,843
其首要观点
All you are saying is that

598
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:47,955
便是初始阶段一切都处于混沌状态
your initial point is a kind of fuzzy condition.

599
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:50,608
说白了
Which quite frankly means

600
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:52,579
还是存在一个起点的
you still need a beginning.

601
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,031
为了反驳史蒂芬・霍金
To counter Stephen Hawking

602
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,922
并论证上帝存在说
and support the idea of God,

603
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:02,425
许多神学家支持BGV定理
many theologians signed the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin Theorem.

604
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:06,408
它由三位杰出的主流物理学家所提出
Formulated by three prominent mainstream physicists,

605
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,330
阐述了"任何一个膨胀宇宙
it states that any expanding universe

606
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,081
必有其起源"这一观点
must have have had a beginning.

607
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,854
他们认为  这是真理
This is true, they say,

608
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:18,806
即使这个宇宙处于多重宇宙的环境中
even if the universe is part of a multi-verse,

609
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:22,999
只要其它宇宙也在同时膨胀
as long as those universes are also expanding.

610
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,312
其所展示的每个膨胀中的宇宙模型
What they showed was that every inflating universal model

611
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,364
定会需要引入时间的边界
would have to have a boundary to pass time.

612
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,707
即使这一边界将是向
And even if that boundary only indicated a transition

613
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:36,927
向新型物理学的过渡
to a new kind of physics,

614
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:43,121
即使在那个环境下  仍然需要边界
even that condition would require some kind of boundary to past time,

615
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:46,494
所以在宇宙处于虚无状态之前
so eventually you are going to get to a beginning,

616
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:49,036
终归需要一个开始
prior to which the universe was nothing,

617
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:53,748
即某种超自然的力量推动了宇宙形成
implying some sort of transcendent force to create it.

618
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,501
争论的两派
With each side of this debate

619
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:59,232
对于宇宙的初始和上帝的存在
citing their own complicated mathematical evidence

620
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:02,665
各执己见  各有复杂的方程
about a possible beginning and a possible creator,

621
00:36:02,915 --> 00:36:04,936
究竟谁的方程式才是正确的
whose equations are right?

622
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:08,749
史蒂芬・霍金的阐述得很好
Stephen Hawking expresses this very well.

623
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,931
我们对于虚拟世界有各种先进的数学描述
We have all this contending mathematical descriptions of possible worlds.

624
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:17,254
究竟是什么使得其中一组方程式成立
What is it that breathes fire into one particular set of equations

625
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:19,146
从而造就了整个宇宙呢
and makes a universe form all together?

626
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:21,937
这个问题问得好
That's a good question.

627
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:28,661
究竟是什么让这些方程的成为现实
What is it that literally breathed reality into these equations

628
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:30,523
让它们发挥作用
that enabled them to do something,

629
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:34,415
使之持续升温  乃至爆炸  形成宇宙
to burn, to explode, to become a universe?

630
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,727
真是问到点子上了
That's a very good question,

631
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:41,400
这暗示着超自然造物主的存在
and it does imply a transcendent creator.

632
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:46,363
有关是否存在超自然的上帝
This debate about whether a transcendent God

633
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:51,096
或是物理定律使得宇宙成型的争论
or the laws of physics alone breathed fire into the universe

634
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:56,020
只有在我们找到确凿证据后才会停止
will rage until we find definitive evidence one way or the other.

635
00:36:57,261 --> 00:37:01,333
但一些物理学家却提出了第三种惊人可能
But some physicists have come up with an intriguing third possibility.

636
00:37:01,974 --> 00:37:04,085
听起来可能匪夷所思
As mind boggling as it sounds,

637
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:08,137
他们认为宇宙可能是由外星物种所创造
they say the universe may have been created by an alien species,

638
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:13,591
由于它过于先进  以至于人类无法察觉出来
so advanced it's become indistinguishable from nature itself.

639
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,907
物理学家们在寻找有关
As physicists search for answers to fundamental questions

640
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,949
宇宙起源解答
about the beginning of the universe

641
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:27,870
并试图解释上帝是否参与其中时
and the role a God may have played in it.

642
00:37:29,262 --> 00:37:31,833
有人曾提出与先进外星文明接触后
Some wondered how this quest would change

643
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:35,765
我们现在的探索任务将如何改变
if we made contact with an advanced alien civilization.

644
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:42,851
保罗・戴维斯
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

645
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,479
我始终坚信  如果我们在外太空
There is no doubt in my mind that if we discovered the

646
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:43,180
追寻到了其他高等生物的踪迹
existence of other intelligent beings out there in the universe,

647
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:45,942
那将是科学探索史的巅峰
it would be the greatest scientific discovery of all time,

648
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:49,855
但同时也将不可避免地影响各大宗教体系
but it would inevitably have an impact on the world's religions,

649
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:54,177
因为这些宗教只关乎一个物种  人类
because these refer to human beings, one species,

650
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:56,519
只存于一颗星球  地球
and planet earth, one planet.

651
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,922
难免如此  因为宗教建立之初
Inevitably so, because the religions were put together at a time

652
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:02,664
人们只知道地球和人类
when that was all anybody knew.

653
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:06,576
先进文明外星物种是否
But would an advanced alien species

654
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,997
也会向迥异的神明或诸神祈祷呢
pray to an entirely different God or set of gods...

655
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:15,872
更进一步说  其科技是否已发达到
Or, more profoundly, would they have such an incredible grasp of science

656
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:20,405
能够证明所谓的神明是不存在的
that they've proven a divine consciousness does not exist?

657
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,827
我认为我们探测不到
I don't think we're gonna discover any surprising facts

658
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:27,240
罗伯特・斯皮策神父
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

659
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:26,789
发达外星文明的新奇信息
from an intelligent, developed alien culture,

660
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:31,211
它们和我们一样对超自然有着同等追求
because I think they're going to have the same transcendent desires that we do.

661
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:36,596
即使遇见了所谓真正存在的外星人
I'm not sure that meeting extraterrestrials, if they exist,

662
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:39,848
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

663
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,797
也未必能让我们进一步认识上帝
will give us any more insight on God.

664
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:44,200
在新旧世界对话之时  我们就是如此
We've more or less done that already when the old world met the new world,

665
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,513
新世界的居民所信奉的神明
and the denizens of the new world observed certain gods,

666
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:49,914
与旧世界居民所信奉的神明是不同的
and they were different from the denizens of the old world.

667
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,736
每每遇到新文化的撞击
Every time we encounter a new culture,

668
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,687
我们能从中汲取新的元素
we learn new things about that culture

669
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:58,160
感受它如何崇拜上帝  描述上帝
and how it appreciates and describes God.

670
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:02,832
但首要问题应该是
But perhaps a more pressing question

671
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:07,195
外星人是否就是人类所寻找的创世者
is whether aliens might be the God that people have been seeking,

672
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:11,559
即创造宇宙的实体
the entity that created the universe.

673
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,602
可以想象在遥远的将来
We can imagine the very far future

674
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:18,422
科学发展到了这个程度
where science advances to the point

675
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:21,304
人类不仅能够操控周围的物质
where we cannot just manipulate matter locally around us,

676
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:23,686
但我们能创造整个宇宙
but we could make entire universes.

677
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,209
我们可以根据喜好进行设计创造
We could design them and create them to our own liking.

678
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,122
倘若还能将自由选取物理学规律
And if this manipulation extends to choosing the laws of physics themselves,

679
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:36,995
我们甚至可以创造出前所未有的宇宙
well, we could make universes of a sort that maybe may have never existed.

680
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:39,316
我们可以自行设计和创造
We could make and design our universes.

681
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:41,288
这个想法暂且还太过空泛
Now, this is wild and speculative stuff,

682
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:44,480
但根据弦论预测  这并不十分遥远
but it's actually not so very far of what string theory predicts.

683
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:49,343
也许某天  我们真能创造出一个全新的宇宙
Perhaps we will someday be able to create a new universe,

684
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:52,024
就像是一项物理学工程项目
almost as if it was a physics project.

685
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:55,246
科学家们最终也能够
Scientist could eventually focus enough energy

686
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,908
全神贯注于微观世界
on a microscopically small space

687
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,391
在我们的宇宙创造出黑洞
to create a black hole in our universe,

688
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,491
那么在空间的另一边
well on the other side,

689
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:05,974
就有大爆炸创造一个新宇宙
a Big Bang would create another universe.

690
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,167
进一步猜想应该是这样
Well, it's just a small step from this to the speculation

691
00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:14,820
也许我们的宇宙可能是由另一宇宙的
that maybe our universe is the product of a super duper intelligence

692
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,041
超高等生物所创造
that existed in another universe.

693
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:21,914
若这一假想是真的
If this speculation turns out to be true,

694
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:24,366
它便是古印度教义中所传授的那样
it would echo the ancient hindu teaching

695
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,157
世间存在着无穷个宇宙
that there are an infinite number of universes,

696
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:31,570
拥有独立的神明  幻化各自的宙宇
each with a different God, dreaming its own cosmic dream.

697
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:36,013
但这个所谓的超自然神明
But would this God be the transcendent being

698
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:39,215
会不会就是众人想象中的创世者
that many people imagine our creator is

699
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,728
或者仅仅是一个先进的物种
or would it simply be an advanced mortal?

700
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,211
母亲诞下孩子
Well, a mother creates a child and

701
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:50,773
并不意味着她就是孩子的上帝
that doesn't mean that mother is the God to that child.

702
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,607
我们在地球上诞生
We are all created out of the Earth.

703
00:40:56,577 --> 00:40:59,669
并不意味着地球就是上帝
That doesn't mean that the Earth is God.

704
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:06,984
就算存在诸神  掌管这多重宇宙
Even if you did have multiple gods thinking of multiple universes,

705
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:12,617
在逻辑上还是应该存在某种超神
you're still going to logically have to have some super God

706
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:14,689
创造诸神
that's thinking all of the other gods

707
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:20,352
并创造诸神所掌管的宇宙
into existence along with all of the universes about which they are thinking.

708
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,976
当然  著名的印度教义还说道
Of course, the famous hindu teaching goes on to say

709
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,618
万物可能相反
that everything may be reversed

710
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:32,090
并非诸神庇佑众生
that people might not be the dreams of the gods,

711
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:35,793
亦可众生庇佑诸神
but that the gods might be the dreams of people.

712
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:42,187
这是人类正在试图探求的重要问题
This is the fundamental question that people are trying to answer.

713
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:46,320
是我们一直在憧憬这神圣秩序
Are we just dreaming about a divine order to the universe?

714
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:50,873
还是它成为我们的精神枷锁
Or is the divine order drawing us to it?

715
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:55,026
如果一项假说最终无法
Ultimately the point is if there's no way to scientifically

716
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:59,138
通过实验观察的检验
test a hypothesis through experiments and observations,

717
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:02,440
这就不能算是科学假说
it's not truly a scientific hypothesis.

718

亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

719
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:06,673
因而  关于起源与创世者的问题
And so, since the question of the ultimate origin and the

720
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:10,395
基本上是无法通过实验检测出来的
ultimate creator is fundamentally an untestable question,

721
00:42:10,396 --> 00:42:13,117
它就不能算是科学
it's really not part of science.

722
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,541
科学无法反证超越宇宙的事物
Science cannot disprove something which is beyond our universe,

723
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,383
其原因在于
and the reason is,

724
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:24,504
它身在宇宙之中
it's taking its data

725
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:27,396
又只能采用宇宙内部的数据
from within the universe itself.

726
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,308
这不等于在说
I mean that's tempt to saying,

727
00:42:29,308 --> 00:42:35,041
卡通人物要用动画片中的例证
"Oh, the cartoon character is going to use data from the cartoon

728
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,363
去推翻漫画家的立场
to disprove the cartoonist".

729
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:39,915
这是不可能的
It just simply can't be done.

730
00:42:41,346 --> 00:42:46,399
随着科学进步  上帝的能力逐步减弱
The role of God has been pushed back by the advance of science.

731
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,330
不过  这并不是科学与上帝之战
Nevertheless, it is not a battle between the two.

克利福德・强森
南加州大学

733
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:53,114
人类将一直处于对未知世界的探索阶段
I don't think there'll ever be a time when we understand everything.

734
00:42:53,494 --> 00:42:56,956
世界上总会存在未解之谜
I think there'll always be the unknown.

735
00:42:56,986 --> 00:42:58,837
我们也会有无能为力之处
There'll always be a frontier.

736
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:02,469
所以现阶段我们总会有
So there will always be questions that are beyond our ability to answer them

737
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,890
未解之事
at a current time,

738
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:05,021
但同时也有希望
but then there's always hope

739
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:07,273
我们能在未来更好的了解这些事物
that we might explain things better.

740
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:11,005
物理学和数学永远都解释不了
Physics and mathematics can never explain

741
00:43:11,095 --> 00:43:12,766
定律与逻辑从何而来
where the laws or where logic came from.

742
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,957
因为这是一切的初始
That's where we start from, and

伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
《大设计》合著者

744
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,309
如果有人要说  上帝创造了万物
if people want to say, "Well, that must come from God,"

745
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,750
我们肯定不会去辩驳他
We certainly don't argue against that.

746
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:20,131
从某些方面来说  物理定律就像
In some ways, the laws of physics

747
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,672
神学家心中的上帝一般永恒不灭
are as eternal as God is to a theologian.

748
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,905
但我们可以想象  存在于世间
But we could imagine that there's something underpinning

749
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:29,547
维持并解释自然规律的因素
the laws of nature, upholding them, explaining them.

750
00:43:30,028 --> 00:43:31,448
为什么它们是数学层面的
Why are they mathematical?

751
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:33,490
为什么它们自身性质会是这样
Why do they have the properties that they do?

752
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,101
为什么它们又是浅显易懂
Why are they intelligible?

753
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,122
上帝不一定就是问题的答案
I'm not sure God is the right answer to this,

754
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,163
因为上帝是文化的产物
'cause of the cultural baggage that goes with it,

755
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:44,587
我认为  就这样接受了匪夷所思之事
but I do think that accepting the universe and its underlying laws

756
00:43:44,607 --> 00:43:46,908
即宇宙及其内部的定律
are package of marvels that just happens to be,

757
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:48,530
太不求甚解了
is deeply unsatisfying.

758
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,340
我们一定要超越自我
I think we must go beyond,

759
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,302
我们一定能超越自我
and I think we can go beyond.
