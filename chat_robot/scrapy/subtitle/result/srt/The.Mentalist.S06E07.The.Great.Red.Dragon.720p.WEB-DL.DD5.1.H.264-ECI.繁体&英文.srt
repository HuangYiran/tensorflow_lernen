《超感警探》前情提要
Previously on "The Mentalist"...

12
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,350
她說血腥約翰左肩膀有個紋身
She told me Red John has a tattoo on his left shoulder--

13
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,820
三個點
three dots.

14
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,160
這是我的籌碼
That's my leverage.

15
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,240
把五名疑犯同時
Gather all five suspects together

16
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,180
集合到一個地方
at the same place, same time,

17
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,100
然后再檢查是否有紋身
and then start checking for the tattoo.

18
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,170
如何才能做到呢
How do we do that?

19
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,930
-周四晚上八點見面  -好吧
- Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night. - Fine.

20
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,500
周四晚上八點
Thursday night at 8:00.

21
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,770
-我需要你的幫助  -沒問題
- I'll need your help. - Well, then you've got it.

22
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,300
你如果不去  他就會認為你是血腥約翰
If you don't show up, he will assume you're Red John.

23
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,880
我如果去了  你和簡
If I do this, will you and Jane drop

24
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,730
就不會再懷疑我是血腥約翰了嗎
the whole that "I'm Red John" business?

25
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,410
以后絕對不會了
For once and for all.

26
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,990
你真的確定了嗎
You really think you've got him?

27
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,150
-是的  -此案結束的時候我要在場
- I do. - I want to be there when you end this.

28
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,730
就等您這句話呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

29
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,150
血腥約翰
Red John.

30
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,290
今晚我若能去見你
Nothing would give me more pleasure

31
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,260
那是再高興不過了
than to be with you there tonight.

32
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,330
血腥約翰  有個紋身
Red john... has a tattoo.

33
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,120
左臂上有三個點  就在肩膀上
Three dots on his left arm. On the shoulder.

34
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,080
你們都得
And you all...

35
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,900
給我看
are gonna show me...

36
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,560
立刻動手
Now.

37
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,630
開始脫吧  快
Let's go. Come on.

38
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,960
對了  脫掉
That's it. Take it off.

39
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,530
太荒唐了
Nonsense.

40
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,040
很好
Very good.

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,860
不是你想的那樣
It's not what you think.

42
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,580
你弄錯了
You got it wrong.

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,850
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

44
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,090
派翠克  等等  派翠克
Patrick, wait. Patrick!

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,170
看  這邊
Look... here.

46
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,460
看
Look.

47
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,820
站起來
On your feet.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
到他們倆那邊去
Over with those two.

49
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,330
你們別動
You stay there.

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,570
好了  你們三個
Okay, you three...

51
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,580
到墻邊站著  快
Over against that wall-- now.

52
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,780
等等  不要
Wait! No!

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,010
快叫消防部門和急救人員過來
Call the fire department and E.M.Ts.

54
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,970
告訴他們這里有多人傷亡
Let them know that there's multiple casualties,

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,880
警戒線拉起來
and set up a perimeter.

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,520
是的  長官
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,770
-把你的手電筒給我  我進去  -給你
- Give me your flashlight. I-I'm going in. - Here you go.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,950
簡
Jane.

59
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,630
簡
Jane?

60
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,450
史密斯探員
Agent Smith.

61
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,850
史密斯探員  我是特蕾莎·里斯本
Agent Smith, it's Teresa Lisbon.

62
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,050
-你沒事吧  -發生了什么事
- Are you okay? - What happened?

63
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,610
這里剛剛發生了爆炸  急救人員已經在路上了
There was an explosion. The E.M.Ts are on their way.

64
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,760
他們會救治你
They're gonna help you.

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,240
-不許動  -什么
- Don't move! - What?

66
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,220
把手舉起來
Put your hands in the air,

67
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,000
不然我就開槍了  快
or I'll shoot! Do it!

68
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,000
聽著  我不明白你在說什么
Okay, listen, I don't know what you're talking about.

69
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,880
你明顯搞錯了
You're clearly making a big mistake.

70
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,050
史密斯往哪邊走了
Which way did Smith go?

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,140
我的天哪  里斯本
Oh, my god, Lisbon.

72
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,870
頭兒  我們必須得找到史密斯  他是血腥約翰
Boss? We have to find Smith. He's Red John.

73
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,920
我去找人幫忙
I'll get help.

74
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,670
簡
Jane?

75
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,500
你能聽到我講話嗎
Can you hear me?

76
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,570
簡  快醒醒
Jane? Come on.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,530
你還好吧
You okay?

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,740
還好
I'm fine.

79
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,300
醫生說簡的情況穩定
The doctors say Jane's stable.

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,550
沒受什么重傷
There's no major trauma or anything.

81
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,350
他只是醒不過來
He's just not awake.

82
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,580
現場發現了三個人的殘骸
They found the remains of three people.

83
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,660
化驗確認是布萊特·斯特爾斯  雷·哈弗內
Positive I.Ds for Bret Stiles, Ray Haffner,

84
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,960
和托馬斯·麥卡利斯特的
and Thomas McAllister.

85
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,610
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

86
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,990
我以為核攻擊都干不掉布萊特·斯特爾斯呢
I would think Bret Stiles would survive a nuclear attack.

87
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,690
尸體都被燒焦了
The bodies are all burnt to a crisp,

88
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,140
但鑒證科還是提取出了DNA
but the crime techs did spot D.N.A. tests.

89
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,030
驗尸官那邊將結果與醫療記錄進行比對
Coroner's office checked it against medical records.

90
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,500
已確認三位死者正是
Stiles, Haffner, and McAllister

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,810
斯特爾斯  哈弗內和麥卡利斯特
are all positively dead.

92
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,580
那史密斯呢  有人看到他嗎
Uh, what about Smith? Any sightings?

93
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,590
還沒  瑞斯比和范佩爾正在查
Not yet. Rigsby and Van Pelt are on it.

94
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,880
長官
Sir?

95
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,650
就知道在這兒能找到你
Ah, thought I might find you here.

96
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,650
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

97
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,630
沒事  不過我確實得喝杯咖啡
Uh, I'm fine. I could use a cup of coffee, actually.

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,290
你能幫我去買一杯嗎
Would you go and get me one?

99
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,760
我們馬上要開始聯合追捕史密斯了
We're just about to coordinate the manhunt for Smith.

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,410
那你該趕快去抓他
Well, you should just go and get him.

101
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,450
我更想待在這里  長官
Well, I'd like to stay here, sir.

102
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,840
-你是...  -周和其他組員應付得來
- Well, are... - Cho and the team... they can handle it.

103
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,660
你是要拒絕執行我的命令嗎
Are you refusing a direct order?

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,760
不是的
Well, no.

105
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,140
我只是想在這里陪他
No, I just want to stay here with him.

106
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,570
你給我聽清楚了
Wh-why don't you listen a little more closely?

107
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,100
我命令你現在馬上離開
I am ordering you to get out there,

108
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,880
帶領你的組員一起去抓捕史密斯
put your team together, and get Smith.

109
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,920
簡  簡  那個呼叫按鈕在哪呢
Jane? Jane? Where's the damn call button?

110
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,270
我去叫護士
I'll--I'll get the nurse.

111
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,020
簡
Jane.

112
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,650
頭兒
Hey, boss.

113
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,550
我們現在認為  是血腥約翰帶去的炸彈
Our working theory is that Red John brought in the bomb

114
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,120
想要殺死簡和其他嫌犯
to kill Jane and the other suspects.

115
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,990
好吧  但怎么布下的
Okay, but how?

116
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,270
可能是血腥約翰隨身偷偷帶進去的
Chances are, Red John snuck the bomb in on his person.

117
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,000
犯罪現場小組從墻上發現了
Crime techs have pulled fragments of the bomb casings

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,120
炸彈外殼的碎片  碎片非常小
from the walls-- very small fragments.

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,070
這說明火藥密度高  威力很大
This tells us that the explosive was dense, high-powered.

120
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,240
那肯定不是自制的
That doesn't sound homemade.

121
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,530
沒錯  我猜是軍用級別的
No. Military grade's my bet,

122
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,790
這就說明我們能夠追蹤到來源
which means it could be traceable.

123
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,020
這些是最有可能的來源
These are the most likely sources.

124
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,200
查查看最近他們中
Check for any recent thefts

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,490
有誰曾報告丟失過炸藥
of missing explosives from any of them.

126
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,560
好的  馬上去
All right, will do.

127
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,780
-有線索了嗎  -是的
- Got something? - Yeah.

128
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,850
里斯本在史密斯逃走前曾擊中過他
Lisbon wounded Smith before he escaped.

129
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,350
他是帶著槍傷在四處逃竄
He's walking around with a bullet.

130
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,490
醫院看到槍傷必須向警方報備
Well, hospitals have to declare gunshot wounds,

131
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,830
所以他不能去看急診
so he can't go to an E.R.

132
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,350
沒錯  他需要一個不會聲張的醫生
Right, so he needs a doctor who'll keep quiet.

133
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,910
史密斯一直在薩克拉門托工作
Smith's based here in Sacramento,

134
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,420
我查了一下全市他負責過的案件
so I looked into some of his old cases around town.

135
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,610
他所在的緝毒小組
He was part of a task force

136
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,090
去年在薩克拉門托市南部
that arrested Dr. Alek Lavrov

137
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,730
抓捕過阿列克·拉夫羅夫醫生
last year in south Sac.

138
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,360
一個非法開具奧施康定[強力止痛藥]處方的醫生
A Dr. Feelgood writing illegal oxycontin scripts.

139
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,360
{\an8}Dr. Feelgood指的是常給病人開出興奮劑等安慰性藥方的醫生

140
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,380
-然后呢  -案子審判不順利
- So? - So the case went bad,

141
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,300
證物丟失  拉夫羅夫被無罪釋放
evidence was lost, and Lavrov walked.

142
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,830
所以史密斯很清楚在哪能找到一位
So Smith knows exactly where to find a doctor

143
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,810
不會報警的醫生
who won't talk to the cops.

144
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,390
很好  我們馬上去查
Great, let's go check it out.

145
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,650
不是你想的那樣
It's not what you think.

146
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,320
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

147
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,220

我沒事  我們沒有時間了
No, it's okay. We don't have time.

會很疼的
This is going to hurt.

184
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,820
你確定不吃點止疼藥

185
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
不吃
No...

186
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,390
不吃  我要保持警覺
No. I gotta stay sharp.

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,040
是的  他快喊破喉嚨了

193
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,460

He won't be a problem. How you wanna do it?

194
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,230

有幾個探員正要來這里找史密斯

從后面把他帶出去  在那干掉他
Take him out the back. Do it there.

- He made me do this. I'm innocent. - Shut up.

Tiger, tiger. Why didn't you call us?

205
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,200
說來真怪  因為我不相信你們
Funnily enough, I got trust issues.

206
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,250
你要信任你的朋友

208
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,970
我得給他縫好  不然會失血的
I need to sew him up. He'll bleed.

209
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,620

220
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,160
需要我們看住后面嗎

-不用  我們能搞定  -你確定
- No. No, we got it. - You sure?

222
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,250
雖然我們不是加調局的  但是我們也是警察
Hey, we might not be CBI, but we know what we're doing.

223
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,130
失陪一下
Excuse me.

224
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,170

好的  你仔細聽清楚
Okay, listen carefully.

230
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,860
不要相信任何一名執法人員
Do not trust anyone in law enforcement.

231
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,180
誰也不能相信  明白嗎

在附近有個安全屋  干凈衣服  一名醫生
We got a safe house nearby, fresh clothes, a doctor...

240
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,460
出城的路線也準備好了
A trip out of town.

241
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,160
安全屋
A safe house, huh?

242
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,070
我也對某個人說過一次
You know, I said that to someone once.

243
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,170
是嗎  后來呢
Yeah? What happened after that?

244
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,500
我朝他后背開了六槍
I shot him six times in the back.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,840
乖乖就范吧
Come on.

246
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,970
該死
Damn it.

247
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,090
放下武器
Drop your weapon!

248
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,960
站住
Stop!

249

嗯
Yeah.

251
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,790
史密斯趁亂逃走了
Smith got away during the fight.

252
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,090
那個警探也是
So did the detective.

253
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,430
頭兒  他們想殺史密斯和我們  這是為什么
Boss, they were trying to kill Smith and us. Why?

254
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,860
-我不知道  -看看他的肩膀
- I don't know. - Check the shoulder.

255
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
-什么  -讓他看看左肩
- What? - Ask him to check the left shoulder.

256
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,250
讓瑞斯比把他襯衣脫了看他的肩膀
Have Rigsby take his shirt off and look at his shoulder.

257
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,150
里斯本想讓你看他的左肩
Lisbon wants you to check his left shoulder.

258
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,620
怎么回事
What the hell?

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,020
有  他肩上有那個紋身
He's got it. He's got the tattoo.

260
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,190
頭兒  這是怎么了
Boss, what's happening?

261
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,000
好  把他帶回局里
All right, bring him in

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,810
別讓任何人接近他
and don't let anybody else get to him.

263
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,520
帶回去
Bring him in.

264
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,370
查到襲擊你們的警察身份了嗎
What do we know about the cop who attacked you?

265
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,950
這是我們抓到的那個  保羅·魏海根警官
This is the one we caught. Officer Paul Wiehagen.

266
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
當警察六年  模范警察
Six years on the force. Exemplary record,

267
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,390
受過幾次表彰  沒紀律問題
a couple of commendations, no real discipline problems.

268
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,350
那另一個  科德羅警探呢
What about the other one-- Detective Cordero?

269
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,380
打電話問了他隊長
Put a call in to his captain.

270
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,750
說他一小時前請了病假
Said he called in sick an hour ago.

271
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,080
還是沒查到伯特侖的行蹤
And still no sign of Bertram.

272
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,540
那就著重調查我們抓到的這個
Let's focus on the one we do have.

273
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,970
或許簡會弄清真相
Maybe Jane will figure it out.

274
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,830
有人派你殺里德·史密斯嗎
Did someone send you to kill Reede Smith?

275
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,850
無可奉告
I got nothing to say.

276
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,120
你為什么要殺他
Why were you gonna murder him?

277
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,800
那紋身是怎么回事  有什么意義
What about the tattoo? What's it mean?

278
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,310
你不善言辭  我懂
You're not a big talker. I get it.

279
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,480
禍從口出嘛
Loose lips sink ships and all that.

280
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,870
壞消息是  你的表情控制得不夠好
The bad news is, you have a lousy poker face.

281
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,060
所以我們要玩個你演我猜的小游戲
So we're gonna play a little game of show-and-tell.

282
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,130
我告訴你些事
I'm gonna tell you something,

283
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,590
你用表情告訴我
and you're gonna show me with your face

284
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,140
是對是錯
whether I'm right or not.

285
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,670
有意思嗎
That sound fun?

286
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,650
你偷過東西嗎
You ever steal anything?

287
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,300
你背著女友偷腥過嗎
Did you ever cheat on your girlfriend?

288
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,770
打過她嗎
Hit her?

289
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,890
你喜歡施暴嗎
Do you like causing pain?

290
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,930
我從沒打過女人
I never hit a woman in my life.

291
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,240
你是一個由警察和其他政府官員
Do you belong to a secret organization of cops

292
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,090
組成的秘密組織成員嗎
and other government officials?

293
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,150
是的
Yes.

294
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,480
你為維護那個組織的利益犯過罪
You've committed crimes on behalf of that organization before.

295
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,940
對嗎
Right?

296
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,780
史密斯探員也是組織成員
Agent Smith is a member also...

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,170
對嗎
Right?

298
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,890
組織派你去那個診所殺他
The organization sent you to the doctor's office to kill him,

299
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,910
對嗎
right?

300
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,770
加調局局長蓋爾·伯特侖也是組織成員
CBI director Gail Bertram is also a member.

301
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,950
你不知道
You don't know.

302
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,980
等級太低了對吧
Too low on the totem pole, huh?

303
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,200
里德·史密斯探員是血腥約翰
Agent Reede Smith is Red John.

304
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,590
不知道
Don't know.

305
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,050
蓋爾·伯特侖是血腥約翰
Gail Bertram's Red John.

306
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,300
不知道
Don't know.

307
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,700
你肩上的紋身是組織成員的標志
That tattoo on your shoulder is the membership sign.

308
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,570
我不知道你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,720
又對了
Right again.

310
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,420
還有個暗號
There's a password, too--

311
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,040
是你們成員間用來識別身份
Something you say as a greeting or a...

312
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
和求救的
distress signal.

313
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,630
"老虎  老虎"
"Tiger, tiger."

314
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,710
從我腦子里滾出去
Get out of my head.

315
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,580
一個腐敗警察的秘密組織
A secret society of dirty cops.

316
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,270
血腥約翰是成員之一
And Red John's a member.

317
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,460
帕特里奇
Partridge.

318
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,050
他死之前對我說了"老虎  老虎"
He said "tiger, tiger" to me right before he died.

319
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,440
對  沒錯
Hmm. Yes. Yes.

320
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,990
他在求救
He was asking for help

321
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,110
寄希望于你也是成員之一
in the hopes that you were a member.

322
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,510
但是如果他也有紋身
But if he had a tattoo,

323
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,260
驗尸報告里應該有
it would have been in the autopsy report.

324
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,750
不能相信什么報告
Well, you can't trust a file.

325
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,750
要親眼看到才行
We have to see it.

326
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,760
我會讓周去檢查尸體
I'll have Cho track down the body.

327
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,670
但是很有可能帕特里奇已經下葬了
But Partridge could be buried by now.

328
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,040
那就讓周帶上鏟子
Well, have Cho bring a shovel.

329
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,670
我們的人在找史密斯  伯特侖在外逃中
The team's looking for Smith, Bertram's on the run.

330
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,050
到底誰是血腥約翰
So who's Red John?

331
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,610
是伯特侖還是史密斯
Is it Bertram or Smith?

332
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,380
我要看著他們的眼睛才能確定
I need to look them both in the eye.

333
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,210
驗尸官兩天前把尸體送過來的
Yeah, the coroner released his body, like, two days ago.

334
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,450
-謀殺案被害人是吧  -是的
- Murder victim, huh? - Yeah.

335
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
我猜就是  所以才會一直留著他
I figured. That's why we held him for so long.

336
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,040
幸好你今天來了
Good thing you got here today.

337
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,430
明天就什么都看不到了
Tomorrow there won't be much left of him to look at.

338
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,120
在這兒
Here we go.

339
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,380
布雷特·帕特里奇
Brett Partridge.

340
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,550
幫把手
Give me a hand, huh?

341
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,610
你的了
He's all yours.

342
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,370
把刀給我
Give me your knife.

343
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,300
燒之前都會給他們穿上好衣服
They dress 'em before we burn 'em.

344
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,560
我也不知道為什么
Don't ask me why.

345
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,670
周發了張照片過來
Cho sent a picture.

346
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,530
說明什么
What does it mean?

347
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,140
你覺得這說明什么
What do you think it means?

348
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,690
史密斯處理好了么
What happened with Smith?

349
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,500
我們差點就在診所那里解決他了
We almost got him at his doctor's office.

350
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,320
加調局的人來了
That CBI team showed up.

351
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,130
史密斯跑了
Smith's in the wind.

352
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,850
他可真會跑
That's a good place to be.

353
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,110
我有點事要處理
I've got some business in here,

354
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,340
在這兒等我
so wait for me.

355
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,620
謝謝  托馬斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

356
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,090
您很久沒來了
We haven't seen you for a while.

357
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,520
很高興見到你
Yeah. It's nice to see you.

358
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,080
史密斯現在可能在任何地方
Smith could be anywhere by now.

359
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,040
我試著追蹤他手機上全球定位信號
I tried to trace the G.P.S. signal on his cell phone.

360
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,420
已經關閉好幾個小時了
It's been dead for hours.

361
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,770
像他這樣的腐敗聯調局警察一定會有一次性手機
A dirty F.B.I. cop like him has to have a burner.

362
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,870
拉夫羅夫醫生說他還沒縫合史密斯的傷口
Dr. Lavrov says he didn't get the chance to sew Smith up.

363
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,850
他現在還帶著槍傷四處走動
He's still walking around with a bullet wound.

364
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,610
那么不管他在哪兒  情況一定不好
So he's in a bad way wherever he is.

365
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,220
最終一定會被人發現的
He'll get picked up by someone eventually.

366
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,960
是啊  但是發現他的警察
Yeah, but any cop who finds him...

367
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,950
太可怕了  我們誰都不能信
This is scary. We can't trust anyone.

368
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,630
是啊
Nope.

369
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,600
范佩爾探員
Agent Van Pelt.

370
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,760
你得幫幫我
You gotta help me.

371
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,890
史密斯探員
Agent Smith.

372
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,380
他們會殺了我的
They're gonna kill me.

373
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,980
我要自首
I wanna surrender.

374
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
你在哪兒
Where are you?

375
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,210
{\an8}第十八大道

376
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,050
在市中心  給周打電話  他應該在附近
Downtown. Call Cho. He should be close.

377
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,620
知道了  我們這就來
Okay, we're on our way.

378
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,590
史密斯聯系加調局了
Smith reached out to CBI.

379
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,970
他用了組織給他的一次性手機
He used the burner the association gave him.

380
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,830
我們監聽了那部手機
We were listening.

381
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,030
他要自首
He's turning himself in.

382
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,410
沒錯  叛徒
Yeah. Rat.

383
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,410
加調局的人去接他了
That CBI team is on its way to get him now.

384
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,090
這可不行  他在哪兒
Well, we can't have that. Where is he?

385
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,850
離這兒不遠的小巷子里  我們運氣很不錯
He's in an alley not too far from here. Our good luck.

386
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,920
他認識你嗎
Does he know who you are?

387
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,850
不認識  在診所那兒他沒看見我
Nah, he didn't see me at the doctor's office.

388
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,340
好  你現在就是加調局探員了
All right. You are now a CBI agent.

389
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,480
要一起去嗎  說不定挺好玩兒的
You want to come along? Could be fun.

390
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,670
不去了  我還有別的事要處理
No. I have some other business to take care of.

391
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,120
-到時再碰頭吧  -行
- We'll meet up later. - You got it.

392
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
這次別失手了  行嗎
Can you get it right this time?

393
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,310
是  長官
Yes, sir!

394
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,450
里德·史密斯探員
Agent Reede Smith?

395
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
在嗎  范佩爾探員派我來的
You out there? Agent Van Pelt sent me.

396
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,100
你是誰
Who are you?

397
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,770
奧斯卡·科德羅探員  加調局的
Agent Oscar Cordero, CBI.

398
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,260
我來接你回去
I'm here to take you in.

399
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,720
你得保證我安全
You gotta keep me safe.

400
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,770
他們無處不在
They're everywhere.

401
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
沒錯
Yeah.

402
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,240
我們無處不在
We are.

403
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,310
天吶
God...

404
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,860
到車尾去
Back of the car now.

405
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,990
你不會真以為你能逃脫得了吧
You didn't really think you could get away from us, did you?

406
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,360
你懂事的  幫個忙  自己爬后備箱里去吧
You're a big boy. Do me a favor and get in the trunk yourself.

407
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,510
再讓我歇會兒  行嗎
Just give me a second, will you?

408
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,670
到后備箱里去歇吧
You'll have a second in the trunk.

409
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,250
別逼我動手
Now don't make me do painful things to you.

410
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,670
上車
Get in the car!

411
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,150
我有個條件  我要求完全豁免權
I'm gonna need a deal. Full immunity.

412
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,900
除非你們放過我  否則我一個字都不會說的
I'm not saying a word unless I can walk.

413
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,080
那你走吧
So walk.

414
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,940
什么
What?

415
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,840
站起來走吧
Get up off your ass and walk.

416
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,030
不過但愿你能在你的朋友追上你之前
But, hey, good luck getting out of the building

417
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,820
走出這棟大樓
before your friends catch up with you.

418
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,920
只要你坦白我們所要的信息
If you tell us everything we need to know,

419
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,220
我保證把你安排在遠離加州的
I promise we will put you in a federal prison

420
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,390
聯邦監獄
far away from California.

421
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,470
保證你安全
Someplace that you'll be safe.

422
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,570
五年前  我傷了背
Five years ago, I hurt my back.

423
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,730
為了幫我表兄搬張該死的沙發
I was helping my cousin move a stupid couch.

424
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,740
醫生給我開了點兒止痛片
Doctor gave me some pain pills.

425
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,330
結果我欲罷不能
Turns out I liked them.

426
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,440
我上癮了  自己都沒覺察到
I got hooked before I even knew what was happening.

427
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,320
然后呢
So?

428
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,050
然后
So...

429
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,650
我在卡森泉把一個小混混
I'm chasing a gangbanger down an alley

430
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,120
逼到了一條巷子里  然后我的癮上來了
in Carson Springs, and I'm out of it.

431
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,320
完全意識不清了
I mean, way out of it.

432
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,540
我以為有人跟蹤我
I thought--I thought I was being followed.

433
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,090
我開槍打死了一個小女孩
I shot a little girl.

434
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,080
她十二歲
A 12-year-old girl.

435
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,860
當地警察采了我的血樣
Local cops took my blood.

436
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,800
他們有目擊證人  我當時死定了
They had witnesses. They had me cold.

437
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,140
然后來了個警探
And then this detective,

438
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,580
他找到我說
he reaches out to me and he says

439
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,440
他們可以把這事擺平
they can make it all go away.

440
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,390
然后真的擺平了
And they did.

441
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,290
血樣  目擊證人  都擺平了
The blood tests, the witnesses--all of it?

442
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,960
他們擺平那事兒以后
Hell, when they got done fixing it,

443
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,520
聯調局還給我頒發了一枚獎章呢
the F.B.I. gave me a medal.

444
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,240
"他們"到底是誰
And exactly who are "they"?

445
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,890
我們自稱為"布萊克組織"
We call ourselves the Blake Association.

446
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,980
為什么
Why?

447
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,930
"老虎  老虎"
"Tiger, tiger."

448
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,660
"老虎  老虎  燃燒著煌煌的火光"
"Tyger, tyger burning bright."

449
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,660
{\an8}此處摘自郭沫若譯本

450
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,210
來自布萊克的詩作
From the poem by Blake.

451
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,250
大概某人很喜歡他的作品吧
Someone's a big fan of his, I guess.

452
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,130
組織里還有些什么人
Well, who else is in the association?

453
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,300
警察  法官  聯調局探員
Cops, judges, F.B.I. agents.

454
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,980
任何一個有秘密需要掩蓋的執法人員
Anyone in law enforcement that needs a secret covered up.

455
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,650
比如你的毒癮
Like your drug habit.

456
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,320
當你有麻煩了  向他們求助
You need a favor, you ask for it.

457
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,250
當他們讓你做點什么  你就得照做
You get asked to do something, you do it.

458
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,590
"老虎  老虎"
"Tiger, tiger."

459
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,870
對
Yep.

460
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,450
組織有頭目嗎
Well, is there somebody who's in charge?

461
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,110
肯定有
Must be.

462
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,140
但我不知道是誰
But I don't know who.

463
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,900
我只知道我所接觸的小團體
I just know my little group. That's it.

464
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,660
不過我猜測
But I'm guessing

465
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,420
整個組織至少有數百人  甚至上千人
there must be hundreds of us, maybe thousands.

466
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,310
難道就沒人發覺這一切嗎
And nobody knows about it?

467
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,480
鮑勃·柯克蘭知道這事  對吧
Bob Kirkland knew about it, didn't he?

468
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,710
快直接招了吧  說出來給你自己一個解脫
Go ahead, just say it. Unburden yourself.

469
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,140
是的
Yeah.

470
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,210
他知道的太多了
He knew too much.

471
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,200
所以我殺了他
So I killed him.

472
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,230
你知道血腥約翰
Do you know that Red John's a member

473
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,170
也是布萊克組織的成員嗎
of the Blake Association?

474
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,770
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

475
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,420
血腥約翰有一個追隨者
Red John had a follower.

476
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,750
麗貝卡·安德森
Rebecca Anderson.

477
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,430
四年前殺了幾個你們的人
Killed some of your guys about four years ago.

478
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,250
是的  山姆·博斯科和他的小隊
Yeah, Sam Bosco and his team.

479
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,050
就是他們
Them.

480
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,110
有人曾要我搞到聯調局證件
Someone asked me to get F.B.I. credentials

481
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,420
以便他們能進入加調局
so that they could access CBI.

482
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,850
血腥約翰或者他的手下
Red John or someone who worked for him

483
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,820
潛入加調局  對麗貝卡下毒
snuck into the CBI and poisoned Rebecca.

484
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,830
你竟然為他們提供了幫助
And you helped them?

485
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,300
那時我才知道
I mean, that's when I knew.

486
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,570
我是在幫助一個連環殺手
I'd--I'd done a favor for a serial killer.

487
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,380
是誰讓你搞那些證件的
Who asked you to get the credentials?

488
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,080
我不知道  我只是接到一通電話
I don't know. It was a phone call.

489
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,290
這就是組織的運作方式
That's the way the association works.

490
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,530
你永遠不知道上線是誰
You never know.

491
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,270
你們
You...

492
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,430
你們能保證我的安全 對吧
You're gonna be able to keep me safe, right?

493
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,620
那要看情況了
That depends.

494
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,460
是你殺害了我的妻子和女兒嗎
Did you murder my wife and daughter?

495
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,470
我沒有殺你的妻子和女兒
I did not murder your wife and daughter.

496
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,950
以我母親的名義起誓
I swear on my mother.

497
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,540
你相信他嗎
Do you believe him?

498
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,070
他承認了謀殺罪行
He confessed to murder.

499
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,590
血腥約翰絕不會這么容易崩潰
Red John would never break like that,

500
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,600
即便是做戲也不會如此
not even as an act.

501
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,060
如果史密斯不是血腥約翰
Well, if Smith isn't Red John...

502
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,520
那就意味著我們還得繼續追查
that means we have work to do.

503
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,410
我們需要幫助
And we need help.

504
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,730
誰是布倫達·夏垂克的繼任者
Who took over from Brenda Shettrick?

505
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,360
公共關系部嗎  干什么
In media relations? Why?

506
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,970
非常感謝大家能在臨時通知后趕來
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

507
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,630
這位是加調局顧問派翠克·簡
We have CBI consultant Patrick Jane here,

508
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,590
他將就血腥約翰一案的進展
who is here to report a development

509
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,150
進行通報
in the Red John case.

510
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,600
謝謝
Thank you.

511
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,530
十年前
Ten years ago,

512
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,600
被稱作血腥約翰的連環殺手
the serial killer known as Red John

513
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,470
殺害了我的妻子和女兒
killed my wife and daughter.

514
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,650
自那以后  我們一直在全力追捕他
Uh, we've been hunting him diligently ever since.

515
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,460
今天我們很高興地宣布
Today we're pleased to announce

516
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,810
我們終于確認了他的身份與面目
that we--we finally have a name, a face.

517
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,150
執法部門負責人
The director of the division of law enforcement,

518
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,830
蓋爾·伯特侖局長  就是血腥約翰
Gail Bertram, is Red John.

519
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,690
他持有武器  極度危險
He's armed and dangerous.

520
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,530
如果有人發現他的行蹤  切勿靠近
If you see him, do not approach him.

521
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,240
請立即致電加利福尼亞州調查局
Call the california Bureau of Investigation at once.

522
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,470
謝謝
Thank you.

523
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,310
請輪流提問
One question at a time.

524
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,040
抱歉請回避  女士
Excuse me, madam.

525
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,930
我們能談談這事嗎
So are we gonna talk about this?

526
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,560
什么事
Talk about what?

527
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,310
關于伯特侖是血腥約翰的事
Bertram is Red John.

528
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,960
看起來就是他
Looks like.

529
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,100
如果讓簡找到他  簡會殺了他的
And if Jane finds him, he's gonna kill him.

530
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,000
是啊
Yeah.

531
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,530
那我們就沒問題嗎  把頂頭上司殺了
And we're good with that? Killing the boss?

532
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,290
-我無所謂  -我也是
- I am. - Yeah.

533
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,410
好吧
Okay.

534
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,980
只要我們保持步調統一
Just as long as we're on the same page.

535
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,610
我就是覺得有點詭異
It's just weird, is all.

536
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,460
伯特侖吸煙嗎
Does Bertram smoke?

537
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,150
不吸吧
No, I don't think so.

538
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,210
有時候人們會收到打火機作為禮物
People get them as gifts sometimes.

545

我得硬破解
I'll have to brute-force it.

會不會是名單  你能破譯嗎
Names, maybe? Can you decode it?

558
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,610
我先試試看
I can try a few things...

559
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,840
但破解謎題是簡的任務
But decoding is Jane's department.

560
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,190
我到時候發給他
I'll send it to him.

561
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,620
來一杯這個  這種威士忌口感很純
Here you go. This one isn't messing around.

562
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,950
用了很多泥煤烘烤麥芽
Lots of peat.

563
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,920
很不錯  能加點冰塊嗎
Yeah, that's pretty good. Can you put some rocks in it?

564
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,280
你確定嗎  這可是上好的蘇格蘭威士忌
Are you sure? This is some fine Scotch.

565
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,470
我確定
Yeah, I'm sure.

566
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,760
那家伙跟你有點像
That guy looks like you.

567
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,870
{\pos(258.6,184.513)}連環殺人犯

568
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,870
{\pos(148.2,184.513)}即時新聞

569
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,930
我需要一輛車
I need a ride.

570
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,370
我們在去酒吧的路上了
We're en route to the bar now.

571
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,070
高速巡警封鎖了高速公路
Highway patrol shut down the freeways,

572
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,460
只要他一跑我們就能抓住
so if he runs, we've got him,

573
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,680
但他要是躲起來怎么辦
but what if he hides?

574
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,710
伯特侖在柑橘高地殺了個酒保
Bertram killed the bartender in Citrus Heights.

575
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,380
他在那邊的姨媽有間房子
He's got an aunt with a house there.

576
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,810
你覺得他在那里嗎
You think that's where he is?

577
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,990
她六個月之前搬到養老院去了
She moved into a retirement home about six months ago,

578
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,500
所以她家現在空著
so her place is empty now.

579
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,680
聽起來是個不錯的藏身之處  地址在哪
Sounds like a good place to hide. What's the address?

580
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,620
露絲瑪麗街1408號
1408 Rosemary Street.

581
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,910
我們就到  讓周和快速反應小組過去
We're on our way. Get Cho and R.R.T. there now,

582
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,360
準備好直升機
and let the choppers know.

583
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,230
-他在這嗎  -在那里面
- Is he here? - Yes, he is. He's in there.

584
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,600
我讓卡爾和幾個人去后面了
I got Karl and a few guys in the back.

585
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,130
-他無處可逃  -我們能信他們嗎
- He's not going anywhere. - Do we trust them?

586
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,600
我看了他們的肩膀  沒有紋身
I asked to see their shoulders, no tattoos.

587
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,430
你來這里干什么  我沒叫薩城警局派特警
What are you doing here? I didn't call Sac P.D S.W.A.T.

588
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,750
有人要我們來的
Well, someone asked for us.

589
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,590
在那邊建一個指揮中心
Let's set up a command center right here!

590
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,560
聽著  各位  這里由我負責
Listen, everybody, I'm in charge!

591
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,830
他們是從北區來的
They came from northern district.

592
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,620
都跨了整個城了  到底是什么情況
That's way across the town. What the hell is going on?

593
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,880
是他干的  他把他們叫來的
He did it. He called them in.

594
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,710
伯特侖把特警叫到自己這來干嘛
Well, why would Bertram call S.W.A.T. to his own location?

595
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,330
他不止召來了一個特警組
He didn't call in one S.W.A.T. team.

596
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,040
他把整個特警隊都召來了
He called all of them in.

597
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,180
一片混亂
This is a madhouse.

598
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,620
屋后有整整一隊別的警察在準備
There's a whole 'nother unit setting up out back.

599
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,060
我們無法控制局面了  頭兒
We've lost control of the scene, boss.

600
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,120
他在他們之中  伯特侖混在他們之中
He's one of them. Bertram is one of them.

601
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,490
他要逃跑  我們得停止行動
He's getting away. We gotta shut it down.

602
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,900
誰都不許走
Nobody leaves!

603
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,820
一個人都不許走
No one leaves!

604
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,080
你安全了
You're clear.

605
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,630
我得吃點東西
I need something to eat.

606
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,910
要吃中餐么  我知道有一家很好吃
How about Chinese? I know a great place.

607
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,190
好  聽起來不錯
Yeah, sounds good.

608
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,330
他們在屋里發現了伯特侖的衣服
They found Bertram's clothes inside the house.

609
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,100
應該是有人在他去之前
Looks like someone planted a S.W.A.T. team outfit

610
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,240
就在房子里放好了特警服
in the house before he got there.

611
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,730
然后把城里所有的特警和
And then called every S.W.A.T. and

612
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,080
快速反應小組叫了過去
R.R.T. in the area.

613
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,970
知道是誰打的電話嗎
Any leads about who made all those calls?

614
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,820
一定是個能進行大面積暗箱操縱的人
Somebody who could pull a lot of strings at once.

615
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,470
布萊克組織
Blake Association.

616
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,550
頭兒
Boss.

617
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,270
請各位注意一下
May I have your attention, please?

618
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,520
放下電話  離開你們的桌子
Put down your phones and step away from your desks.

619
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,850
馬上
Now.

00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,750
我是這里特別探員主管特蕾莎·里斯本
I'm special agent in charge Teresa Lisbon.

621
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,100

聯調局監管部門探員  丹尼斯·阿爾伯特
F.B.I. supervisory agent Dennis Abbott.

623
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,490
再說一遍  站起來
Now I repeat, stand up

624
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,440
離開桌子
and stand away from your desks...

625
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,980
請了
Please.

626
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,380
我們正在追捕
We're in the middle of a manhunt

627
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,360
一名極其危險的逃犯
for a dangerous fugitive.

628
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,130
如果你們想協助
Now if you would like to assist--

629
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,450
你們這個所謂的執法部門的長官
The head of this alleged law enforcement organization

630
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,600
是個殺人犯
is a murderer,

631
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,870
還是重大犯罪組織的一員
and a member of a massive criminal conspiracy.

632
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,200
那個組織里也有聯調局探員
Which included F.B.I. agents.

633
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,920
對  所以局里把我
Yes, and that's why the bureau sent me here

634
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,880
從德州奧斯汀調過來
from the Austin, Texas, office.

635
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,520
收拾你們這個爛攤子
To clean up the mess.

636
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,070
我手里有一份
I am holding in my hand

637
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,020
聯邦法官簽署的令狀
a writ from a federal judge.

638
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,610

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,800
你不能這么做
You can't do that.

643
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,360
我是來收集證據的
I'm here to collect evidence.

644
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,800
不要妨礙我
Don't get in my way.

645

大伙開始吧
Let's go to work, fellas.

646
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,140
這是怎么了
What's going on here?

647
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
你的
That's yours.

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,250
我是聯調局的丹尼斯·阿爾伯特
Dennis Abbott, F.B.I.

649
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,580
你一定是派翠克·簡了
You must be Patrick Jane.

650
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,840
他們關停了我們部門
They've shut us down.

651
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,730
我們到時候會找你問話
We're gonna need to interview you at some point,

652
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,750
不過可以緩一緩  我們會在這兒待一陣子
but it can wait. We're gonna be here for some time.

653
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,460
別出城
Just don't leave town.

654
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,380
我們還有個兇手要抓
We have a killer to catch.

655
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,130
這案子現在歸我們管了
Oh, well, that's our problem now.

656
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,170
你有過機會  但是搞砸了
You had your chance to catch him and you blew it--

657
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,700
如果你當時是真想抓他的話
if you were really trying.

658
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,440
這是我最喜歡的杯子
That was my favorite cup.

659
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,860
好  幸會  再見了
Okay, well, see you in the funny pages.

660
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,770
現在怎么辦
What now?

661
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,030
不知道
I don't know.

662
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,820
范佩爾在伯特侖的閃存里找到了一些加密文件
Van Pelt found some coded files in Bertram's flash drive.

663
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,890
我們要不要從那開始查
Should we get started on those?

664
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,560
不用了  浪費時間而已  結束了
No, it's a waste of time. We're done.

665
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,180
這里沒我們的事兒了
There's nothing more to do here.

666
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,520
回家吧  休息一下
Just go home, get some rest.

667
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,740
你不會放棄  我不信你會放棄
You're not quitting. I don't believe it.

668
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,450
不  我不是放棄
No, I'm not quitting.

669
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,270
是放手
I'm letting go.

670
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,390
目前的情況我們已經無法掌控了
It's out of our hands for now.

671
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,070
保持聯絡  好嗎
But I'll be in touch. Okay?

672
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,180
所有的一切  我很抱歉
I'm sorry. For everything.
