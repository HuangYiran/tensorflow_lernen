行尸走肉前情回顾
Previous on AMC The Wlaking Dead.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,130
我已经漂泊了好几个月了
I've been on the road for a couple of months. 

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,680
你自己?
By yourself?

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,730
是啊
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,550
你叫什么?
You got a name?

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,080
我叫Brian Heriot
Brian Heriot.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,100
必须要找个更安全的地方 你来帮我们找
There has to be someplace better, and you're gonna help us find it.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,720
快过来
Come here.

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,160
该你了 小宝贝
Your move, pumpkin.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,400
我在思考
I'm thinking.

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,230
Mitch 拿着
Mitch, grab that.

12
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,700
上去
Go on. 

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,530
你不能只是思考
You can't think forever.

14
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,830
早晚都要有行动
Sooner or later, you've got to make a move.

15
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,900
你从来都不让我赢
You never let me win anyway.

16
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,800
要是我让你 就不算你真的赢了
Well, that wouldn't be winning.

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
我爸就是这么跟我说的
That's what my daddy used to say.

18
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,900
他以前下棋也总是赢我
He used to beat me at chess, too.

19
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,100
该死 他什么事情都赢我
Heck, he used to beat me at everything.

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,230
你认识他吗?
You know this guy?

21
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,760
你爸是不是很严厉?
Was your dad mean?

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,100
有时候是的
Sometimes.

23
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
那你很调皮吗?
Were you bad?

24
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,060
有时候是的
Sometimes.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,130
这段时期你一直都在漂泊?
So you've been on the road all this time?

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,530
嗯
Yeah.

27
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,730
没事吧 Brian?
You okay, Brian?

28
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
怎么了 宝贝?
What is it, pumpkin?

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,860
我很调皮吗?
Am I bad?

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,430
说什么呢?
What?

31
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,330
嘿
Hey.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
你怎么会那么想?
Why would you think that?

33
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,960
我爸爸总是对我很严厉
My dad was always mean to me.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,830
嘿 你是个好孩子
Hey, you're good.

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,130
真的
You are.

36
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,330
一英里外我们有个营地
We've got a camp about a half a mile from here.

37
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,360
绝对不行 Martinez
Hell, no, Martinez.

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,260
那里已经有很多人了
We got too many mouths as it is.

39
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,130
看在他们带着一个孩子的份儿上
They got a kid for Christ's sake.

40
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,900
嘿 如果你想和我们一起回去 必须答应两个条件
Hey, if you do come back with us, there's two things you got to accept.

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,000
第一 听我指挥
One, I'm in charge.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,530
第二 顾好自己
Two, no deadweight.

43
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,230
每个人都是这样
That goes for everyone.

44
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,000
同心协力 否者就把你踢出去
Contribute or be cast out.

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,400
能接受吗
Can you live with that,

46
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,560
Brian啊?
Brian?

47
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,530
你 我 妈妈 还有Tara阿姨
You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara,

48
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,630
我们都会平安的
we're gonna be okay.

49
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,960
因为我们是好孩子?
'Cause we're good?

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,700
是吗?
All of us?

51
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,230
该你了
Your turn.

52
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,930
Brian 听到了吗?
Brian?

53
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,730
该你走了
It's your turn.

54
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,830
我在思考
I'm thinking.

行尸走肉 第四季 第七集

58
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,100
你今天要出去吗?
You going out there today?

59
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,560
去弄点生活用品
Supply run.

60
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,360
和Martinez还有Dolgen兄弟一起去
Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.

61
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,260
我要在营地里建一个护士站
I'm gonna set up a nurses' station for the camp.

62
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,730
他们需要
They need one.

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,960
- 对不起 Lily 这里...  - 别说了
- I'm sorry, Lily. This place is...  - Stop it.

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,800
我希望我们能住在一个更好的地方
I wanted something better for us.

65
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,330
这个营地很好
This camp is good.

66
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,330
我们会把它建得更好
We'll make it better.

67
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
鱼钓得怎么样?
How's the fishing?

68
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,660
池塘里根本没有鱼
There isn't any. Pond's dead.

69
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,860
一潭死水
As a doornail.

70
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,400
但我们还能抓到兔子 鼬鼠
We still got rabbits, skunks,

71
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,830
和负鼠什么的
some possum out here.

72
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,560
你最好小心点 独眼Bri
You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.

73
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,560
我们没走错方向吧?
You sure we're headed in the right direction?

74
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,900
只要Howard的地图没画错
If Howard's map is right.

75
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,360
他们应该把他拖来 这样更保险
We should have dragged his ass out here to make sure.

76
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,400
他老得已经走不动了
He's an old man. He can barely walk.

77
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,260
所以我太才说把他"拖"来
That's why I said dragged.

78
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,000
希望我们没白忙活一场
Hope this is worth it.

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,530
希望那家伙也是一个活命主义者
Supposedly this guy was a survivalist type.

80
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,460
他的小屋里也许有我们需要的
His cabin might have stuff we can use.

81
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,500
他可能还活着
Hell, maybe he's still alive.

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,230
我才不管呢
I won't keep my fingers crossed.

83
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,800
嘿 独眼 你在干嘛?
Hey, One Eye. What you doing?

84
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,930
骗子

85
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,930
这是什么?
What the hell is this?

86
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,400
有人把另一个人惹毛了
Somebody pissed somebody off.

87
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,060
谁管呢?
Who gives a shit?

88
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,160
这家伙算是高枕无忧了
That guy's got nothing to worry about anymore.

89
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,630
走吧
Let's go.

90
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,900
- 伤口挺深  - 没什么事的
- It's a deep cut.  - No, that's nothing, ma'am.

91
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,830
我不小心割到了 没事的
I just got cute with my knife, that's all. I'll be fine.

92
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,200
那...
So...

93
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,930
我叫Alicia
Alicia.

94
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,630
Alicia 好的
Alicia. Right.

95
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,200
你以前是海军陆战队员吗?
You in the Marines or something?

96
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,730
陆军后备队
Army. In the reserves.

97
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,760
那是M4卡宾枪吧?
An M4, huh?

98
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,030
你不喜欢它?
You don't approve?

99
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,260
别误会我
I mean, don't get me wrong,

100
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,400
近身搏斗M4卡宾枪很管用
an M4 is great for close combat,

101
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,900
但至于野战?
but as a field weapon?

102
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,030
在尘土飞扬的战场上 还是算了吧
With all that dirt and dust, no, thanks.

103
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,230
我也不喜欢大型枪械
I've never really been into big guns anyway.

104
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,330
我更喜欢史密斯威森
I'm more of a Smith & Wesson gal.

105
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,300
更干脆 明白吗?
Less fuss, you know?

106
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,560
你总是这么磨叽吗?
You always this full of shit?

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,060
是的
Yes, I am.

108
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,860
强奸犯

109
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,500
杀人犯

110
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,460
他把自己结果了
Took himself out.

111
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,760
你觉得是他开枪打死了那些士兵吗?
You think he's the one who 86'd those military guys?

112
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,730
- 他的脑袋还在  - 算是吧
- He still has his head.  - Some of it, anyway.

113
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,300
看看里面有什么
Let's see what he's got inside.

114
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,230
听到了吗? 里面有一个
You hear that? There's one in there.

115
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,660
肯定是被困在里面了
Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.

116
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,630
进去吗?
We going in?

117
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,060
你打算等到吓尿完了再进去?
You want us to wait till you finish pissing in your pants?

118
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,660
- 我没...  - 别废话了
- No, I'm...  - Cut the chatter.

119
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,560
嘿 进去吧
Hey. Let's go.

120
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,500
- 声音很近了  - 别出声
- It's close.  - Quiet.

121
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,330
- 出来了  - 闭嘴
- It's out.  - Shut up.

122
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,430
哦! 放开我!
Oh! Get it off of me!

123
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,560
放开我! 放开我!
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

124
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,600
放开我!
Get it off of me!

125
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,430
天啊!
Jeez!

126
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,730
Pete啊!
Pete!

127
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,030
如果你一个人掉到坑里
If it was just you in that pit,

128
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,130
我绝不会把你带回营地
I wouldn't have brought you into the camp.

129
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,900
要是你没和她在一起...
If it weren't for the people you were with...

130
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,330
那个小女孩...
the girl...

131
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,000
你和以前不一样了
You seem different now.

132
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,730
你变了
Changed.

133
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,830
是吗?
Are you?

134
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,900
是的
I am.

135
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
很好
Good.

136
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,700
这家伙有不少好东西
The guy had some good stuff.

137
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,800
罐头食品
Canned food.

138
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,530
哦
Ooh.

139
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,030
有啤酒喝了
We got beer.

140
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,830
这里怎么了?
Man, what happened here?

141
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,760
这间小木屋里到底出过什么事?
I mean, what the hell was going on in this cabin?

142
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,730
他把那些行尸关在这里?
Was he storing those biters?

143
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,930
那是他的妻子和孩子
They were his wife and kid, man.

144
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,930
不 他们是行尸
No, they were biters.

145
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,760
那些断头是怎么回事?
What about those heads?

146
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,530
估计是找事找错人 被人干掉了
Belonged to the guys who did the wrong thing to the wrong man.

147
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,200
还是不要猜测了
Probably best not to think too much about it.

148
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,530
最好听独眼Bri的 Pete
Better listen to one eye Bri, Pete.

149
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,130
我分辨不出来他在眨眼还是抛媚眼
I can never tell if he's winking or blinking.

150
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,560
但你知道怎么领导大家 是吧 Bri?
But you know how to regulate, don't you, Bri?

151
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,630
他总是这样一言不发吗 Martinez?
He was always like this, Martinez?

152
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,130
没错 冷冰冰的
Oh, yeah. Ice in the veins.

153
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,360
你应该看看他白天的表现
You should have seen him back in the day.

154
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,530
那你们呢?
What about you fellas, huh?

155
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,700
你们以前是干什么的?
What did you do before it all changed?

156
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,930
我...
I was...

157
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,160
我以前开车送冰淇淋
I was an ice cream truck driver.

158
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,460
然后自我增值 成为一名坦克手
Till I upgraded my life and I became a tank operator

159
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,600
为美军效力
for the US Army.

160
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,500
嗬哈!
Hoo-ah!

161
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,160
嗬哈
Hoo-ah.

162
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,360
然后世事突变
Then when everything went tits up,

163
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,660
我开着自己的座驾逃生了
I got the hell out and took my ride with me.

164
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,530
世界末日并不糟糕
End of the world don't mean shit

165
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,660
一辆坦克闯天下
when you got a tank.

166
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,030
我也是军人
I was Army, too.

167
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,530
驻扎在本宁堡
Stationed out of Fort Benning.

168
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,100
这些怪物出现后 在那里留守了一阵子
Stayed for a while after it all started.

169
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,560
这就是Pete
That's my Pete.

170
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,500
他过于忠诚 不懂变通
He's too loyal to bounce.

171
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,800
你呢 Brian?
What about you, Brian?

172
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
你以前是做什么工作的?
What did you do when it all went bad?

173
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,530
我就是幸存了
I survived.

174
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,330
什么 你爸是天主教的神父?
Wait, your father was a Catholic priest?

175
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,760
是的
That's right.

176
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,530
所以神父变成父亲?
So the father became a daddy?

177
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,600
这在当时给教会造成了一些争议
It caused some problems with the Church a little bit.

178
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,930
Brian以前听说过这些事的
This is all stuff Brian's heard before.

179
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,760
我们从前总是待在一起
We spent a lot of time out there together.

180
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,730
你做得很不错 这个营地
You've done all right here. I mean this camp.

181
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,500
自这些事情发生后 我还是第一次感到安全
It's the first time I've felt safe since all this started.

182
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,830
我和Brian从前居住的地方也挺好的
The place Brian and I lived before kind of worked.

183
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,330
我想着重新建造一个
I guess I wanted that again.

184
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,160
你们的旧营地 听起来很不错啊
Sounds like your old camp was pretty sweet.

185
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,230
你们那里有筑围墙的吧?
You guys had walls, right?

186
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,030
是啊 是的
Yeah. Yeah, it was...

187
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,100
那是个好地方
it was a good place.

188
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,260
这里也是个好地方 对吧?
This place is good, too, right?

189
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,900
你懂的
You know it.

190
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,860
希望有一天你能把这些轶事都告诉我
I want to hear all about it someday.

191
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,560
Brian什么都不肯说
Brian won't say a word.

192
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,930
我说了 往事不必再提
I say leave the past in the past.

193
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,330
好了 这是长久以后的第一次
Well, for the first time in a long time,

194
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,260
- 我要烂醉如泥了  - Tara
- I'm shitfaced.  - Tara.

195
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,360
抱歉 Megan 你可别学这话啊
Sorry. Megan, don't say that, okay?

196
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,930
- 你想出去走走吗  - 好的
- You want to get out of here?  - Yeah.

197
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,160
谢谢你这顿饭 更感谢那些酒
Thanks for the dinner. Double thanks for the suds.

198
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,630
好的 不客气
Yeah. Boom. There you go.

199
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,730
- 注意安全  - 好
- Be safe.  - Yep.

200
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,430
我想我也该走了
I think, um... I think I'm gonna go.

201
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,860
真的吗? 我这里还有两罐啤酒
You sure? I got a couple of skunky beers left.

202
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,560
哇
Whoa. 

203
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
我没事 谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

204
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,360
Brian 屋顶又漏水了
Brian, the roof's leaking again.

205
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
你应该把那修一修
You should fix that, man.

206
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,800
我会修的
I'll do that.

207
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
再见 小娃娃
Later, muneca.

208
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,800
差点忘了 给你个惊喜
Almost forgot. Got a surprise for you.

209
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,260
哇
Whoa.

210
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,330
啊 没中
Aw, damn it.

211
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,330
递个球给我
Hand me another one.

212
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
你知道他死了 对吧?
You know he's dead, right?

213
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,900
你是指Shumpert?
Shumpert?

214
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,660
离开伍德伯里之后 他就变了
He was never the same after Woodbury.

215
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,330
噢!
Oh!

216
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,600
他变得非常鲁莽
Yeah. He got reckless.

217
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,460
他在那边被行尸咬了
Biter took a piece of him right over there.

218
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,160
可是他并没有挣扎
I swear, he didn't try to get out of the way.

219
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,700
是我亲手把他杀了
I put him down myself.

220
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,330
就在那里
Right over there.

221
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,900
真是遗憾
I'm sorry.

222
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,060
有些事情 你是回不去了
There's some things you just can't come back from.

223
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,030
却对你产生深远的影响 
They become a part of who you are.

224
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,360
你要么接受 要么就与之抗争
Either you live with them or you don't.

225
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,400
你似乎就相当能接受
Well, you seem to be living with them pretty well.

226
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,700
你也是
So are you.

227
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,160
那个家庭 让你重新找回自己
That family, they brought you back.

228
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,960
你很幸运 可我不行...
You're lucky. I couldn't...

229
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,930
我做不来 我不敢去冒险
I couldn't do that again. Couldn't risk it.

230
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,530
知道终将会失去他们 我夜不能眠
Couldn't sleep at night knowing I was gonna lose them.

231
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,560
我不会失去他们的
I'm not gonna lose them.

232
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
是的
Yeah.

233
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,730
怎么 你认为你不能保护这个地方?
What, you don't think you can keep this place safe?

234
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,460
我会尽力
I'll try.

235
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,560
但愿我们能为突发情况做好准备
Hopefully we'll be prepared for whatever comes.

236
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,460
现在有你在这儿
Now you're here,

237
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,000
也许我们俩能够共同管理
maybe we can share the crown a little.

238
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,700
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

239
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,860
我以前真该去上高尔夫球课...
I should have taken some golf lessons before the...

240
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,260
我们走
Come on, let's go.

241
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,700
来
Come on.

242
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,560
我不想这样的!
I don't wanna do it!

243
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,900
我不想这样的! 我不想这样的!
I don't want it! I don't want it!

244
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,230
听到没? 我不想这样的!
You hear me? I don't want it, damn it!

245
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,300
我不想这样的!
I don't want it.

246
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,460
我不想这样的!
I don't want it.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,360
Brian 我们回来了!
Brian, we're home!

248
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,160
Megan 他睡了
Megan, he's sleeping.

249
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,100
Brian 怎么了?
Brian?

250
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,830
你全身发抖
You're shaking.

251
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
怎么了?
What is it?

252
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,630
我做了个恶梦 没什么的
I just had a bad dream, that's all.

253
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,300
是什么恶梦呢?
What was it?

254
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,160
想不起来了
I can't remember.

255
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,930
听着!
Listen up!

256
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,360
我们今天早上在坑里
We found what was left of Martinez

257
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,530
发现Martinez的尸体残渣
in a pit this morning.

258
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,660
他似乎当时正在打高尔夫球
Looks like he was hitting some golf balls,

259
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,730
然后喝醉了
he got drunk,

260
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,530
失足掉进坑里
he fell in.

261
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,960
那现在怎么办?
So now what?

262
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,060
将由我接管营地
I'm taking leadership of the camp.

263
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,530
- 不可以  - 先别吵! 冷静!
- No. No.  - Hold on now. Hold on now!

264
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,500
应该由我们投票选出领导 对吧?
We should vote on who leads, right?

265
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,160
- 没错  - 你不能就这样接管
- Yeah.  - You can't just take over.

266
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,330
- 闭嘴 小贱人  - 什么?
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch.  - What?

267
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,760
- 嘿!  - 嘿 冷静!
- Hey!  - Hey, calm down!

268
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,530
请大家冷静
Calm down, all of you.

269
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,160
此时此刻 我们最需要的就是彼此
We need each other now more than ever.

270
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,730
要想挺过这些困境 我们唯一能做的
The only way we get through this, through any of this,

271
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,600
就是团结一致
is together.

272
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,230
现在只是暂时性的
Now this is temporary.

273
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,860
我们会找到个投票选举的方法
We'll find some kind of way to do a vote

274
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,060
再多等几天
in the next couple of days.

275
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,500
现在 一切活动照常
For now, it's business as usual.

276
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,730
好吗?
Okay? 

277
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,500
你听到他说的了
You heard the man.

278
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,230
快走!
Move!

279
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,260
好吗?
Please?

280
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
带上装备 我们去打猎
Gear up. We're going on a hunt.

281
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,260
限额配给 修围栏 医疗用品
Rationing, fences, medical supplies.

282
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,200
大家有一堆事情等着我帮他们解决
There are 100 questions and people are looking to me for answers.

283
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,760
领导也不是一件易事
Well, it's hard to lead.

284
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,960
是啊 我需要帮忙
Yeah, I could use some help.

285
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
嘿
Hey.

286
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,660
有多少人?
How many?

287
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,660
十个
10.

288
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,300
也许更少
Maybe less.

289
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,430
不过他们有很多物资
They got a lot of supplies, though.

290
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,400
也许我们可以把他们接收进来
Maybe we should take 'em in.

291
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

292
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,030
我们的物资本来就不够供给了
We barely got enough to go around as it is.

293
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,130
Pete 我知道你不想伤害任何人
Look, Pete, I know you don't want to hurt nobody.

294
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,660
我也不想 但是我们需要这些物资
Neither do I, but we need those supplies.

295
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,530
我们直冲过去
Now let's just go over there

296
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,130
拿上我们需要的 然后回家
and take what we need and go home.

297
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,930
不为难他们
No rough stuff.

298
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,460
- 你打算抢他们的?  - 有何不可?
- You want to rob 'em?  - Why not?

299
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,500
我们需要他们的物资
We need their stuff.

300
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,400
他们手上有枪 但如果我们下手得快...
They got guns, but if we roll up on 'em quick...

301
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,460
不
No.

302
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,560
不行 我们自己可以找到物资
No, we can find our own supplies.

303
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,060
走吧
Come on.

304
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,930
- 这真是可笑  - 我们收获不错
- What a joke.  - We did all right.

305
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,130
是啊 就两只破松鼠 还有一些炼奶
Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels, some condensed milk.

306
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,000
你想我怎么样? 我在尽力了
What do you want from me? I'm trying here.

307
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,930
嘿
Hey.

308
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,430
你要去哪?
Where you going?

309
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,800
该死
Son of a bitch.

310
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,330
该死!
Son of a bitch!

311
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,230
不是行尸干的
This wasn't biters.

312
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,900
是人干的
People did this.

313
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,700
肯定是刚刚洗劫了这里
Must have just happened.

314
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,600
我们本来可以抢到那些补给的
We would have had those supplies.

315
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,860
你竟然在担心补给?
You're worried about supplies?

316
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,530
这些人死了 Mitch
These people are dead, Mitch.

317
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,030
你说得对 他们死了!
You're damn right they're dead!

318
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,930
无论谁干的 他们都得死
That was gonna happen either way.

319
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,360
现在某些人抢了本该属于我们的补给
Now some other group's got our stuff.

320
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,760
Mitch 住手 Mitch!
Mitch. Mitch, no!

321
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,100
他本来有救的
He might have lived.

322
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
现在没了
Might have.

323
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,430
给你 需要这个吗?
Here you go. Need this?

324
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,930
Brian 出了什么事?
Brian, what's going on?

325
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,330
- 马上收拾东西  - 出了什么事?
- Pack your things, now.  - What's happening?

326
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,300
- 在这儿等我 宝贝  - 嘿
- Hold on, baby. - Hey.

327
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
收拾衣服 带点食物 快点
Grab your clothes, pack some food. Come on.

328
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,860
妈妈?
Mommy?

329
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,100
- Brian 等等  - 去找Tara
- Brian, stop.  - Get Tara.

330
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,260
我们得离开 这里不安全了
We need to leave. It isn't safe here anymore.

331
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,760
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

332
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,800
我们不能就这么走掉
We can't just run off.

333
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,700
我是营地唯一的护士 Tara还有Alicia
I'm the only nurse in camp. Tara's got Alicia.

334
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,400
Megan怎么办?
What about Megan?

335
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,130
听着 事情会变得非常糟糕
Look, things are about to go very wrong here.

336
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,000
我之前遇到过 所以不能让你和Megan也经历这些
It's happened to me before. I can't put you and Megan through that.

337
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,930
不能再失去你
Can't lose you again.

338
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,660
那Pete怎么办?
What about Pete?

339
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,300
你也说了 他是个好人
You said he was a good man.

340
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,760
- 我看错了  - 但...
- Well, I was wrong.  - But...

341
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,330
你相信我吗?
Do you trust me?

342
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,160
你相信我吗 Lily?
Do you trust me, Lily?

343
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,630
那就收拾东西
Then pack your things.

344
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,800
我们今晚就走 好吗?
We're leaving tonight, okay?

345
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,760
去吧
Come on.

346
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,400
妈妈
Mommy.

347
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,260
妈妈
Mommy.

348
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,500
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

349
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,700
- Alicia  - 也许你该开慢点
- Alicia.  - Maybe you should slow down.

350
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,800
不 我不明白 我不明白是怎么回事
No, I don't understand this. I don't understand this.

351
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,600
嘿 我们在一起就行 好吗?
Hey, we're together, okay?

352
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,500
我们在营地什么都有 有食物 有住处
We have everything back there. We have food, we have shelter.

353
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,100
- Brian  - 天啊
- Brian. - Oh, my God.

354
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,200
待在车里
Just stay in the car.

355
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,730
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

356
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,730
活下去
Surviving.

357
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,500
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

358
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,660
Mitch的事情
About Mitch.

359
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,630
进来
Come in.

360
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,260
我知道事情会变成这样
I knew this was coming.

361
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,460
我一直想方设法不让他惹麻烦...
I've been getting him out of trouble my...

362
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,030
Pete在哪儿?
Where's Pete?

363
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,530
他死了
He's dead.

364
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,630
你也要杀了我 对吧?
You gonna kill me, too, now?

365
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,160
是吗? 就为了营地的那个老家伙?
Huh? For the old guy at the camp?

366
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,100
抽烟吗?
Smoke?

367
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,060
你为什么要杀了我哥哥?
Why did you do my brother?

368
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,560
那个营地的事 你说对了
You were right about that camp.

369
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,030
我们应该抢走他们的补给
We should have taken their supplies.

370
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,930
你杀没杀那老头 我不在乎
I don't care that you killed the old man.

371
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,530
你哥哥那种人总是想做正确的事
Men like your brother, always doing the right thing,

372
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,460
哪怕要以自己人的生命为代价
even at the cost of their own people.

373
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,730
好了 抽根烟吧
Go on. Have a cigarette.

374
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,860
我戒了
I quit.

375
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,900
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

376
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,660
还记得我第一次抽烟的时候
I remember the first smoke I ever had.

377
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,900
我和哥哥藏在车库里
Me and my brother huddled in the garage

378
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,900
抽着我爸的好彩香烟
puffing on one of my dad's Lucky Strikes.

379
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,600
他肯定是闻到了烟味 所以他闯进来
He must have smelled the smoke, because he came barging in

380
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,700
想狠狠揍我们一顿
looking to beat up on us.

381
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,900
但我哥哥挡在了我面前
But my brother got between us.

382
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,430
说是他偷的
Said he stole them.

383
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,830
那是谎话 其实是我偷的
Wasn't true. It was me.

384
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,300
但那是我哥哥
But that was my brother.

385
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,100
是个英雄
Hero.

386
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,100
他被打得两眼青肿 还被打断了一根肋骨
He got two black eyes and a broken rib for that.

387
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,600
我也被打了
And I got beat anyway.

388
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
抽一根吧
Take one.

389
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
现在是我管事
I'm running things now,

390
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,000
所以我会竭尽全力 保护这个营地
and I will do everything it takes to protect this camp.

391
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,100
如果你跟我一伙儿 我保证
Now, if you join me, I promise you

392
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,260
你永远不用担心自己做的事
you will never have to worry about whether you were doing

393
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,200
是对是错
the right thing or the wrong thing.

394
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,800
因为我们
Because we will do

395
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,860
说了算
the only thing.

396
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,200
Pete的事 怎么跟营地的人交代?
What are we gonna tell the camp about Pete?

397
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,330
我们就说在找补给的时候 他为了救我们
We'll tell them he died on a supply run

398
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,400
牺牲了自己
saving our asses.

399
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,830
你觉得他们真的会相信吗?
You think they're really gonna believe that?

400
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,930
人们会相信想相信的东西
People believe what they want to believe.

401
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,500
大家都爱英雄
Everybody loves hero.

402
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,600
营地防守线怎么样了?
How's the perimeter coming?

403
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,130
很好 我们有车辆沿着整个营地外围巡逻
It's good. We got cars ringing almost the entire camp.

404
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,130
我觉得再去清理几次 就能有个非常好的缓冲地带了
I think a few more runs, we should have ourselves a nice little buffer.

405
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,930
- 行尸呢?  - 他们来了 就烧了他们
- And the pits?  - They keep coming, we keep burning them.

406
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,430
我不知道是不是热量的关系
I don't know if it's the heat or what,

407
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,260
但最近他们来得越来越多了
but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately.

408
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,730
- 武器呢?  - 很充足
- And the armory?  - Solid.

409
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,930
我把营地的武器都集中起来
I rounded up all the ammo in camp.

410
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,360
正式存放在弹药库了
We're officially stocked in the bullet department.

411
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,000
但还是要告诉你们的人
Still, tell your crews

412
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,260
出去找补给的时候只能用弓箭
supply runs are arrow only from now on.

413
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,130
子弹是奢侈品
Gunshots are a luxury.

414
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,900
我们迟早会需要的
Sooner or later we're gonna need 'em.

415
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,460
没错 而且不仅仅是用来对付行尸
That's right, and not just for the biters.

416
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,200
我 Mitch和Pete
Mitch and I and Pete,

417
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,230
我们看到了外面人的所作所为
we saw what people can do out there.

418
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,400
如果遇到陌生人 就避开
You come across strangers, you just avoid them.

419
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,700
回来这里 告诉我们是在哪儿见到的 好吗?
Come back here and tell us where you saw them, okay?

420
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,960
出发
Let's go.

421
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,800
也许我们能找到个更好的地方
Maybe we can find a better place.

422
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,030
要知道 如果...
You know, if...

423
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,400
我们愿意为之战斗的话
we're willing to fight for it.

424
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,060
我们不需要再找更好的地方
We don't need to find a better place.

425
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,860
这里就是家
This is home.

426
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,160
