Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,410
- Silas.- Hello,my shadow self.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,000
Every time I close my eyes,I can feel myself drowning,and I need to make it stop.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,920
- After months of heartache and pain... - Bonnie's dead,Elena.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,520
We still held on to hope.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,260
I want to use Silas' death to bring Bonnie back to life.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,530
I can feel you.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,260
- Bonnie?- It worked!

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm back.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,730
But our victories came at a cost.

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,170
My hair is going gray,and my teeth are falling out.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm not sure what that suggests,but it's definitely not health.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,040
You're aging,Katherine.You have a few months.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,620
Every supernatural being that passes over to the other side will pass through you.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,470
That's gonna hurt like a bitch.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,260
And new threats are about to arise.

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,640
The good news about having vampire blood in your system is that's step one to creating a new vampire.

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,180
This is step two.

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,580
Preliminary report subject 62547.

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,920
Subject has transformed from human to vampire in approximately 14 days.

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:30,130
Indicators predict a positive response to first bag of undiluted Augustine blood.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,420
Physical strength is an unforeseen side effect.

23
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,890
Terminating transfusion.

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,760
Activating emergency procedures.

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,300
Hi,mom!

29
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,300
I know we haven't seen each other or talked in a while,so I wanted to make you a video update.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,820
Um,I finally finished my whirlwind summer tour,got a new do,

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
and I'm in college at Whitmore,where grams taught.

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,710
This is my dorm!It's huge,right?Look.It even has a fireplace!I mean,what dorm has a fireplace?

33
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,170
- Oh,here they are!Hey,guys!Say hi to my mom!- Hi!

34
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,950
They're planning me a welcome party.Just... just something hokey.

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,690
I miss you.Um,please come visit when...  When you get a chance.

36
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,090
I'll,um,I'll talk to you soon.Bye.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,230
And by the way,mom,I'm not a witch anymore because I died and then came back from the other side.

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,660
Yeah.I'm the supernatural anchor that connects our two worlds together,so...

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,660
Technically,I'm a ghost that people can still see and touch,so... 

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,130
OK.So I left out a detail... or two.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,470
I'll explain when she visits.

42
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,200
- How big is this party going to be?- Well,let's see.

43
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,450
Silas and Tessa are gone,and you finally aren't.

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,580
Which equals massive cause for celebration!

45
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,540
Which equals a massive party.

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,070
Hopefully since each of us have only made one friend in college so far.

47
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,050
And given that mine went radio silent after he kissed me,

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,170
and your was last seen at a tea party for a vampire-hating secret society.

49
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,690
Augustine,right?

50
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,300
The one who covered up your roommate's death and wants to kick you off campus?

51
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,610
What?I've kept up!The other side is boring.What else am I supposed to do?

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,080
All right.So Augustine wants us gone.Who cares?It doesn't matter.It's not gonna happen.

53
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:05,660
We're moving on with our lives together as functional vampires,former witch anchor thing.

54
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,910
I don't know.

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,510
And we're having a party.

56
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,230
With jell-o shots!

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,420
Oh,shoot!Um,I have to go register for classes.

58
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,870
- What?- Nothing.

59
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,840
Have fun registering.

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,400
Oh,my God!Oh,my God!

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,170
Wait.Registering for classes?

62
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,230
I know.I... she's... I know I have Elena's blessing.

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,820
I still don't need to rub it in her face day one in the triple dorm room.

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,750
We could always sneak back to my place.

65
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,160
You mean,Damon's house?

66
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,060
While we're at it,why don't we just have sex in his bathtub,or maybe Katherine could watch.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
This hair,by the way,kind of hot.

68
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,580
- You ok?- Yep.

69
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,950
- I got to go to class.See you tonight?- Yeah.

70
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,030
Ok.

71
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,750
I'm ready.

72
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,020
I know this is gonna sound lame,but... 

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,220
Any time you start with this is gonna sound lame, guess what... it is.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,790
This is for Bonnie,and you had a really big part in bringing her back,so I think that you should come.

75
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,900
Oh!Wait.Hang on.Wait.

76
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,000
- Hey!Hey,Aaron.- Hi.

77
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,100
- Long time,no see.Here.You're coming.- Who's Aaron?

78
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,710
Party in a dorm.No,thanks.

79
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,790
I know what you're doing.

80
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,270
- You like to push people away,but the thing is... - How do you know that about me?

81
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,170
Because you told me at the costume ball when I compelled it out of you.

82
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,020
Ok.Forget that I said that,forget that I know anything.We're starting over.

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,700
You're coming to my party.There will be free beer,and it will be really good for you.

84
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,770
- See you then.- See you tonight.

85
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,730
Well,that was an embarrassingly close call.

86
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,800
Maybe I should be there so you don't spill all of our secrets and make out with the moody mystery guy.

87
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,030
The only moody mystery guy that I want to make out with is you.

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,670
Oh,and speaking of which,invite Stefan.

89
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,300
Speaking of moody or making out?

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,350
Either way,he'll never show.His memory's back,and he remembers he hates us.

91
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,100
Just try,ok?I bought Bourbon,so he could just get drunk and hate us from afar.

92
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,110
Well,I'll be sure to relay the message.

93
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,180
So apparently we've been invited to a college party.

94
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,140
Yeah.That was my first reaction,too.

95
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,290
Then Elena promised a bottomless well of top-shelf alcohol.

96
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,810
Stefan?

97
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,620
You... ok?

98
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,080
Yeah,I'm fine.

99
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,990
How about my favorite reading chair?

100
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,560
Just tell Elena thanks,but I'm not really up for a party tonight.

101
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,390
How about now?

102
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,640
Matty blue-blue,I want another drink.

103
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,130
No!You're drunk and scaring the customers.

104
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,660
You realize that every single time you say no it just makes you hotter,right?

105
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,960
What are you watching,some Czech reality show?

106
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,560
How'd you know it was Czech?

107
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,740
Eye contact.

108
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,810
We're getting started.

109
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,110
You translate,you drink.

110
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,070
Ok.What the hell am I looking at here?

111
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,610
So over the summer,I went to Prague,met a girl.She followed me back here.

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,720
And then her boyfriend put some spirit thing in my head.

113
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,370
- Oh,dear.This is bad.- Why?

114
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,600
My friends will come looking for this blade.

115
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,520
Protect it at all costs.

116
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,950
Some guy named Kristof,he,um... He activated you.

117
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,330
What do you mean activated me?

118
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,180
He's a traveler.Travelers are a faction of witches.

119
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,460
They're big on spirit possession.You've got one inside of you.

120
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,690
It's kind of like a human parasite that's hitching a ride in your brain.

121
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,240
So how the hell do I get it out of me?

122
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,370
That girl,the one that followed you back from Prague,was she,

123
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,280
um,I don't know,feisty,a little accent,ridiculously beautiful?

124
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,090
Pretty much,yeah.Her name was Nadia.Why?Do you know her?

125
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,160
You could say that.

126
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,890
I,uh handed out all the fliers.

127
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,120
Oh,and,uh,Damon said that he's gonna try and bring Stefan.

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,540
Funny.That seemed to imply that Damon is actually coming.

129
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,170
Maybe a call from a mysteriously hot biology T.A.will help.

130
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,160
Well,look who rose from the dead.

131
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,030
I need your help.

132
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,370
What happened,Jesse?

133
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,780
Just come to my room,please.

134
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,090
Ok.I'm coming,but what's going on?

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,410
It's a long story.My roommate's gonna be home.

136
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,040
Jesse!

137
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,310
Jess,you home?

138
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,750
I'm sorry,man.

139
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,860
Oh,my God.

140
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,810
Who the hell turned you into a vampire?

141
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,560
It was torture.

142
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,360
I was in some cell all day,and then at night,he'd take me out and do experiments on me.

143
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,920
What kind of experiments?

144
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,230
I don't know.He'd starve me and then inject me with some weird blood.

145
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,260
What am I supposed to tell my parents?

146
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,180
They left me all these messages.They're wondering where the hell I am.

147
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,190
We're going to call them and tell them that you lost your phone but you're ok.

148
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,070
Where is Wes now?

149
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,020
I locked him in his lab after I attacked him.

150
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,420
Honestly,though,the escape was kind of a blur.I wasn't exactly in my right mind.

151
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,300
Well,you're new,and you're hungry.

152
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,180
Not for long.I brought our stash.

153
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,540
How are you doing?

154
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,030
Our stash?You're a vampire,too?

155
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,040
You say it like it's a bad thing.

156
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,370
First rule of being a vampire is realizing how awesome you are!

157
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,360
- How's he doing?- He's all right.He's alive.

158
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,960
Elena,wait.I was thinking that Jesse could do it.

159
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,600
You're a vampire now.You may have hurt him,but you can also heal him with your blood.

160
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,940
Holy crap.That's insane.

161
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,080
You want to teach him about compulsion?

162
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,280
Hey,strange Lookie what I stole.

163
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,920
Knock yourself out.

164
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,540
Hey.Come on.Please just have one drink with me.Please.

165
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,650
Stefan,I've had a bad... Year really,and it would be nice to have a friendly face.

166
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,860
One pity drink.

167
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,630
See?The universe at work.

168
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,440
I don't know if you knew this,but our doppelganger stars are fated to be together,

169
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,790
so like it or not,you're gonna end up with somebody who looks like me,

170
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,900
although the universe seems to have all of its eggs in the Elena basket,

171
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,920
but at this point,I don't really blame it.

172
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,780
What is wrong with you?

173
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,220
Other than the joint pain,receding gums,and the fact that I have to pee every 5 minutes,

174
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:09,970
I'm dandy,but,hey,enough about me.Why are you all by your lonesome?

175
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,290
So I could avoid talking to anyone.

176
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,460
Well,if you did want to talk to someone,I'm right here,

177
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,950
and,uh,let's be honest,I'm wasted,so I'm not gonna remember.

178
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,860
Look.I thought that killing Silas would allow me to move on with my life,but I was wrong.

179
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,180
I spent my summer locked in a safe.One minute,I think I'm fine,the next minute I feel like I'm dying all over again.

180
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,030
Classic PTSD.

181
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,110
You survived a pretty traumatic event,and now you're back,

182
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,950
and you've got nothing but free time to just relive that terrible experience in the safe.

183
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,830
Well,allow me to give your life a purpose.

184
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,570
Help me with one little favor.

185
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,480
Should have know this was gonna come around to you needing something from me.

186
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,970
I'm just trying to help.What would I know about posttraumatic stress?

187
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,920
I only had my newborn ripped from my arms by my judgmental father 

188
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,920
and then had to run 500 years after my entire family had been slaughtered 

189
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,110
by a psychopath,but,hey,that didn't have any lingering side effects.

190
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,900
Hey.All right.What do you need?

191
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,810
I thought you never wanted to see me again.

192
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,540
Why'd you call me?

193
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,630
Stefan,I'd like you to meet Nadia Petrova,my daughter.

194
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,100
- So your mom's like me,too?- Yeah.

195
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,710
Long story.She's,um,surviving fine.You'll be great.

196
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,850
Your eyes keep scanning the room.

197
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,090
You afraid I'm gonna go vampire postal on the fourth floor freshmen?

198
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:11,060
No.I'm sorry.I'm just looking for my,um... I'm not sure what he is actually.

199
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,680
Boyfriend?

200
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,200
Friend with benefits?

201
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:23,130
He's my best friend's little brother,he's still in High School,and I... Think I'm madly in love with him.

202
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,700
Have you been keeping an eye on Jesse?

203
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,490
Yep.I've been teaching him the art of sublimating vampire hunger via grain alcohol.

204
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,060
And I sent Damon to question Wes.

205
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,570
You realize that Damon's going to kill Wes,right?

206
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,150
He's not going to kill him.He's getting information.

207
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,250
You realize that you're wrong,right?

208
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,250
Ok.Look.I know that you're not crazy about Damon and I being together... 

209
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,360
No,no,it's fine.I'm fine with you two being together 

210
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,290
as long as you can acknowledge the kind of person you are together with.

211
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,470
What do you want?

212
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,380
What I want is to be drinking copious quantities of booze and making out with my girlfriend,

213
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:19,240
but unfortunately,I can't do that until I get a bunch of answers out of you.

214
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,440
Careful with those.

215
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,610
These?These right here?

216
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,740
Why?I mean,we're on a college campus,right,full of students?

217
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,380
I can't imagine an M.D.has a bunch of infectious diseases just lying around.

218
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,590
M.D.-PH.D.I'm a researcher.

219
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,410
Well,that explains it.I've met a lot of people like you.Science over medicine,right?

220
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,590
Let me guess.You use these in your little vampire lab rats,don't you?

221
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,680
Not in the mood to talk?Fair enough.

222
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:58,630
We're gonna play a little game where I inject you with whatever the hell necrotizing fasciitis is.

223
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
It's a flesh-eating bacteria.

224
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,640
Gross.

225
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,550
So I'm gonna do that,and I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions.

226
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,130
If you answer me correctly,I'm gonna give you some of my delicious... 

227
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,920
Vampire blood,and we'll heal you right on up

228
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,840
If you don't answer me correctly,we're just gonna have to 

229
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,140
see how much flesh these little guys can eat.

230
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,690
Just out of morbid curiosity,which one of you is younger?

231
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,030
- I am.- Right.

232
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,730
Ok.So here's the knife the traveler left behind with me.Now what are we doing in here?

233
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,430
Take a seat,Matt.

234
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,760
This is ridiculous.

235
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,610
Come forth.

236
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,500
- What the hell was that?- She's calling on Matt's passenger.

237
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,250
What am I doing here?

238
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,920
It's okay, sweetheart.

239
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,810
Easy,easy,easy.

240
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,310
Hello,Gregor.I'm Nadia's mother.It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

241
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,350
What do you want?

242
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,900
Here's the thing.

243
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:34,070
Nadia's my only child,so naturally,I'm suspicious of anyone who wants to date her.

244
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,000
Why don't you tell us the real reason why you're in Mystic Falls?

245
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,920
To track and kill Silas.

246
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,570
Oh.So it has absolutely nothing to do with this?

247
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,060
How did you get that?

248
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
I would much rather be getting drunk right now,

249
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,680
so why don't you stop wasting our time and tell us what you're doing here?

250
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,590
Fine.After Silas was dead,I was meant to kill her.

251
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,870
I didn't see that one coming.

252
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:11,130
You were using me to get to her?Why?Why would you kill her?

253
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,200
That's what the travelers want.I don't question my orders.

254
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
See why I don't want you dating my daughter?

255
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,210
Because travelers are ruthless,manipulative hypocrites.

256
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,960
I know because your grandfather was one.

257
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,320
What did you just do?

258
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,380
Give it a rest.Matt will be fine.Gregor on the other hand,not so much.

259
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,170
I just expelled his spirits.There's a reason why he wanted this knife so badly.

260
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,140
It's the only thing that will truly kill a passenger.

261
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,470
Turning a kid into a vampire so you can experiment on him?Harsh.

262
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,980
What is it about this place that turns people into mad scientists?

263
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,280
Human trials are a vital part of modern medicine.

264
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,120
Yeah,but don't people usually volunteer or sign waivers,maybe get some dough for tuition.

265
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,210
Sometimes you do what's necessary for the greater good.

266
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,770
I'm not the greatest guy in the world,but it sounds like some Mengele level crap 

267
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,020
that you're spouting out,so I got to ask... What is your greater good?

268
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,340
Rabies.Sounds fun,doesn't it,and appropriate given the circumstance.

269
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,400
Are you doing ok?

270
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,890
- Am I on the famous other side?- You are.

271
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,850
- What,um... What got you here?- I died.

272
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,290
- No.I mean,what were you?- A witch.

273
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,880
What are you?

274
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,580
The anchor to the other side.Every supernatural being who dies passes through me.

275
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,100
That doesn't seem like it'd be a lot of fun for you.

276
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,910
It's better than being dead.

277
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm so sorry.Such a stupid thing to say.

278
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:55,870
It's ok,honey.Dying wasn't fun,but then you felt my pain,so I guess you know that.

279
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:00,050
I'm sorry,but you know what?

280
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,900
The pain's gone now,and seeing a friendly face over here certainly doesn't hurt.

281
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Sorry!

282
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,700
Pretty much had to wrestle Elena to get her to give me these.

283
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,620
- You ok?- Yeah.I think I am.

284
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,800
Good.I'm gonna need you to come with me.

285
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,200
Where are we going?

286
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,890
To register for classes.

287
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,220
That feels amazing.

288
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,910
That's one of the other fun side effects.

289
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,030
Everything is heightened.

290
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,430
So that feeling never goes away?

291
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,760
Nope.

292
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,060
Well,rabies was a bust.

293
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,300
I guess I'll find something a little more immediate.

294
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,350
I wanted to turn Jesse into a new kind of vampire.

295
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,560
Well,that's awfully ambitious of you.

296
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,170
I am awfully smart.

297
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,260
Ebola.

298
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,330
Why?

299
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,120
Your kind is dangerous to humans.

300
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,860
You're dangerous because we're your food source.I want to change that.

301
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,990
What?

302
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,260
Last time I kissed you,you got all weird,and it was awkward,and... 

303
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,080
If vampires don't need to feed on humans,they're no longer a threat.

304
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,420
I'm not buying the good doctor bit.

305
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,980
Human blood will only satiate Jesse temporarily until he gets a taste of what he really craves.

306
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,090
Well,what exactly does he really crave?

307
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,910
You bit me.

308
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,670
- Hey.You ok?- Yeah.I just got to get out of here.

309
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,870
Jesse!

310
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,310
Ok.So this isn't the lamest party that I've ever been to.

311
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,770
Aaron,hey.You made it.

312
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,340
Barely.I think I fell asleep.I just woke up.

313
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,230
Weird.Well,this will make it better.

314
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,490
Oh.Now I know why Wes told me to stay away from you.

315
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,600
Cheers.

316
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,300
You're trouble.

317
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,380
- So,hey.How do you know Wes anyway?- He's my legal guardian.

318
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:17,820
- Really?- Mm-hmm.

319
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,310
- What about your parents?- Uh,dead.

320
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,510
Mine,too.Birth and adoptive.

321
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,180
Whoa.Dark.No offense,but usually,I'm the biggest freak in the room.

322
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,840
So how'd it happen?

323
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:47,280
Uh,our car went over a bridge.I lived,they didn't.You?

324
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:55,870
I was 6,and we went camping,and I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming.

325
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,180
I went to check it out,and I saw blood everywhere.

326
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,490
They had bite marks all over their neck.

327
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,890
Bite marks?

328
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:14,210
Yeah.They said a bear got into the camp.So I shuffled around distant relatives for a while.

329
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,640
Eventually,Wes took me in.

330
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,320
So Wes is the closest thing to family I have left.

331
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,130
I think both need another jell-o shot.I'll be right back.I'm glad that you came.

332
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,080
Yeah.Me,too.

333
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,940
- Hey.Have you seen Jesse?- No. 

334
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,920
Wait.Where are you going?

335
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,550
To call Damon,to make sure that he doesn't kill Dr.Wes.

336
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,320
There you are.

337
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,640
Get away from me.

338
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,630
Stefan,you're ok.Relax.

339
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,380
I can't do that.Do you understand me?

340
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,720
You have two options,Stefan.

341
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,840
You either deal with this now,or you run,but either way,it's gonna catch up to you.

342
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,260
I can't breathe,Stefan.

343
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:58,000
Tell me the name of the first person that you kill... killed.

344
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,360
Name him.

345
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,380
Gius... Giuseppe Salvatore.

346
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,270
And the next?

347
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,080
Focus on the name.

348
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,830
Thomas Fell.

349
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,240
See?You're in control,on solid ground.

350
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,650
You're not drowning.You're not dying.

351
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,990
Name them.

352
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:32,030
Honoria Fell,Marianna Lockwood,Christopher Gilbert,Margaret Forbes.

353
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,790
See?I told you I knew what I was doing.

354
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,820
Thank you.

355
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,180
You're right.Gregor is dead.Happy now?

356
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,670
You deserve better,Nadia.

357
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,240
Rot in hell.

358
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Jesse feeds on... Vampires?

359
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,540
That's what Doogie said,and apparently once he starts,he can't stop.

360
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,550
Hey.Um,the fact that he told you this means that he's still alive,right?

361
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,990
As of now.

362
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,800
Good.Please don't kill him,Damon.

363
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,270
Damon,tell me that you won't kill him.

364
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,380
Ok,ok,ok.I won't kill him.Bye.

365
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:44,920
Problem is I know people like you a lot better than you realize.

366
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,930
If I let you live,you're just gonna do it again.

367
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,440
You're gonna turn another vampire,you're gonna do another experiment.

368
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,240
The only way to really handle you is just to snuff you out.

369
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,570
You're lucky I don't feel like burying a body.

370
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,470
- What the hell did you do to me?- Easy there,killer.

371
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,440
Wasn't bad enough that you locked me up and poked me full of needles?

372
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,360
Now I want to feed on the girl I like?

373
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,330
You feed on monsters,Jesse.

374
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,640
In case Professor Forbes forgot to tell you in your training,sweetie,

375
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,060
I'm a lot older than you,and that means I'm a lot stronger than you.

376
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,820
Actually that's not 100% accurate.

377
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,070
What the hell did they do to you?

378
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,450
Damon!

379
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,350
Jesse,Jesse,let go.Jesse!

380
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,200
He's gonna tear my head off.Elena,please.

381
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:07,170
No!No!No,Jesse!Jesse,come here.

382
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:17,930
Hold on.Hold on.Just stay with me,please.Jesse,just stay with me,please.No.

383
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,590
- What did you do?- He was gonna kill Damon.

384
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,000
But we promised that we would help him.

385
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,170
She didn't have a choice,all right?

386
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,630
Once he had the taste of vampire blood,there was nothing stopping him.

387
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,050
Go ask Dr.Frankenstein.I'll go deal with him.

388
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,970
- Caroline,I'm so sorry.I... - Yeah.Me,too.

389
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,200
Because the Elena that I used to know would have given Jesse a chance.

390
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,280
Dear Nadia,sorry I had to kill your boyfriend,but it was the motherly thing to do.

391
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,340
Suicide,however,not very motherly of me.

392
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:49,400
I ran from my enemies for 500 years,and then one day,I stopped.

393
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,910
Now a new enemy wants me dead.

394
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:04,640
Sure I could run from the travelers,but there's still one enemy that I can never escape,time.

395
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:18,830
So call it pride or vanity,but after the life that I've led,I refuse to drift off into the sunset.

396
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,520
Good-bye,Nadia.

397
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,240
What are you doing?

398
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:55,920
I told you you either face your problems,or you run.I chose option 3.

399
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,870
And what problem has you jumping off of a clock tower?

400
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,080
I'm dying,Stefan.I'm dying of old age.

401
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,370
I don't know the cure did something to speed up the entire mortifying process.

402
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:35,610
Yeah.You're Katherine Pierce.Suck it up.

403
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,890
I'll admit it..I miss magic.

404
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,150
Step away from the candles.

405
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,160
Oh,my God.

406
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,460
I think Jesse's dead.

407
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,390
What?

408
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,590
I'm not ready.I don't want this.

409
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,170
Bonnie,what's going on?Bonnie!

410
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,380
What is it?

411
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,670
I'm the anchor to the other side,Jer.

412
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,610
Every supernatural being that dies has to pass through me.

413
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:40,200
How often does that happen?Why... why didn't you tell me?

414
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:50,070
I'm back here,touching you.We knew there would be consequences.

415
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,350
Just kiss me.Kiss me.

416
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:19,180
You... and me... This,this is worth it.Any consequence is worth this.

417
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,920
I'm sorry.I didn't mean what I said earlier.It was out of line.

418
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,100
It just sucks,you know,cause Jesse was one of the good ones.

419
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:10,360
I know,and I wouldn't have killed him if I could have done something.

420
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:21,110
He was dangerous.I need you to believe that.I need you to believe me when I tell you that Caroline.

421
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,560
I believe you,ok?

422
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,280
I believe you want to celebrate the fact that we can go to school and function like regular freshmen.

423
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:33,020
I get that.I want that,too,but,Elena,when are you gonna figure out that 

424
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,800
the outside world is not nearly as dangerous as the person you're inviting into your own bedroom?

425
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,590
Why don't you tell me how you really feel?

426
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,250
The day that I stop telling you is the day that we're no longer best friends,and... 

427
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,850
I hope that day never comes.

428
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,700
If you're gonna do this,I'd much rather prefer a bullet through the brain.

429
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,120
Actually I'm gonna wait until I can compel all this out of your head.

430
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,800
What the hell's that?

431
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,050
Why does this say 12144?

432
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,000
What do you care?

433
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,740
Because I was 21051.

434
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,870
21051.Hang on.You were an Augustine vampire?

435
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,920
Augustine.I haven't heard that name in decades.

436
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,510
Vampire lab rats,coded subject names.I thought you guys shut down 60 years ago.

437
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,610
You thought wrong.

438
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,630
You know how I said I wasn't gonna kill you?I lied.

439
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,340
Atomized vervain.When working with vampires,you can never be too careful.

440
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,950
I'm sure Augustine will be thrilled to have you back.
