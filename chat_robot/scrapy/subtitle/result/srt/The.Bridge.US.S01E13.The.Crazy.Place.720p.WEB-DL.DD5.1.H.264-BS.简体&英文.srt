你去给人跪舔也是机会吗

147
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,640
是她强奸我

148
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,770

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,590
那都是我应该做的
I was only doing what I had to do.

151
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,030
那我现在是做我应该做的  保护自己
Well, now I' doing what I have to do: protect myself.

152
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,500
你要不要跟我一起
Are you with me?

153
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,750
好  该死的
Yeah. Shit.

154
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,300
抱歉  宝贝
I'm sorry, babe.

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,690
给我放尊重点
Show me some respect.

156
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,180
怎么了  你屁股很性感
What? You have a great ass.

157
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,630
我是情不自禁
I couldn't help myself.

158
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,530
你现在是我手下
You work for me now.

159
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,890
凯撒拍我的屁股吗
Does Cesar slap my ass?

160
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,180
没有  夫人
No, senora.

161
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,310
埃尔帕索警局总部

162
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,620
你不会放手的对不对
You're not giving up on this, huh?

163
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,020
我就知道你会来
I knew you'd come.

164
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,470
见到你也很高兴
It's good to see you too.

165
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,260
西莉亚来找过我
Celia came to me.

166
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,430
她在警局看到过伊娃・格拉
She saw Eva Guerra at the police station.

167
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,800
什么
What?

168
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,390
她被关起来了吗
She's in custody?

169
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,750
没有
Nope.

170
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,440
她现在不在那里了
She's not there anymore.

171
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,480
所以她...
So she..

172
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,270
从你们警局消失了吗
disappeared from your police station?

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,880
这个我也不清楚
I don't know that.

174
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,210
西莉亚看到她了
Celia saw her.

175
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,500
目前我就只知道这个
That's all I know right now.

176
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,360
你跟你们队长说过吗
Did you go to your captain with this?

177
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,310
我需要先跟我信任的人说
I needed to talk to someone I trust first.

178
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,810
桑娅
Sonya...

179
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,800
这种事肯定是很复杂
Something like this has many layers.

180
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,450
也很危险
It's dangerous.

181
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,570
你得小心
You need to be careful.

182
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,200
我知道
I know.

183
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,060
我们得小心
We need to be careful.

184
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,810
这是什么玩意  蛋糕吗
What is that shit-- cupcakes?

185
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,860
今天是你第一天回来
It's for your firs day back.

186
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,580
我跟你说过我不想大张旗鼓
I told you I didn't want a big deal out of it.

187
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,800
就是大事嘛
It is a big deal.

188
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,680
来吧  看大家假装想念你会很有意思的
Come on, it'll be fun watching people pretend they missed you.

189
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,050
我只想回来工作  知道吗
Look, I just want t get back to work, all right?

190
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,720
泰特的事我们以后再告诉地方检察官
Maybe we talk to the DA about Tate, maybe...

191
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,380
雪莉想让你慢慢恢复状态
Sherry wants to ease you back in.

192
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,050
慢慢恢复状态
Ease me back in?

193
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,780
什么意思  去吉瓦尼斯俱乐部开个会吗
What does that mean? A Kiwanis club meeting?

194
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
米莉・昆塔纳这周六要满一百岁了
Millie Quintana turns a hundred this Saturday.

195
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,570
四百个词  要感人
400 words, heartwarming.

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,570
我宁愿自戳双目也不想写那种故事
I'd rather stab a pencil in my eye than write that story.

197
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,700
别吃什么蛋糕了  上车  我们走
Let's skip the cupcakes. Get in, let's go.

198
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,390
我们去搞定那个故事吧
Let's get it over with.

199
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,620
活得真够久啊
Oh, my God old people.

200
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,540
谁会想活上一百岁啊
Who wants to be a hundred anyway?

201
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,630
友好一点
Be nice.

202
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,860
电视机开着呢
The television's on.

203
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,510
阿德里亚娜
Hey, Adriana.

204
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,330
情况不妙
That does not look good.

205
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:31,850
她可能受伤了
She could be hurt.

206
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,000
到处看看  看看有没有后门  窗户之类的
Go, uh... go around, see I there's a back door, window.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,880
女士
Hey! Hey, lady.

208
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,720
女士
Hey! Lady.

209
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,210
她死了
She's dead.

210
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,220
我到处看看
I'm gonna look around.

211
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,280
我嘞个去
Holy shit.

212
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,510
我去
Shit.

213
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,020
我们得抓紧时间
We need to hurry.

214
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,850
你确定你看到她了吗
Are you sure you saw her in here?

215
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,510
确定  是三天前
Yes, three days ago.

216
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,680
那为什么系统里查不到
Then why is she not in the system.

217
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,470
不知道  但她确实出现过
I don't know. she was in here.

218
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,980
这里  停
There. Stop.

219
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,490
是她
It's her.

220
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,210
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

221
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,670
看不出是谁
No, I can't tell.

222
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,510
马可
Marco.

223
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,930
糟了
Oh, shit.

224
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,600
在工作吗

225
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,460
对

226
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,350
什么案子

227
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,000
里维拉德尔布拉沃的枪击案

228
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,780
这案子我没听说过

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,010
家暴  应该是家里吵架什么的

230
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,820
你真敬业  马可

231
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,900
非常敬业

232
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,730
哥们  为什么不眼瞎一下
Oh, hey, mama, why don't you hook a gimp up

233
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,260
不小心把什么扔到我车上呢
and throw a little somethin' somethin' in the back of my car?

234
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,030
有什么消息
What you got?

235
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,390
没人愿意透漏  但这真的是一大笔钱啊
Nobody would go on the record, but it's a lot o money.

236
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,580
一大笔是多少
No shit, Sherlock define a lot.

237
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,840
我听说是三千万
About $30 million is the number I heard.

238
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,860
一个老人守着巨款去世啊
Ooh. So, some old bitty dies baby-sitting a cartel fortune.

239
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,080
第一天回来上班就遇上这种事  真不赖啊
I'd say it's a pretty decent first day back at work, wouldn't you?

240
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,260
不仅如此
That's not all.

241
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,740
还有一半是欧元
Half of it's euros.

242
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,570
不会吧
No shit.

243
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,850
是啊
Yeah.

244
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,620
谢谢  非常感谢
Thanks. I appreciate it.

245
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,610
想猜猜到底是多少吗
Want to take a guess on th final count?

246
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,680
五千万美金
Uh, 50 million bucks.

247
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,750
为了从中捞一点  警方通常会估计的少一些
Cops always estimate low in case they can pocket some.

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,300
四千万美元
$40 million.

249
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
我猜的很接近
I was close.

250
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,250
还有两千万欧元
And 20 million euros.

251
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,560
那就是大约六千五百万美元
Wow. It's-it's like $65 million U.S.

252
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,160
两种货币都是面值一百的和二十的
All a hundreds and twenties, both currencies.

253
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,180
为什么还会有欧元
What is up with the whole euro thing?

254
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,050
这才是奇怪之处
That's the story it's weird.

255
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,970
真的很奇怪
It's really weird.

256
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,300
但是我喜欢  奇怪是好事
But I like it. Weird is good.

257
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,610
这是给你的
This came for you.

258
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,400
谢谢
Thank you.

259
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,810
那是什么
What the hell is that?

260
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,690
钱给你了
米莉・昆塔纳是谁

261
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,970
"米莉・昆塔纳是谁"
"Who is Millie Quintana?"

262
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,150
我来开车  佩德罗
I'm driving, Pedro.

263
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,030
你个混蛋

264
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,190
随你怎么说
Whatever.

265
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,220
屁都不懂的白人小子

266
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,770
把婴儿床挪到后面的房间

267
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,220
我得挂了

268
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,250
她在哪

269
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,940
我不懂你说什么

270
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,100
警察局出现过的那个女孩

271
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,700
她叫伊娃

272
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,450
你那晚当班

273
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,890
是不是有个派对

274
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,120
没有
No.

275
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,870
你在说谎

276
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,020
马可  别趟这浑水

277
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,980
我已经趟了

278
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,710
水都快淹到我屁股了

279
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,650
告诉我她在哪里

280
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,820
她怎么了

281
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,780
你给我小心点

282
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,780
你干了什么
What did you do?

283
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,700
她还活着
She's alive.

284
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,180
你说你知道我们要去哪的
You said you knew where we were going.

285
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,190
我知道
I do.

286
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,170
我们错过高速入口了
We missed the highway.

287
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,330
这条路更安全  雷
It's safer this way, Ray.

288
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,370
我过去常开着
Shit, man. I took fast boats

289
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,310
载满毒品的快船进入迈阿密
loaded to the rails with coke into Miami,

290
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,240
却一次都没被截停过  知道为什么吗
never got stopped once. You know why?

291
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,260
为什么  雷
Why, Ray?

292
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,040
因为我他妈的不在乎别人看到
It's 'cause I didn't give a shit about not being seen.

293
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,610
就像电影《现代启示录》里的那一幕
It's like that scene in Apocalypse Now

294
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,300
鲍比逼那些小子冲浪
where Bobby makes those boys go surfing

295
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
后面还有查理朝着他们的屁股开枪
with Charlie firing on their ass.

296
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,910
我没看过
I've never seen it.

297
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,070
我的意思是  偷偷摸摸反而更惹人怀疑
The point is, all this creeping around is what draw suspicion.

298
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,460
我要调头
I'm turning around.

299
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,030
-停车  -为什么
- Stop the truck. - Why?

300
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,430
我要下车
I want to get off.

301
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,580
感觉不太对
This isn't good.

302
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,610
我可不停
I ain't stopping.

303
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,260
爷们点行吗  兄弟
Grow some huevos, bro.

304
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,150
该死的美国佬

305
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,140
这是什么地方
What is this place?

306
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,420
这曾经是个修道院
Used to be a monastery.

307
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
现在是受难者的庇护所
Now it's a house for the damned.

308
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,340
伊娃在这里吗
And Eva's here?

309
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,560
是的  如果我们运气好的话
If we're lucky, yes.

310
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,210
他本来应该杀了她
He was supposed to kill her

311
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,300
把她埋在沙漠里
and bury her in the desert.

312
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,920
我们一会再谈这个
We'll talk about it later.

313
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,890
晚上好

314
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,360
马可・鲁伊兹  警察
Marco Ruiz. Policia.

315
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,940
谢谢

316
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,340
有人问起过她吗

317
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,870
没有  她来的时候情况很糟

318
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,820
她在这里很安全

319
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,370
不  修女

320
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,800
她在这不安全

321
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,570
跟我来

322
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,270
这边

323
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,110
她在这里

324
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,600
她来之后没说过一句话

325
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,760
看上去像被人下了药

326
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,870
我们要带她走

327
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,860
如果你们一定要这样

328
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,980
是的  修女  我们必须得带走她

329
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,000

00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,260
你安全了

跟我们走  好吗

他是好人
He's okay.

333
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,970
他是好人
He's okay.

334
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,890
她被带去了一个派对
She was taken to a party...

335
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,750
下药  强奸
drugged, raped...

336
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,540
天知道还干了什么
who knows what else?

337
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,890
有警察参与吗
Police?

338
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,130
有一些
Some.

339
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,720
我们得揭发他们
We need to fix this.

340
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,450
现在不行  桑娅

341
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,480
她留在墨西哥不安全
She-she's not safe in Mexico.

342
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,510
我们得把她带到美国境内
We need to get her across the border.

343
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,830
我有个朋友
I have this friend.

344
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,240
他是急救员
He's a paramedic.

345
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,390
他能弄到救护车

346
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,150
帮助她穿过边境

You sit in the back, show your badge at the border.

348
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,130

All right? You should not have any problems.

349
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,770
好吧
All right.

353
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,860

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,300
我不知道还能打给谁

她需要治疗

卡门正从医院赶回来

她会尽力而为

358
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,080
但我怕...她需要的不止这些
But... she might need more.

359
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,260
来吧  宝贝

366
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,670
用救护车

367
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,190
马可找了人帮忙

368
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,910
还有谁知道她在这里

369
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
没别人了
Nobody.

370
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,260
你不准备告诉我发生了什么吗
So, you want to tell me what this is about?

371
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,030
华瑞兹的警察把她弄成这样的
Cops in Juarez did this to her.

372
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,390
马可让我别管这事
Marco told me to stay out of it.

373
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,940
那就让他处理吧
Yeah, well, let him handle it.

374
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,560
以他现在的状态不行
He's in no shape to handle it.

375
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
他还处于丧子之痛中
He's grieving.

376
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,040
我昨天看见他把一个男人揍得半死

380
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,130

目前  什么也没有

你今天晚上怎么这么闲

你把那家伙打了一顿

你想宰了戴维・泰特

438
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,080
他会坐牢
He'll go to trial.

439

我不知道  也不在乎

00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,680
不在我的掌控之下

447
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,490
当然  他是个好人
Of course not. He's a good man.

448
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,110
我不会有事的  桑娅
I'll be okay, Sonya.

449
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,400
-好的  -好的
- Okay. - Okay.

450
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,520
我无能为力
There's nothing I can do.

451
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,240
别担心
Don't worry.

452
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,360
我不会干傻事的
I won't do anything stupid.

453
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,460
我知道
I know.

454
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,640
你是个好人
You're a good man.

455
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,970
好的
All right.

456
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,450
晚安
Have a good night.

457
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:05,570
?Do you know how I feel?

458
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,460
?How I feel about you?

459
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,400
?Do you know this is real?

460
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,250
?How I feel around you?

461
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:52,990
?When I see you look at me?

462
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:58,660
?I'm not sure of anything?

463
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,620
All I know is, when you smile?

464
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,690
I believe in everything...?

465
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:16,120
Do you know how I dream?

466
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:22,040
How I dream about you?

467
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,020
Do you know how I feel?

468
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,720
请把靴子脱了
Take your boots off please

469
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,230
Do you know how I feel?

470
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,700
How I feel about you?

471
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,600
Doesn't take much to tell?

472
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,480
That I love, oh, I...?

473
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,300
埃琳娜给我打电话了

474
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,180
丹妮拉出事了

475
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,770
她没下公共汽车

476
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,990
But you're nowhere near?

477
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,180
No, you're nowhere near...?

478
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,010
妈妈
Madre...

479
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,150
No, you're nowhere near?

480
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,930
Oh, oh, oh..?

481
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,180
Oh, oh, oh?

482
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,660
Oh, oh, oh..?

483
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,270
Oh, oh, oh?

484
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,340
对你的丧子之痛我深表同情

485
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,340
喝一杯吗

486
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,990
谢谢
Gracias.

487
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,380
再来一杯吧

488
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,100
我不知道还能给谁打电话

489
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,810
这20年你没求过我

490
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,500
你不想欠我人情

491
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,810
这回是怎么回事

492
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,570
我现在什么都不在乎了

493
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,320
合情合理

494
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,560
你在监狱里有人吧

495
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,200
有

496
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,460
埃尔帕索那边呢

497
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,310
哪里都有

498
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
如果有人

499
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,600
单独拘禁

500
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,220
受到严密保护

501
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,170
杀你儿子的那个畜生吗

502
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,730
不太容易

503
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,800
但不是没有可能

504
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,260
只要你说话  我马上去办  马可

505
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,420
我会为你宰了他

506
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,250
不
No

507
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,150
我想亲手宰了他
