00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the more you think you see,

00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but what you're really doing is filtering, interpreting,

9

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}searching for meaning.

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and use it against you.

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not this one. That's too obvious.

17
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pay close attention.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was too fast. I'll do it again.

19

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready?

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because you're looking too closely.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what have I been telling you all night?

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The closer you look,

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The less you see.

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,950


30
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now look into my eyes.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And sleep. Okay.

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And...

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can get this bill from me, you can have it.

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

35
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can say your name, you can have it.

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

37
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood of your hubby's brain.

38
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,730

40
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't tell me. - Of course.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beach. Cocktails.

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florida?

43
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, it was a business trip.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it is a kind of business.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe the oldest business.

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

47

00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Janet?

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know Janet?

55
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not your best friend, is it?

56
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your sister? - No, please.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her sister? Oh, my God.

58
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You weren't away on business.

59
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You were away on Janet. - No.

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your wife's sister!

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, we need to move over here,

62
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it seems like she's a little bit upset right now.

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want this to go away?

64

66
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you shake down everybody like this?

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, only the special few.

68
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

70
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a stick-up artist.

71
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Of course.

72
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, and sleep!

73
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, when I snap my fingers,

74
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you won't remember any of this.

75
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, Warren Beatty,

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}every time you see or even think of Janet,

77
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're gonna picture me naked.

78
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's not a pretty sight.

79
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

80
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And... You're wide awake!

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we did the best we could,

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but some people just aren't to be hypnotized.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I did it wrong? - Come on, Honey Bee.

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, you did it fine.

85
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me buy you dinner.

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look after her.

87
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just have to hit an ATM first.

88
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,820


89
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, I am the next great magician,

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I will give $100 to anyone who can tell me how this trick is done.

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,

92
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}right here in Brooklyn.

93
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out.

94
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, everyone please pay very, very close attention.

95
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm about to bend this spoon with my mind.

96
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,590

98
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this! Looks like we got a spoon and a stem.

99
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got other tricks.

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

101
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said you would.

102

106
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wallet. My watch!

107
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop that guy!

108
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got my wallet!

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,600


111
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Los Angeles,

112
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are we ready to end this thing?

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

114
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When that timer hits zero,

115
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

116
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will fall from above.

117
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

118
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three!

119
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Stop it!

120
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's serious! She can't get out!

121
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get some help!

122
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help, dude!

123
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of the way! Move! Move!

124
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! This is bullshit!

125
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

126
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am your biggest fan.

127
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could tell by the way you're attacking my face right now.

128
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the door. Bad apartment building.

129
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Magician, come here. - Okay.

130
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait, wait. - What? What?

131
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you do that...

132
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The seven of diamonds on the side of the tower?

133
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - That's a trade secret.

134
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you a hint. It involved bribing the tower electrician.

135
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much?

136
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}50 bucks.

137
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But it's so hard. - Oh, thank you.

138
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it always a seven?

139
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could do that trick 52 different ways.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

141
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see what I can do.

142
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magic man!

143
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love your shampoo.

144
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hold up. - What?

145
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to leave.

146
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?

147
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

148
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this what you do?

149
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

150
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,850


151
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"45 East Evan Street."

152
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

153
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have my number.

154
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

155
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are such an asshole.

156
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,540


157
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,340


158
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,950


159
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henley.

160
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danny? Hey.

161
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a card, huh?

162
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no, it's good for you. Congratulations.

163
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

164
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go inside. I'm gonna scope the place out.

165
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wait out here. I will come back and get you, okay?

166
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not come in.

167
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

168
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice hair.

169
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, actually, what have you been up to?

170
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you know exactly what I've been up to, Danny.

171
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw all your anonymous posting on my website.

172
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a website. That's good.

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good for you. Get the word out.

174
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So apparently none of us was the only one chosen.

175
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me be the first one to kick my ego to the curb.

176
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Excuse me.

177
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Door's locked. - Is it? I'll check.

178
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

179
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Helen? No, no.

180
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henley.

181
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's on your coffee cup.

182
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for keeping me honest.

183
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

184
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just an observation.

185
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Second observation, you are beautiful.

186
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

187
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good. That's very nice. Very well-polished. Nice bit.

188
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very nice. I know who you are and I just want to say that

190
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not interested in you doing your mentalism thing on us.

191
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially when we don't know

192
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who brought us here or even if it's real.

193
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, I'm sensing... I'm sensing you are a control freak.

194
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, have we met before?

195
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

196
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a control freak.

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I take that as a compliment.

198
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only he would take it as a compliment.

199
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

200
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. So that's why you're no longer a couple.

201
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A couple? No, no.

202
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were never a couple.

203
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to saw me in half.

204
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was a very good assistant.

205
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I was too fat for Danny.

206
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I said that one time because of the trap door.

207
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There were specs. - You built it this size.

208
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one could fit through there. No one.

209
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rebecca fit through.

210

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if he was arrogant and all of his miracles were fake.

258

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Wait, did you?

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

263
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great.

315
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are looking at row number 5.

316
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is that?

317
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Henley, could I please have a random seat number?

318
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Lucky number 13.

319
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B-5-13. Where are you?

320
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

321
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you just confirm for me

322
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

323
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

324
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Wonderful. Now, could you please tell us

325
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your name and the name of your bank?

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

327
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my bank, it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

328
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}French. Okay.

329
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were hoping for something a little more local,

330
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a kind of mom-and-pop credit union with no security.

331
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

332
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you please come up to the stage

333
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we'll rob your bank.

334
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And while he does that,

335
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is someone here tonight

336
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without whom we would just be

337
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}four magicians working the circuit,

338
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to get, well, actually, trying to get here.

339
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You probably know this man,

340
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if not from one of the many, many companies he puts his name on.

341
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

342
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Arthur Tressler.

343
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

344
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only man here with

345
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Queen's cell phone number.

346
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

347
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to say that

348
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when we came to Mr. Tressler,

349
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we promised that, as a unit, we could become

350
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the biggest name in magic.

351
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

352
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by the way, Art, you notice on the sign out front,

353
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we made sure we put your name on top.

354
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you turn out to be as good

355
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as you think you are, dear girl,

356
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that won't be necessary much longer.

357
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't done our closer yet.

358
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you watch it

359
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then you can decide for yourself.

360
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

361
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. And, of course, once again,

362
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Cardinal of Clairvoyance, Merritt McKinney.

363
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Etienne, what Jack is bringing to the stage now,

364
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is what we in the magic world call a teleportation helmet.

365
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will need to wear this, as it will allow you

366
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to literally fold through space and time

367
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to your bank in the

368
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}8th?

369
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- 9th arrondissement. - Yeah.

370
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, once you are there,

371
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will be able to speak with you through this helmet.

372
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now if...

373
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

374
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has the added attraction of being very stylish.

375
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about time the French learned from America on that subject.

376
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

377
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you. Thank you... - it is.

378
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Thank you very much.

379
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But before you go anywhere,

380
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could you please, pick a card, any card.

381
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that card.

382
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's an old American joke. You can take that one.

383
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. This one?

384
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show it to your friends in Section B. But not to us.

385
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, great. Now if you could just sign your name there.

386
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - In English, if possible.

387
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's good. - Thanks.

388
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put it in your pocket.

389
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now for one tiny detail.

390
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Etienne, let's step into this cockamamie contraption.

391
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.

392
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's 11:50 p.m. Here in Vegas.

393
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And 8:50 a.m. In Paris.

394
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

395
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One,

396
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}two,

397
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three.

398
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

399
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Etienne? - Etienne?

400
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't supposed to happen like that, was it?

401
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Etienne?

402
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I liked that little French guy.

403
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did he go?

404
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,750


405
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, there he is.

406
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

407
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

408
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Etienne? Are you okay?

409
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

410
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect. What do you see in there?

411
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Money.

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this real?

413
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Looks like three million or so Euros' worth.

414
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, now, here's what we're gonna need you to do.

415
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to take the card that you signed

416
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out of your pocket.

417
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want you to take the ticket stub

418
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from tonight's show

419
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I want you to put it right there

420
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the middle of the money.

421
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now drop it.

422
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,140


423
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, on the side of your helmet you should feel a button.

424
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't press it just yet.

425
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That button activates an air duct

426
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

427
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, good. Now you can press it.

428
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

429
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

430
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second.

431
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah merde!

432
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

433
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are The Four Horsemen.

434
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And good night!

435
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night!

436
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold up here.

437
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan Rhodes.

438
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

439
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say magicians?

440
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

441
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you now?

442
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm at Aria. I'm heading up there to grab 'em now.

443
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}FBI! Hands where I can see them.

444
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

445
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go. Get 'em up.

446
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the book down.

447
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. You got me.

448
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Freeze! Hands in the air! - Oh, my!

449
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do one of you guys mind giving us a hand with our bags?

450
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

451
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

452
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just got Willy Mears to finger Paulie Attanasio.

453
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a month, two tops,

454
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}away from blowing this whole thing open.

455
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get Turkelson.

456
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in Atlantic City.

457
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Cowan? Look at him.

458
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just sitting there on his ass.

459
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hilarious, Rhodes.

460
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

461
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Asshole.

462
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have time for this magic crap.

463
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This crap just pulled three million Euro

464
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out of a Parisian bank.

465
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's how much they got? - Yeah.

466
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, 3.2.

467
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is she?

468
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

469
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alma Dray from Interpol.

470
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be working the investigation with you.

471
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be kidding me.

472
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,910


473
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's bad enough they got me chasing down

474
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}David Copperfield and Friends.

475
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I'm being saddled with, no offense, with Interpol?

476
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I look forward to working with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

477
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna need your help on this. Okay?

478
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the French guy?

479
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already spoke to him.

480
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you did? You spoke to my witness before me?

481
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your witness? I thought you didn't want the case.

482
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, he's useless.

483
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? Why is that?

484
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he believes their magic was real.

485
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he believes the magic was real?

486
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right, he probably is useless.

487
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

488
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

489
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

490
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to give the money back, but they won't take it.

491
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay, okay, let's just say you robbed a bank.

492
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I did. - Fine. Fantastic. You did.

493
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But since I'm new to this, can you explain to me

494
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how you went from Las Vegas

495
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to Paris in three seconds?

496
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the teleportation helmet.

497
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what the hell is going on here?

498
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was hypnotized during the show.

499
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you, he's useless.

500
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

501
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with this other bullshit.

502
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}During the show, half the audience was hypnotized

503
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

504
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that "Bullshit" Was the trigger word.

505
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Hey, hey. Ecoutez. Etienne, come on down from there.

506
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not in the Philharmonic.

507
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you say "Stop" In French? - Stop.

508
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him to stop.

509
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I can't. You just have to let him finish his movement.

510
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I need a time-out.

511
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too many French people in one room.

512
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Rhodes!

513
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ordered by my bosses to provide a report.

514
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And until we have one,

515
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here, like it or not.

516
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we can work together,

517
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or you can continue to follow behind

518
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

519
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's up to you.

520
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not finished.

521
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just flew 12 hours, after what was already a long day.

522
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I do not handle jet lag well.

523
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

524
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you, you will lose.

525
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. So which one of these idiots

526
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do you want to talk to first?

527
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Him?

528
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan, for the record,

529
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mentalism has never actually been proven to be accurate.

530
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

531
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is to say, that it's not a science.

532
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's more for entertainment.

533
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

534
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't believe everything the guy says. That's all.

535
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please convey my deepest apologies

536
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to your colleague out there.

537
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really sorry about this whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

538
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was out of line.

539
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tranny Tuesday?

540
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's an arrangement he and his wife have.

541
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or might not have, if you believe

542
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything Agent Fuller is saying to be correct.

543
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But isn't there a proud tradition

544
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the FBI of men wearing dresses?

545
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

546
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just having fun.

547
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was this your card? No.

548
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I knew you weren't a queen of hearts lady,

549
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I respect that.

550
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The trick usually works better when I'm not strapped in here,

551
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I understand protocol.

552
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

553
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, if you had nothing to do with it,

554
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then how did the playing card get into the vault?

555
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes. That would be...

556
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do the kids call it these days?

557
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

558
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

559
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

560
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

561
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says here you are a mentalist.

562
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What exactly is mentalism?

563
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tricks, mostly. Some science.

564
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Targeted guessing might be a most apt description.

565
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Along with some intuition and the occasional...

566
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}voices in my head.

567
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says here you were fairly famous at one point.

568
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can even hypnotize people over the phone.

569
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some big tours around the U.S for a few years.

570
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two TV specials.

571
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glory days.

572
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then your brother/manager

573
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}disappeared with all your hard-earned money.

574
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did your research, did you?

575
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}IRS audit. Back taxes.

576
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've had a long hard slog back into the limelight,

577
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

578
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, indeed, it has.

579
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I do appreciate that trip down Memory Lane.

580
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far as I understand it, when the man from Paris

581
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}put on the magical helmet...

582
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me.

583
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you didn't rob that bank, then you knew about it.

584
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which makes you an accomplice.

585
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you wanna walk out of here today, I'd suggest you start...

586
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you listen to me, unless you think

587
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

588
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who'd be willing to make sense of this to a jury,

589
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then we have a show to perform.

590
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, Agent Rhodes,

591
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have a drawing board to get back to.

592
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this your first date?

593
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

594
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I mean, obviously,

595
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you guys don't know each other well, if at all.

596
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, like, there is a palpable tension in this room.

597
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And before you get involved,

598
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you should consider the fact that she has a lot of big secrets.

599
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know the first one is that

600
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

601
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have said something to him.

602
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a weird way for you to find out.

603
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are literally begging to be arrested. You know that?

604
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it means you would actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

605
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because if you did, it means that you,

606
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the FBI,

607
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your friends at Interpol,

608
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}actually believe, at an institutional level, in magic.

609
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The press would have a field day.

610
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'd be even more famous than we already are.

611
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you guys would look like idiots

612
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even more then you already are.

613
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

614
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have, what we in the business, like to call,

615
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Nothing up your sleeve."

616
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know it.

617
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't draw him in and then dump him

618
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because abandonment is a big "Area" For him.

619
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy?

620
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy.

621
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have big daddy issues.

622
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay, that's enough. - I'll tell you what.

623
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your average therapist

624
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is gonna charge you $200-$300 for this sesh.

625
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? I'll take a tenner.

626
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

627
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll still take a tenner.

628
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna know who sat in that chair before you?

629
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

630
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know who put them there?

631
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy who's sitting in this chair.

632
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I warn you, I can maintain my resolve much longer

633
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than you can maintain that phony arrogance.

634
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the instant that you even show

635
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the slightest crack in that smug facade,

636
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be there.

637
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will be all over you like...

638
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like white on rice?

639
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. That's unfair.

640
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me warn you.

641
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to follow.

642
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because no matter what you think you might know,

643
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will always be one step,

644
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}three steps, seven steps ahead of you.

645
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And just when you think you're catching up,

646
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's when we'll be right behind you.

647
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And at no time will you be anywhere other than

648
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}exactly where I want you to be.

649
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So come close. Get all over me,

650
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because the closer you think you are,

651
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the less you'll actually see.

652
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna nail you...

653
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

654
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Shit!

655
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First rule of magic.

656
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always be the smartest guy in the room.

657
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boss, what are we doing?

658
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're letting them go?

659
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They all but admitted they're gonna do it again.

660
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About a half an hour ago, you didn't give a damn about them.

661
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What changed? - I met them.

662
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Guys.

663
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

664
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most of it was just filler.

665
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People that Tressler dragged in to pack the room.

666
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But guess who was sitting there in the back,

667
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}filming the whole damn thing?

668
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

669
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thaddeus Bradley.

670
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thaddeus Bradley, the guy from TV

671
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the DVDs and shows?

672
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

673
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

674
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He exposes them. He shows you how to do their tricks.

675
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him on the phone.

676
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

677
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

678
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Bradley started as a magician.

679
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He was actually quite good. - Really?

680
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One of the best. - You don't say.

681
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The greatest genius is in seeing through the illusion."

682
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a man who loves his work.

683
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure I can't interest you in a glass of wine?

684
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.

685
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thank you, sir. We're working.

686
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will take one.

687
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's incredible. That's amazing.

688
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red dye, palmed.

689
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,610


690
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that how Jesus did it?

691
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's incredible.

692
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

693
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were one of the great magicians.

694
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you stop?

695
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how many people went to see magic performed live

696
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the last half decade?

697
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About 1.6 million.

698
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how many DVDs I sold in the same period?

699
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five million.

700
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, so it's about the money.

701
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the money is only there

702
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because the need to know is greater than the desire to be fooled.

703
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like you, I detest those

704
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

705
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all due respect,

706
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

707
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cost?

708
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Careers.

709
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lives.

710
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

711
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, who?

712
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lionel Shrike.

713
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A middling magician who drowned

714
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

715
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On Mr. Bradley's first special,

716
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

717
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next year, Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

718
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was shackled inside a safe,

719
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and dropped into the river.

720
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he never resurfaced.

721
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean he died?

722
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't kill him.

723
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He killed himself

724
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to do something he wasn't prepared to handle.

725
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do realize this is a game?

726
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me, it's not a game.

727
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a game.

728
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the game. You're being played.

729
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your pathetic attempts at fawning to gain my trust.

730
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, come on.

731
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got me.

732
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you really want to know

733
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how a bank in Paris was robbed

734
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from a stage in Las Vegas,

735
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my special comes out next month.

736
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or I could just bring you in on obstruction charges

737
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and force you to tell me.

738
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless, of course, what you're trying to say to me is that

739
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you actually don't know how they did it.

740
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Showmanship and theatrics.

741
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When a magician waves his hand and says,

742
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"This is where the magic is happening."

743
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The real trick is happening somewhere else.

744
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

745
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not interested in the concepts of magic.

746
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

747
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're an idiot if you think they robbed a bank.

748
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But don't take my word for it.

749
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a trip to Paris?

750
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hermia, the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

751
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're joking, right?

752
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna know how they did it or not?

753
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just gonna put this on your head.

754
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step right up.

755
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

756
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we just pull this down all safe and snug.

757
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make yourself comfortable.

758
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There we go.

759
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when you're ready to go to Paris,

760
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just say the magic word.

761
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blow me?

762
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That'll suffice. - Bon voyage.

763
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bonjour!

764
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

765
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

766
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

767
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My fun.

768
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

769
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

770
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they got a vault set.

771
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

772
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's the exact replica

773
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the little French guy's bank.

774
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he's a plant.

775
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a dupe, not a plant.

776
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They chose him. They knew which seat he was in.

777
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

778
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless, of course, the audience didn't pick the seat.

779
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They let them think they picked the seat.

780
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll choose one at random then.

781
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, they were just palming the ball

782
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the seat number they wanted.

783
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are looking at row number 5.

784
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henley, could I please have a seat number?

785
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucky number 13.

786
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you just confirm that this is, in fact, your seat?

787
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was selected.

788
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They programmed his mind to make him go to Las Vegas.

789
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Viva Las Vegas.

790
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

791
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They trailed him.

792
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They studied him.

793
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing was left to chance.

794
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got his measurements.

795
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had no idea he was their target.

796
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they simply activated him in Vegas.

797
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I snap my fingers...

798
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And once again, Merritt McKinney.

799
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how did they know what bank was his?

800
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're kidding. - Really?

801
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you be any more of a condescending ass?

802
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

803
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like this.

804
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a very rare, very mysterious way

805
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in which a magician divines an audience member's bank.

806
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ready?

807
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

808
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Credit card.

809
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's how they got the signature for the card

810
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they left in the vault in Paris.

811
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very good.

812
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

813
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, but they had to get the signature card in the vault.

814
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said they didn't steal the money.

815
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

816
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said they didn't rob the bank.

817
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My guess is that they targeted

818
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a shipment of freshly minted money

819
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}headed to the Frenchman's bank on-board an armored truck.

820
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which, of course, is just as hard to break into.

821
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless you're already inside.

822
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And despite what the banks would have you believe,

823
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the men who drive these trucks are not exactly mental giants.

824
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For our Horsemen,

825
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it was almost too easy.

826
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, boys.

827
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how did they make the fake money disappear from the vault?

828
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that?

829
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flash paper.

830
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:23,860


831
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magicians use it all the time.

832
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

833
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah merde!

834
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,

835
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.

836
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think these guys have cracked the secret to show business.

837
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give your audience $3 million.

838
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

839
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Best finale ever.

840
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna be the first magicians in history to get laid.

841
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,720


842
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

843
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- put it on the lawyer first. Remember. - Oh, yes.

844
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always do. It's lawyer first,

845
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-then myself and then the children. - Then yourself.

846
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Then the children.

847
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allow me to make plain what we've both been thinking.

848
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's that?

849
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, obviously, you have feelings of affection for Daniel.

850
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unrequited and misguided,

851
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}owing to his lack of emotional availability.

852
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Consequently, you're very tightly...

853
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How should I put it?

854
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Corked.

855
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I am?

856
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, recognizing that you have physical needs not being met,

857
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and strictly in the vein of helping a sister out,

858
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I invite you to think of me as your own personal corkscrew.

859
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Thanks.

860
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me mull over that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

861
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheap and meaningless, maybe, but not time-consuming.

862
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should be getting there a few minutes early.

863
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, sit back, relax.

864
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should be in the Big Easy soon.

865
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,000


866
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Appreciate you flying with us today.

867
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's in it for Tressler, besides the money?

868
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ego.

869
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, pick your card.

870
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

871
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't tell me.

872
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay. -Okay.

873
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thaddeus was there that night.

874
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows exactly how they pulled it off. What about him?

875
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you saying?

876
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think they could be working together.

877
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. All I know is that these guys

878
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were a bunch of street magicians

879
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a year ago with no resources.

880
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how do they go from doing that to this

881
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without some kind of outside help?

882
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this your card?

883
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, my card is sitting over there in that guy's lap.

884
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice shuffle.

885
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, this is hard.

886
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to this book,

887
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some of those guys practice

888
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one simple move eight hours a day for years.

889
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Some of those guys seriously need to get a life.

890
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it magicians, in general, you have a problem with?

891
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or specifically those guys?

892
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could care less about magicians in general.

893
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I hate is people who exploit other people.

894
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exploit them how?

895
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try again.

896
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

897
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their need to believe in something that's unexplainable

898
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in order to make their lives more bearable.

899
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see it as a strength.

900
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My life is happier when I believe that.

901
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this your card?

902
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

903
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

904
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - Cool.

905
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That smile on your face. Is it real?

906
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

907
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

908
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you feel exploited?

909
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or did you have maybe a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

910
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy goes to the doctor.

911
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna have to stop masturbating."

912
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He Says, "Why?"

913
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says, "So I can finish the examination."

914
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

915
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-my role in the show real quick? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

916
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys.

917
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a show to prepare for.

918
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we now?

919
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, don't do that.

920
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not doing that thing to me. No.

921
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What thing? I'm just looking at you.

922
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're not. I've been watching you for a year.

923
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know all of your little tricks.

924
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That what they are to you? Tricks?

925
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it's gimmicks. It's Barnum statements.

926
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,100


927
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

928
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's such an easy thing, why don't you do Henley?

929
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

930
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

931
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

932
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do me.

933
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

934
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

935
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even better.

936
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Art. - Yeah.

937
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

938
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I want to be.

939
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stay with me, okay?

940
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Art, you were a tough kid.

941
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

942
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had a dog. A real tough dog.

943
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A brutish breed. Like a real...

944
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

945
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

946
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

947
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

948
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, let me try one.

949
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can do way better than that. - Let him do it.

950
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, give me one more time. One more time.

951
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can do way better than that.

952
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do family.

953
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had an uncle on your mother's side.

954
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a real, kind of... A real masculine name.

955
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

956
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

957
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like it was some kind of Paul. Thompson? Was it a Paul...

958
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

959
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nearly though. - Was I?

960
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. My uncle's name was Cushman Armitage.

961
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

962
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

963
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was your childhood?

964
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I certainly hope tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

965
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. Just you wait.

966
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Come on, give me some good news on a hotel room, please.

967
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, are you kidding me?

968
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

969
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing within sight of the theater.

970
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on a second. Hold on. Where is this woman?

971
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey! There you are.

972
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, the French girl doing a little sightseeing

973
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while she's in New Orleans?

974
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. In fact, here, speaking French is actually an asset.

975
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you see that woman up there?

976
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Marie Claire.

977
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she has a lovely apartment for us.

978
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're welcome.

979
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

980
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a place.

981
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want two each inside of here. The other 30 around here.

982
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roofs, alleys, balconies.

983
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times. - Yes, sir.

984
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson took the name Chung Ling Soo

985
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,490


986
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and spent his entire life never speaking English in public.

987
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This other guy, Maximillian...

988
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not interested in a history lesson on magic at this moment.

989
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want to keep playing into their hands, go for it.

990
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just trying to understand how they think.

991
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'm playing in their hands, do you?

992
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how any of that is gonna go against this.

993
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This what? This magic?

994
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lionel Shrike.

995
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In Central Park, he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

996
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then he goes to a tree that has been there 20 years.

997
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They saw the tree in half.

998
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inside the tree, encased in glass,

999
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is the card with the signature.

1000
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did he do that?

1001
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea. But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

1002
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excusez-moi

1003
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

1004
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but I do have some good news.

1005
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

1006
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's got his whole crew on those tracking bracelets?

1007
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What tracking bracelets?

1008
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has every member of his crew

1009
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wearing a tracking bracelet.

1010
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.

1011
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So as long as Atlas is tracking them,

1012
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next.

1013
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}our boys can track Atlas from right here

1014
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the mobile command unit.

1015
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, call me if you get any movement.

1016
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copy that.

1017
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

1018
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

1019
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes in the mornings I sit on a bench there.

1020
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I watch the people make a wish

1021
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

1022
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then throw the key into the Seine.

1023
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All day they do this.

1024
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mothers, lovers, old men.

1025
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watching the key sink into the water

1026
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and their secret is locked away forever.

1027
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real and, at the same time, magical.

1028
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,

1029
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do you really think it's possible there's a fifth Horseman?

1030
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1031
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,020


1032
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a legend of a secret order born in ancient Egypt called

1033
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,660

1034
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is said they perfected sleight of hand

1035
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to steal food from the Pharaohs

1036
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and give it to the slaves.

1037
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their purpose?

1038
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Using magic and illusion to even the scales of justice.

1039
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are The Horsemen next in

1040
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a long line of fools to believe this myth?

1041
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will they evade the rules of law and logic

1042
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like they did in Las Vegas?

1043
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or will the dark mysticism of this Southern swampland

1044
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get the better of them?

1045
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

1046
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either you have a cease-and-desist,

1047
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which you don't, or you should leave.

1048
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:05,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I want something to cease or desist,

1049
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it does.

1050
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take five.

1051
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to your potential backers,

1052
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you stand to make 2.5 million tops

1053
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from your best special.

1054
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have here a check

1055
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for 3.5 million.

1056
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To walk away?

1057
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1058
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1059
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're in this to ride them up.

1060
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in it to ride them down.

1061
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take it that we do not have a deal.

1062
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:48,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And therein lies our conflict.

1063
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me be blunt.

1064
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My bank account is much, much bigger than yours.

1065
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my lawyers are much stronger.

1066
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they will manacle you

1067
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with so many injunctions.

1068
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until you stand by,

1069
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hopelessly watching everything that you own

1070
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}drain away in front of your greedy little eyes.

1071
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

1072
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm still here.

1073
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is, however, the first time you've been threatened by me.

1074
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you do anything to sully my investment,

1075
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the ride down, which you mentioned,

1076
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will be sudden, precipitous, and measurable on the Richter scale.

1077
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't have done that.

1078
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to superstition,

1079
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one who uses a doll to enact one's own wrath,

1080
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is likely to bring that very wrath unto himself.

1081
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that funny?

1082
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1083
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do me a favor.

1084
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Visualize your most adventurous sexual experience.

1085
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay out of my head, you perv.

1086
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no, if I stay out of your head,

1087
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1088
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right. - So let's stick with this exercise.

1089
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And it helps... - Pardon the intrusion.

1090
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

1091
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, so you can try to expose us later on your little website?

1092
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And on demand.

1093
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not gonna happen. - Oh, no?

1094
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Operating on a special plane because of The Eye?

1095
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:40,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard it's a lovely place. Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1096
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make any magician's wish come true.

1097
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've come a long way,

1098
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}much further than anyone would have expected of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

1099
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If by "Has-been" You're referring to me,

1100
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1101
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I always considered myself a never-was.

1102
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1103
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By all means.

1104
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1105
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to be a great magician someday.

1106
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And though he's good, he's not quite good enough.

1107
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he ends up at the bottom of the entertainment food chain,

1108
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}feeding off of those who have the talent that he never did.

1109
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me. Am I getting close?

1110
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Before you go. I'm working on something new.

1111
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:26,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a second?

1112
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Name a card.

1113
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- King of hearts. - Knew it.

1114
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1115
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's up your left sleeve. - Is it?

1116
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, I don't see it up there.

1117
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, why don't you check your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1118
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1119
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,190


1120
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Break a leg.

1123

1135
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1136
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who? - Shrike.

1137
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, when he was 14,

1138
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1139
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1140
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sign a card for what looked like a routine little trick.

1141
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

1142
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1143
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1144
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and presto!

1145
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The card is in the tree.

1146
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was in the tree for 18 years.

1147
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The card was in the tree.

1148
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The tree grew around the card in 18 years.

1149
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1150
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is, the trick was not to look closely.

1151
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was to look so far

1152
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you see 20 years into the past.

1153
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After Shrike drowned, they never found the body.

1154
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you suggesting?

1155
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:31,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur Tressler presents

1156
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Wilder,

1157
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henley Reeves,

1158
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merritt McKinney,

1159
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Daniel Atlas.

1160
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Four Horsemen.

1161
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Before we begin,

1162
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'd like to single out two people in particular.

1163
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A man and a woman to whom

1164
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1165
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1166
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,

1167
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1168
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed to "Nail us."

1169
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:07,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we encourage him to do so if he has the brains and the fur.

1170
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is magic?

1171
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our argument, nothing but targeted deception.

1172
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I want you to look.

1173
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look as closely as possible.

1174
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the tricks you are about to see

1175
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}may not seem connected.

1176
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we assure you, they are.

1177
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1178
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or is it one giant illusion?

1179
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now for one of the oldest tricks in the book.

1180
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danny, if you wouldn't mind opening up the box,

1181
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and showing everybody that it's completely empty.

1182
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we're gonna need 12 courageous volunteers.

1183
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1184
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and put her inside this mystery box.

1185
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are two pencils out there.

1186
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1187
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here! - Yeah!

1188
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, you will say the magic word.

1189
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abracadabra.

1190
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1191
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for no reason. And then...

1192
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fluffy has magically vanished before your very eyes.

1193
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1194
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're about to.

1195
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And sleep.

1196
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Down, down. Sleep, sleep. Completely sleep.

1197
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1198
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now we are gonna debunk

1199
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a few magic myths this evening.

1200
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all know that Fluffy is, in fact, alive and well.

1201
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1202
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As has the mirror

1203
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which makes the box only appear as though it's empty.

1204
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you hear the word "Freeze"

1205
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you are all football players.

1206
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your job is to tackle,

1207
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}dismantle,

1208
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}crush,

1209
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tear limb from limb,

1210
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the quarterback.

1211
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we've all heard of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1212
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But has anyone heard of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1213
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will know who the quarterback is.

1214
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will be the one saying that word.

1215
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze.

1216
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three, two, one...

1217
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hands in the middle. One, two, three...

1218
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill the quarterback!

1219
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get on back to your seats.

1220
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a feeling I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1221
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess you have lost some weight.

1222
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the intermission,

1223
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we asked you to write down your current bank balance,

1224
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and seal it in an envelope.

1225
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1226
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone take 'em out.

1227
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, everybody,

1228
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1229
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shout 'em out.

1230
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clement? Frannick?

1231
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! Up here! - Oh. Way up there.

1232
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1233
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's me!

1234
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1235
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Josepha Hickey?

1236
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's me!

1237
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Josepha, I want you to focus on your balance,

1238
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and count from one to 10 out loud.

1239
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three, four, five...

1240
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

1241
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the first digit 5?

1242
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1243
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:19,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it again. This time, faster.

1244
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three, four, five, six...

1245
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

1246
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six. Again.

1247
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:25,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two...

1248
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Josepha, is your bank balance $562 as of today?

1249
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:32,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. That's what I got.

1250
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1251
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Dina,

1252
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One,

1253
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four.

1254
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven.

1255
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Seven. - Yeah.

1256
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:49,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think it is. But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1257
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clement.

1258
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1259
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1260
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1261
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Focus on your number.

1262
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1263
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is strange.

1264
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I hate to say this, but you're all wrong.

1265
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every last one of you is dead wrong

1266
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about what you think is in your account.

1267
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you can sit down now.

1268
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I almost forgot.

1269
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This evening would not be possible

1270
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:34,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if it weren't for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1271
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big applause! Big applause!

1272
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Art, actually, why don't you come up on stage for the finale?

1273
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on down, Art! - Come on down, Art!

1274
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he goes. Okay, good.

1275
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we on red?

1276
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bright red. We're all standing by.

1277
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1278
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he goes.

1279
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1280
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1281
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Art, I took a guess.

1282
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}North of 140. Am I right?

1283
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's 140 million, by the way.

1284
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Merritt.

1285
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can he be right about his balance

1286
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and everyone else be wrong?

1287
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1288
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, take out your paper.

1289
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And using the flashlight under your seat,

1290
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}start to warm up that paper.

1291
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think your correct balance begins to appear.

1292
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Art, don't worry, we have a flashlight for you.

1293
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1294
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look.

1295
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on there, Daniel?

1296
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1297
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:50,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$144,579,651.

1298
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now...

1299
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it says $70,000 less.

1300
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Josepha, can you stand up?

1301
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1302
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, what is your new number?

1303
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:07,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$70,562 now in my account.

1304
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:13,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it possible that Josepha's balance went up

1305
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the exact amount that Art's went down?

1306
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1307
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}IS it?

1308
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. It is.

1309
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1310
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1311
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:33,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$281,477.

1312
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a confession to make.

1313
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's right. We lied about something.

1314
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1315
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of you have one thing in common.

1316
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone in this room was a victim

1317
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the hard times that

1318
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hit one of America's most treasured cities.

1319
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1320
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your businesses.

1321
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your loved ones.

1322
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But all of you were insured by the same company.

1323
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tressler Insurance.

1324
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were abandoned.

1325
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were loopholed,

1326
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out of your settlements.

1327
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all for show. Correct?

1328
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"All" Meaning we're doing

1329
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it onstage in front of a paying audience?

1330
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, yes, it's for show.

1331
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1332
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says it right here on my cell phone!

1333
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:23,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, look at your cell phones right now! Everybody!

1334
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this for real?

1335
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

1336
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this happening?

1337
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know! I can't tell!

01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could we, Art?

1340
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,920

01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd need access to information

1347
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You certainly would never tell us.

1348
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got confirmation. It's really happening. They robbed him.

1371
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1372
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I'll take this. Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1373
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's turning left on Burgundy.

1374

1385
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going in Napoleon House.

01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk about a fumble.

1405
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is quickly becoming a national story,

01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as The Horsemen have now seemingly pulled off the impossible

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but you... You let him go.

01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this wasn't about you.

1440
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:57,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please tell me why this was not about me.

1441
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1442
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Played out on a global scale.

1443
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:08,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1444
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The distraction, while they set up the real trick.

1445
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was a $140-million distraction?

1446
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:17,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1447
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that very ego that got

1448
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you involved with them in the first place

1449
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is what keeps you from seeing that.

1450
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know... -"I can destroy you."

1451
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I do know.

1452
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you won't.

1453
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you won't destroy them.

1454
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever this grand trick is,

1455
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it was designed a long time ago.

1456
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I believe that what's

1457
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about to follow is really going to amaze.

1458
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I suggest you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1459
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1460
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you stand to make

1461
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:58,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1462
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:59,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And destroy them.

1463
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stand to make five million.

1464
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I flinching?

1465
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:08,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're not.

1466
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry for your arm.

1467
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'm sorry.

1468
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1469
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm at a loss.

1470
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, when Merritt said i hardly spent any time away from the desk,

1471
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he was right.

1472
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:52,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1473
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:57,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what's this all about?

1474
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1475
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Eye are the keepers of real magic

1476
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the protectors of those who practice it.

1477
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Candidates for initiations

1478
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Must follow a series of commands with blind obedience."

1479
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This isn't real. - But there are some who think it is.

1480
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I?

1481
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:24,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to this, they only take new people twice a century.

1482
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what? The Horsemen are doing these shows

1483
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in order to get into this thing?

1484
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't know. - I don't know.

1485
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:34,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I guess these guys could just rob banks to rob banks.

1486
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:36,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't have to put on a show for that.

1487
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's probably just a myth.

1488
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it doesn't make any sense,

1489
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1490
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:45,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't say? - No.

1491
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:51,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe that some things are only discovered

1492
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you take certain leaps.

1493
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, I gotta get to... - Yeah. Yeah.

1494
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. Good night. - Yeah. Good night.

1495
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry. -It's all right.

1496
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If The Eye did exist,

1497
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:15,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'd have to assume they were watching us, right?

1498
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1499
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think someone is watching us, but it isn't magic.

1500
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your fears are correct.

1501
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not and has never been your phone.

1502
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:27,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1503
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bug.

1504
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:33,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone has heard every call, read every text.

1505
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how they were able to stay ahead of us.

1506
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:35,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn it!

1507
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1508
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1509
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Picture's up.

1510
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, fast forward.

1511
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on, go on. Freeze!

1512
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1513
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Play it through.

1514
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1515
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. That's where he took my phone.

1516
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that thing transmitting?

1517
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only when you're making a call or sending a text.

1518
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus I removed the bug.

1519
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Put it back in and turn on the phone.

1520
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't know that we know about the bug.

1521
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1522
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:10,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1523
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find my real phone and track it.

1524
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:16,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago, it's in New York City.

1525
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

1526
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1527
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got power? Cut it.

1528
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1529
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:25,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Squeeze 'em out.

1530
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want 'em to feel our presence.

1531
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And get me an airplane!

1532
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The firewall's down. Do they know about this?

1533
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They who?

1534
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"They," "Them," Whoever we're working for.

1535
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are we working for?

1536
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1537
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:40,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop being paranoid.

1538
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It really does happen.

1539
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It happened to you. Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1540
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, I don't know if I can do this, all right.

1541
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1542
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then don't screw up. You're always talking about

1543
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wanting to be treated like an adult.

1544
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now might be a good time to start acting like one.

1545
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1546
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what I'm doing here.

1547
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you would do anywhere else.

1548
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

1549
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. Then I'm gone.

1550
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can do whatever you want when this is over, Merritt.

1551
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But until then, you stick to the plan.

1552
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:20,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys. They're here.

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1556
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's Interpol. She's with me.

1557
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,060

01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay in the car.

1560
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1561

01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is my money being well-spent?

1567

1604
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't have tactical command.

1605
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't trust me, just tell me.

01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:32,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is not east. - North! North!

1620
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:34,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're heading north on the FDR Drive. - What?

1621
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,780

1643
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, man! Get out! - He's gonna die in here.

1644
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:28,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1645
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:30,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go! Leave him!

1646
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:36,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Paper! - Dylan!

01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, the unfolding story of

1649
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:08,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a popular and controversial group of magicians,

1650
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who have been fast capturing the public's imagination,

1651
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:13,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}took a dark turn when a police action that began in Chinatown

1652
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}developed into a dramatic,

1653
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}high-speed chase across the 59th Street Bridge,

1654
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which caused a fatal collision that took the life of Jack Wilder,

1655
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one of the so-called Four Horsemen.

1656
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:28,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whereabouts of the other three Horsemen remain unknown at this time.

1657
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan, they just figured out

1658
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:35,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what the paper was in Jack's car.

1659
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they know what it is?

1660
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1661
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1662
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1663
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1664
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

1665
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1666
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rhodes.

1667
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:50,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do understand the function

1668
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the magician's assistant, don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1669
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she's there to distract them

1670
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while he sets up the trick.

1671
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1672
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:01,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While you're watching the magician,

1673
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that lovely innocent is actually pulling the strings.

1674
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you find it peculiar that Interpol would send you

1675
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:11,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a first timer off the desk to be your assistant?

1676
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:14,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did she request to be put on the case?

1677
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was assigned to the case.

1678
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luck of the draw.

1679
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:22,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1680
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:26,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1681
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's in it for you?

1682
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just trying to even the game.

1683
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I'm playing with

1684
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:33,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}somebody wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1685
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1686
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a problem.

1687
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the safe.

1688
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Hey.

1689
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he doing here?

1690
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Giving us our first solid lead.

1691
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been investigating a private security contractor

1692
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}called Elkhorn

1693
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- For the last five years... - And?

1694
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've been hiding close to a half billion dollars...

1695
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1696
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:03,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The money's in a vault inside a warehouse in Queens.

1697
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We think this vault is your magicians' final target.

1698
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The magician who died on the bridge...

1699
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You pulled our classified

1700
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:12,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elkhorn file right from his crispy little hand.

1701
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,640


1702
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And despite their bullshit Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1703
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your magicians are nothing more than common thieves.

1704
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:18,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did they get the file?

1705
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the part you're gonna find

1706
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1707
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They patched to my server after they accessed

1708
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:27,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your mobile command center in New Orleans

1709
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:29,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with codes they got from your phone.

1710
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1711
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:36,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The level of incompetence displayed on this case,

1712
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1713
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,920


1714
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1715
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boss, he's taking over?

1716
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, gentlemen.

1717
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1718
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1719
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why the hell did you take this case? - What?

1720
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People say I'm "Hard to read." That's an American expression.

1721
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand it?

1722
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1723
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, then let me make myself perfectly clear to you.

1724
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:04,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I find out that you are anything other than

1725
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who you say you are, I swear...

1726
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we French also have an expression.

1727
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}La foi soulève la montagne.

1728
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Faith can move mountains."

1729
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1730
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then you need to have a little faith in me.

1731
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I've done nothing to deserve otherwise.

1732
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just got my ass headed to me.

1733
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:21,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am losing this case.

1734
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:24,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So faith is a luxury I don't have any time for right now.

1735
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:33,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More than anything in his life,

1736
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:38,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack wanted to be the most famous magician who ever lived.

1737
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:40,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't say he achieved it,

1738
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:44,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I do hope wherever he is, it is full of magic.

1739
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:48,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the point is... Sorry.

1740
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is...

1741
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point of why we are here

1742
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:56,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to say that we are not... We cannot quit now.

01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've started something bigger than all of us.

1744
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:00,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to finish it.

1745
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Approaching the warehouse.

1746
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Units 5 and 6 cover the north and south entrances.

1747
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are going for the vault.

1748
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:22,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1749
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:27,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

1750
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1751
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just moved it while you were outside.

1752
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Evans' orders. - What?

1753
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never said that.

1754
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, you got a phone call

1755
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1756
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:38,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never heard that come out of my mouth, Agent.

1757
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:39,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

1758
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:41,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell me what's going on,

1759
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:42,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because this is bullshit!

1760
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:43,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1761
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

1762
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1763
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1764
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the safe?

1765
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His team is loading the truck.

1766
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop the truck! - Stop!

1767
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:10,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop! - Hey! Stop that truck!

1768
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:20,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell's going on? We got our orders.

1769
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:22,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1770
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Here's what I want.

1771
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this moment, they think that safe's leaving this site.

1772
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we stay with it.

1773
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:34,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We follow it all the way to... Where's it going?

1774
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}5 Pointz. Up the street.

1775
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we go to 5 Pointz.

1776
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1777
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:40,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll lead us right to 'em.

1778
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two are with me.

1779
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys.

1780
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:59,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Office just called with this.

1781

1782
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point of why we're here is to say that we are not...

1783
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We cannot quit now.

1784
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:10,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've started something bigger than all of us.

1785
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:11,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to finish it.

1786
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:12,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember the name Jack Wilder

1787
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you see us live,

1788
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,550

1790
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's exactly where we're headed.

1791
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, boss. I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1792
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but these guys are kinda tricky.

1793
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1794
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz

1795
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as the renegade Horsemen

1796
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}taunt the FBI into a final showdown.

1797
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Horsemen have invited us to their final round

01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of their three-act face-off with the FBI.

1799
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do they have in store? We're about to find out.

1800
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All eyes on the truck. Let's see who approaches.

1801
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copy that.

1802
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1803
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, for us.

1804
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got movement. Someone's walking toward the truck.

1805
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a woman.

1806
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:26,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Freeze! - Oh, shit!

1807
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:29,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell's going on?

1808
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1809
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your guns down.

1810
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:37,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1811
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:38,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding?

1812
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm following them, just like you are.

1813
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:42,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not following anybody anymore.

1814
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1815
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1816
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your ass is mine.

1817
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:49,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are still idiots.

1818
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:51,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This happens to be the former

1819
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:56,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's where I did my first show.

1821
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if you wanna look like even bigger idiots,

1822
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why not open it?

1823
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1824
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would you mind reenacting your look

1825
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:06,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of absolute befuddlement for me?

1826
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1827
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:11,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the safe.

1828
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:13,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go ahead. - Open it.

1829
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:18,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell?

1830
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1831
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:23,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that.

1832
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1833

01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

1835
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:33,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back!

1836
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1837
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have you chasing empty safes again.

1838
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:51,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once again, misdirection.

1839
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The show is starting. Move out!

1840
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:02,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The question I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1841
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"What happened to the real one?"

1842
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clear! Clear 'em out!

1843
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Move 'em out. Move 'em out of the way.

1844
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:32,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}FBI! Give me a path!

1845
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clear out! Clear out!

1846
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is magic?

1847
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magic is deception.

1848
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But deception designed to delight,

1849
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to entertain, to inspire.

1850
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1851
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:45,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is about belief.

1852
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faith.

1853
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust.

1854
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without those qualities,

1855
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:56,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}magic, as an art form, would no longer exist.

1856
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what happens if these qualities

1857
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are not used for their higher purpose?

1858
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:04,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1859
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:06,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For personal gain or for greed.

1860
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it's no longer magic.

1861
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,870
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's crime.

1862
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tonight, for our final act,

1863
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're gonna help us set a few things right.

1864
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on here, Rhodes?

1865
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:22,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

1866
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Showtime.

1867
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look!

1868
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,390
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1869
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, go, go!

1870
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dylan! - FBI, coming through!

1871
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1872
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:44,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're going in the wrong direction

1873
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you know it.

1874
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1875
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:51,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to trust me. Take your leap of faith.

1876
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

1877
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to go with her.

1878
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:56,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1879
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead!

1880
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's on you, Fuller.

1881
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1882
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daniel?

1883
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:39,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As our, let's call it, year of living dangerously

1884
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}comes to a close, in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1885
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:45,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to express a sentiment

1886
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to you about our relationship.

1887
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:48,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1888
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,800
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, when I first met you, I thought you were kind of a

1889
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}dick.

1890
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

1891
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's it.

1892
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's very nice.

1893
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:04,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - I'm touched.

1894
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Just from the heart.

1895
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1896
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you!

1897
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God. What are we gonna do when this is over?

1898
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on our own.

1899
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our instructions run out after the show.

1900
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:20,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if there is no "Eye,"

1901
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:21,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we were completely played

1902
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we spend the next 20 years in jail, then,

1903
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:26,340
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to say that...

1904
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Me, too.

1905
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little too sentimental for me.

1906
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There they are!

1907
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1908
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:47,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab 'em!

1909
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up!

1910
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:54,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell?

1911
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

1912
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, New York!

1913
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for the magic.

1914
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:21,980
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And thank you for being such

1915
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}an incredible and dedicated audience.

1916
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:29,360
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, like all good things, it must come to an end.

1917
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:34,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we would like to start our show tonight...

1918
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,200
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By saying goodbye.

1919
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:40,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we wanted was to bring the world to a magic show.

1920
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And thereby bring a little magic back to the world.

1921
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:48,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clear the way!

1922
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has been one hell of a ride for all of us.

1923
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:04,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's time for us to disappear.

1924
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, New York.

1925
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,940
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And thank you for believing in us.

1926
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,730
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

1927
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze!

1928
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1929
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn it!

1930
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:07,040
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1931
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1932
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:14,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1933
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:18,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I guess this is it.

1934
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it?

1935
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan!

1936
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan! Dylan!

1937
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:56,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You see that? - What?

1938
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the real money?

1939
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:21,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1940
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,760


1941
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,920


1942
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,220


1943
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been framed.

1944
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure you were.

1945
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I can prove it.

1946
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:19,630
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always do.

1947
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1948
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:24,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1949
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1950
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:29,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fellas, can I have a few minutes with my friend here alone, please.

1951
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

1952
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1953
01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:40,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got information to trade.

1954
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,570
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1955
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's of some value.

1956
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:49,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These bars give a man time to think.

1957
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1958
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember the rabbit trick in the second show?

1959
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:59,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The box was never empty.

1960
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:02,590
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The room wasn't either.

1961
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:06,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After gaining access to the warehouse,

1962
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:08,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Horsemen left the real safe

1963
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and transformed the whole room

1964
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into a giant rabbit box.

1965
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:17,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go charging in there,

1966
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:20,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thinking the safe was already gone.

1967
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,780
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Stop!

1968
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:24,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Missing the trick. Again.

1969
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:25,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which was to make you think

1970
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:27,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the safe had already been stolen,

1971
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:29,620
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1972
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, while you were busy playing with balloon animals,

1973
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:35,960
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1974
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:55,640
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

1975
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Wilder.

1976
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

1977
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No way. He died right in front of my eyes.

1978
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless, of course, he didn't.

1979
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:14,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's locked.

1980
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weren't you listening?

1981
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's ever locked.

1982
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:22,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1983
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a big boy now, Jack.

1984
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:27,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1985
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Led you to the bridge.

1986
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:34,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the other Horsemen were waiting

1987
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:36,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with an identical replacement car.

1988
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:38,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It only took a split second

1989
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,230
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for you to lose contact with it and make the switch.

1990
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:05,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you crawled into that burning car,

1991
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,920
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}quite heroically, I might add,

1992
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you almost died trying to rescue

1993
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:14,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what I assume was a cadaver from the morgue.

1994
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:20,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why go through such an elaborate and dangerous plan

1995
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just to frame one guy?

1996
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:23,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

1997
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They never kept any of the money they took.

1998
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's the part I haven't been able to put together yet.

1999
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:28,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I just gave you

2000
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}information that is substantially more important.

2001
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,450
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. Not really. - What?

2002
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:37,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I finally got a chance to really look into Lionel Shrike.

2003
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:40,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His comeback attempt. His accident.

2004
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The insurer who denied the family's claim?

2005
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:46,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tressler Insurance.

2006
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bank that carried the note?

2007
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Credit Republican of Paris.

2008
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:54,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Credit Republicain de Paris.

2009
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:54,700


2010
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you make of that?

2011
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A sucker is born every minute.

2012
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:03,100
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if all this was just leading up to

2013
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,900
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}us getting mugged in Central Park at 2:00 A.M.?

2014
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:08,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm telling you, we're right where we need to be.

2015
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just have to find...

2016
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:11,070
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That?

2017
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:15,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Lionel Shrike tree.

2018
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the card encased in glass.

2019
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we do now?

2020
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:39,850
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, nice!

2021
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,160
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, here's my new theory.

2022
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:01,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

2023
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:02,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Waiting

2024
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:07,080
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the truly great magicians to distinguish themselves

2025
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,840
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from the mediocre ones.

2026
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:11,880
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe that was you.

2027
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deep down inside you wanted nothing more

2028
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,470
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than to be part of the "Eye", But you were never invited.

2029
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you try to destroy them. But instead what happens?

2030
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You pissed them off.

2031
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:27,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Eye isn't real.

2032
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,610
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, then, explain then. Who's behind all this?

2033
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,190
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody with an obsession.

2034
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Meticulous. - Who?

2035
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:37,280
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

2036
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody so prepared to lose

2037
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:42,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they wouldn't even be a suspect until the trick was done.

2038
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:45,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want a profile. I need a name. Who? Who?

2039
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know who.

2040
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:49,790
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they had to have access to the warehouse

2041
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to plant the mirrors.

2042
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:56,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

2043
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got past them not once, not twice, but consistently.

2044
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:02,680
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost as if they were on the...

2045
01:48:15,570 --> 01:48:16,950
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The inside.

2046
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You.

2047
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:35,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

2048
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:38,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the question, isn't it?

2049
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

2050
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:44,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell you how long I've waited

2051
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:46,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to see the look on your face.

2052
01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:50,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

2053
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:52,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want from me?

2054
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,110
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do I want?

2055
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to spend the rest of your life in this cell,

2056
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:02,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}staring at four walls and wondering how you missed it.

2057
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you let yourself be so blinded by your ego

2058
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:09,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you convinced yourself that you were one step ahead

2059
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:12,130
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you were always two steps behind.

2060
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan?

2061
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:19,970
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

2062
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:23,140
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan! How did this happen?

2063
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,480
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dylan!

2064
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

2065
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:35,320
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

2066
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,490
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

2067
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:44,370
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not see that coming.

2068
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:45,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's impossible!

2069
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:46,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way.

2070
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:49,330
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was actually pretty good.

2071
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:50,830
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

2072
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:53,460
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I said, "Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2073
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:54,580
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were in agreement.

2074
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,000
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Right.

2075
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:57,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henley.

2076
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:00,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen her speechless.

2077
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:01,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take that as a huge compliment.

2078
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:05,050
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man, I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

2079
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,350
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, listen, for the record,

2080
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:11,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have always been a 100% believer.

2081
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the amount of energy I have expended to keep

2082
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these infidels on point...

2083
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:17,770
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merritt, you're in.

2084
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:19,690
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God bless.

2085
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,820
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come.

2086
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:25,030
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The real magic is taking four strong solo acts

2087
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,120
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and making them all work together.

2088
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,660
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's exactly what you did.

2089
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:31,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So welcome.

2090
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,090
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the Eye.

2091
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:38,860


2092
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:44,300


2093
01:51:44,150 --> 01:51:45,410
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was all connected.

2094
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:49,990
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

2095
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:56,260
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bonjour.

2096
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,670
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Elkhorn?

2097
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:02,710
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the connection to Shrike?

2098
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:08,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2099
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,890
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They used cheap steel.

2100
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:13,760
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They cut corners.

2101
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:17,060
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he got to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

2102
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:18,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he was trapped.

2103
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:21,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was your father.

2104
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,860
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The morning before the show didn't feel like any other day.

2105
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:30,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When my father said he had to go to work,

2106
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:32,910
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he could see that I didn't want him to leave.

2107
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he gave me his watch,

2108
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:40,290
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he told me to count the seconds until he came back.

2109
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:44,170
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have never let his watch stop since then.

2110
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,380
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And from that moment on,

2111
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,010
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I created a persona.

2112
01:52:49,630 --> 01:52:51,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I planned. I worked out every detail.

2113
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,930
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the one thing that I couldn't imagine happening

2114
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:56,520
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was you.

2115
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:01,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know that the logical conclusion for you

2116
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:04,400
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to take this case to its resolution.

2117
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,530
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And for you to turn me in.

2118
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:13,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

2119
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:19,500
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know how I feel about resolution and logic.

2120
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:22,210
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you also know

2121
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:27,420
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I think some things are best left unexplained.

2122
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:35,720
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more secret to lock away.

2123
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:55,720

2125
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:06,540
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Closer.

2126

{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because now you know our secret.

2127
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could be anywhere. Watching you.

2128
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,550
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're looking for someone to help us with our next trick.

2129
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,180
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the count of three, open your eyes

2130
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:20,220
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tell me what you see.

2131
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,310
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One.

2132
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two...

2133
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,150
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, stop, stop, stop.

2134
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:59,600
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, stop the van. Stop the van.

2135
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:01,240
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2136
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,700
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank God.

2137
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:07,750
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we?

2138
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:10,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great, another shit hole.

2139
01:56:10,330 --> 01:56:12,250
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, feeling it.

2140
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:16,510
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2141
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:19,430
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out this place.

2142
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:22,300
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where'd you bring us? - Was there no landfill where we were?

2143
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:24,270
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is awesome.

2144
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:26,810
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this our new gear?

2145
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:28,440
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There'd better not be, like, matching jumpsuits in there.

2146
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:29,560
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I don't wear spandex.

2147
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:32,020
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's locked. - Guys, the cards.

2148
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,650
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What card? - What do you mean, "What card"?

2149
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,740
{\fnCAMbria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.
