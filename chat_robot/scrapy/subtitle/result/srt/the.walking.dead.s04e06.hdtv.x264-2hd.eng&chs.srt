00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,131
我们是一个社区

4
00:00:06,277 --> 00:00:08,565
那是我妻子 我女儿和我本人

10
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,707
把他斩草除根
We should finish him.

11
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:25,009
你干什么!?
What the hell are you doing!?

12
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:26,760
- 这不值得  - 那是大屠杀
- It's not worth it.  - That was a slaughter.

13
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:13,200
我已经漂泊了好几个月了

15
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,233
是啊
Yeah.

16
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:22,133
你之前住哪儿啊?

00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,400
一个小镇上
I was in a town.

18
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,034
那儿有行尸吗?
Were the monsters there?

19
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,901
没有
No.

20
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,034
很安全
It was safe.

21

大家都很友善
Full of good people.

22
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,534
发生了什么事?
What happened?

23
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:42,467
他失控了
He just lost it.

24
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,968
谁?
Who?

The man in charge.

26

31
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:28,133
- Tara  - 我的意思是...
- Tara.  - I mean...

32
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,034
我们神经绷得太紧了
We're a little on edge.

33
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:32,767
我们一直困在这里 等国民警卫队救援...
We've been holed up in here waiting for the National Guard since...

34
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,534
- 自灾难临头以来  - 怎么说话呢
- The shit hit the fan.  - Language.

35
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,500
自他妈的灾难临头以来
Since the crap hit the fan.

36
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,001
可是国民警卫队
Which it did

37
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,601
却抛弃了我们
right before it got flung all over the damn place.

38
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,500
你打算待在这里吗?
Are you planning on staying in the building?

39
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,100
到底要不要留下?
Are you planning on staying or not?

40
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,400
- 该死的 你是哑巴啊   - Tara
- Holy shit, with the no talking.  - Tara.

41
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,467
我姐姐在问你话
My sister asked you a question.

42
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,467
只呆一晚
Just for the night.

43
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,567
看见了吗?
You see this?

44
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:11,767
这是一把装满子弹的标配史密斯&维森手枪
This here is a fully loaded, standard issue Smith & Wesson.

46

47
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,601
每天杀你一次
every day for the next 10 years.

48
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,534
你要是敢胡来
You mess with me or my family,

49
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,834
我发誓 我会杀了你
and I swear to Christ, I will put you down.

50
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:27,001
明白?
Got it?

51
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:29,068
明白
Got it.

52
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,267
那就没事了
Then we're cool.

53
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,534
碰碰拳头
Pound it.

54
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,601
给你

55

56
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,100
对

61
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,367
找不到别的食物了
You're not gonna find anything better in there.

62

Tara把房间都翻了个底朝天了
Tara ransacked the place

63
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,267
Wilhelm小姐也动身去佛罗里达了
after Miss Wilhelm took off for Florida.

64
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:51,734
Wilhelm小姐很喜欢吃棉豆

65
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:07,034

Come on, kiddo. Show me what you got here.

68
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,434
一切都好吗?
Everything okay?

69
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,734
她又没吃饭
She didn't eat again.

70
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,334
她喜欢腌牛肉 试试那个

71
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,034
最后两罐是为爸爸留的
I'm saving the last two cans for Dad.

72
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:09,034
她不是挑剔 只是太害怕了 
She's not picky, she's terrified.

73
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:11,034
嘘
Shh.

74
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,233
别乱动
Why don't you slow down, buddy, all right?

75
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,634
这里可不是假日酒店
This ain't the Holiday Inn.

76
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,467
左边的水桶是用来洗漱的

77

78
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,701
Tara啊
Tara.

79
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,801
哦
Oh.

80
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,701
对不起
Sorry.

81
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,233
吃饱了吗?
You get enough to eat?

82
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:55,068
我给你泡杯咖啡
I'll get you some coffee.

83
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,867
坐吧
Sit down.

84
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,667
坐那儿 去吧
Right there. Go on.

85
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,968
该你了 走吧
Go ahead, roll again.

86
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,968
嘿 伙计
Hey, come here.

87
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,200
有烟吗?
You got a cigarette?

88
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,968
爸爸 你的氧气罐
Dad, your oxygen tank.

89
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,534
看不见红色标签上写的什么?
Do you not see that red sticker?

90
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:26,068
如果因为一支烟炸了这个房间 我会遭天谴的
I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra Menthol is gonna blow this place up

91
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,667
毕竟千辛万苦都是为了活下去 对吗?
after all the work we've done to stay alive up here. Okay?

92
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,667
都一样的 Lily
It's all the same, Lily.

93
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,001
你能不唠叨吗
You can stop that talk right there.

94
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,200
只不过一支烟罢了
It's just a cigarette.

95
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:39,034
自便
Help yourself.

96
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,467
我们吃巧克力棒好几天了
We got roni sticks for days.

97
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,601
或许都好几年了
Years, probably.

98
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,100
看见那辆停在外面的卡车了吗?
You see that big truck parked outside?

99
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,233
拜托 伙计 那辆可爱的食品卡车
Come on, dude, the Gorbelli food truck.

100
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,367
Ray Charles本来能发现的
Ray Charles could have seen it.

101
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,867
是啊
Yeah.

102
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,934
爸爸给他们开车
Dad drove for them.

103
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,734
有时候还戴着氧气瓶呢
Even with the tank.

104
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,467
人们关了75号公路那天...
The day they closed down the 75...

105
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,001
就是大难临头那天
When the S-H-I-T hit the fan.

106
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:06,233
他去学校接了Megan 又从医院接了我...
He grabbed Megan from school, picked me up at the hospital...

107
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:09,034
她从垃圾堆里淘出了好多氧气罐
She stole a bunch of oxygen tanks from that dump.

108
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,133
然后我们三个人就冲过去找Tara
Then the three of us rushed over to get Tara.

109
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,068
当时我正在局里上班
I was at the station working, booking.

110
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,034
当一切发生的时候
With everything going on,

111
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:24,133
僵尸入侵攻击 军队攻入亚特兰大
the attacks, the Army going into Atlanta,

112
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,634
他坚决不允许大家离开他的视线
he wasn't about to let us out of his sight.

113
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:29,100
我们很幸运 那个老男人的卡车
Lucky for us, the old man's truck was pretty much stocked

114
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,834
从上到下
floor to ceiling with sketti rings,

115
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,601
被各种零食小吃几乎塞满了
turkey chili, and these little suckers.

116
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:38,767
Meg 爷爷休息下 行吗?
Meg, Granddad needs a break, okay?

117
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,267
- Lily  - 没问题 爸爸
- Lily.  - Sure, Daddy.

118
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,934
我数到三
On three.

119
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,601
过来搭把手啊 大块头
A little help here, big guy.

120
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,267
这里
Here.

121
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,367
哦 对 不 不是说你
Oh, right. No, not you.

122
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,167
这屋里的另一个人
The other big guy in the room.

123
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,100
Tara啊
Tara.

124
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,267
好的
Okay.

125
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,867
我数三声
On three.

126
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,334
好了 一 二...
Okay, one, two...

127
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,300
这里 这里
Here. Here.

128
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:27,167
嘿 你听见了吗?
Hey. You hear them?

129
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,934
嗯
Yeah.

130
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,400
嗯
Yeah.

131
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
帮我抬下腿 伙计?
Get my legs, friend?

132
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,167
Tara上去过好几次
Tara's been up there a bunch of times

133
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,467
把那帮混蛋杀个片甲不留
blasting them bastards to pieces.

134
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:45,400
她说它们不断回来
She says they just keep getting back up.

135
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,601
我告诉她别再去杀了
I told her no more.

136
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:51,233
别再浪费她的弹药
Can't afford to waste her bullets.

137
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,801
你有孩子吗?
You got kids?

138
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:01,367
没有
No.

139
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,667
我女儿们出生的时候
When my girls were born,

140
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:07,034
我才真正懂得一个男人的职责
that's when I finally figured out what it was to be a man.

141
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,300
你懂的 一个真正的男人
You know, a real man.

142
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,434
你要保护她们 保证她们的安全
You protect them, you keep them safe.

143
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,068
你要让她们更坚强
You just try to make them stronger

144
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,734
直到她们有能力自己去闯荡
until they can look out for themselves.

145
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:20,434
但是在这儿
But this here,

146
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,534
我... 我从来都没指望
I... I never counted on this.

147
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,434
嘿 我有个伙计
Hey, I got a buddy.

148
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,667
Bill Jenkins 他住在楼上的303
Bill Jenkins, he lives up in 303.

149
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:34,133
他有一套超级酷的西洋双陆棋
He's got a real nice backgammon set up there.

150
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,434
他却不稀罕 把它扔在床低下
He won't mind and he keeps it under his bed there.

151
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:39,901
只是... 拜托
Just... please.

152
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,667
你熟悉外面的环境
You've been out there in the world

153
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:45,200
你知道怎么保护自己
and you know how to handle yourself around those things.

154
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,233
听着 我知道你或许不明白
Look, I know you might not understand it

155
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,267
因为你没有女儿
cause you don't got a baby girl of your own,

156
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,100
但是...
but... 

157
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
那套双陆棋或许能让我的Megan张口说话
it might be something that might make my Megan talk again.

158
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,867
拜托了
Please.

159

客气了
You're welcome.

161
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,433
一些路上或许能用到的东西
Couple things for the road.

162
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,034
我不需要
I'm okay.

163
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:51,268
你帮助了我们

我们得感谢你

你就接受吧
Deal with it.

166
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,834
我想你需要这把枪
I guess you'll be needing this back.

167
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,834
你留着吧
Keep it.

168
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,600
别...
Don't...

169
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,667
扔给我
throw that at me.

170
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,867
这是你的枪 拿回去吧
It's your gun. You can have it back.

171
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,667
你需要一只
You need another one.

172
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,201
我有这个
I have this.

173
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,567
Tara说得对
Tara was right.

174
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,168
我们该搜你的身
We should have frisked you.

175
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,867
我从楼上找到的
I found it upstairs.

176
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,534
你留着那把
You keep that.

177
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:43,467
一定要击中脑袋
You have to kill the brain.

178
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,034
什么?
What?

179
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,867
你妹妹 她总是打四肢
Your sister, she shot 'em in the body,

180
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,600
但是只有击中脑袋
but you have to hit 'em here.

181
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,034
才能杀死他们
That's what kills them.

182
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:54,367
为什么?
Why?

183
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,734
我得问你件事
I need to ask you something.

184
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:08,234
我爸爸肺癌肺癌晚期
My dad's got stage four lung cancer.

185
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,734
我学过几年肿瘤学
I worked oncology for a few years.

186
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,534
他已经到了弥留之际了
He's nearing the end.

187
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:19,234
但是只有两天的氧气量了
He's got about two days of oxygen.

188
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,734
或许都不到两天
Maybe less.

189
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,168
我们都没想到他能撑这么久
We never thought he'd make it this long.

190
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:28,700
你已经为我们做了这么多 但是...
You've already done so much for us, but...

191
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
离这里几个街区
there's an old folks home

192
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,600
有一个老朋友的家里
a couple of blocks from here.

193
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,801
只要一罐就够了
Even one tank would mean everything.

194
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:41,700
他是唯一能让Megan露出笑容的人
He's the only one who can put a smile on Megan's face.

195
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,367
哪怕只是几秒钟
Even for a second.

196
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,001
- 都是没拆封的  - 你还好么?
- They're both full.  - Are you okay?

197
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,500
嗯
Yeah.

198
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,334
你都没给我机会说谢谢
You didn't let me say thank you.

199
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,567
嗯 我没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

200
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,267
坐下来
Sit.

201
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,134
让我重拾旧业吧
Let me be a nurse again.

202
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,234
好消息是伤口看起来不用缝合
Good news is it doesn't look like you need any stitches.

203
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,134
坏消息是...
Bad news...

204
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,434
会像被凶狠的蜜蜂蜇了一样疼
this is gonna sting like a couple of angry bees.

205
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:17,001
有事可做的感觉真好
Feels good to have something to do.

206
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:20,767
没人提到过世界末日有多无聊
Nobody ever mentioned just how boring the end of the world was gonna be.

207
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:48,334
她以为你是她爸爸
She thought you were her dad.

208
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,834
Megan以为
Megan.

209
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,734
就在她看见你在马路上时
When she saw you out there on the street.

210
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:59,267
三年半前的一晚 
He went out one night about three and a half years ago

211
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,700
他出门去买啤酒和彩票

212
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,734
说是马上就回来
Said he'd be right back.

213
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,934
Megan以为你是他爸爸
Megan thought you were him,

214
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,301
终于回家了
finally coming right back.

215
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,334
- 妈妈  - 我在屋里 宝贝

216
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,301
没事的 宝贝

217
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:28,767
Brian有个小伤口需要清洗消毒
Brian just got a boo-boo that needs a little cleaning up.

218
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:30,734
就像你碰伤时一样
Same as when you get a cut.

219

没有药膏了
I don't have the ointment.

220
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,368
在我回来前替我照看下病人好吗?
Why don't you watch my patient until I get back?

221
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,034
好的
Okay.

222
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,633
你眼睛怎么了?
What happened to your eye?

223
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:05,167
没了
It's gone.

224
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:08,967
是意外事故
Something happen to you

225
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,767
还是你天生就这样?
or were you just born like that?

226
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,600
是意外事故
Something happened to me.

227
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,067
这样问会不会不好?
Was that bad to ask?

228
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:25,034
没关系
No.

229
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:32,167
我可以告诉你我眼睛是怎么弄的
I'll tell you what happened to my eye,

230
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,401
但你要保证将它保密
but you have to promise to keep it secret.

231
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,301
我保证
I promise.

232
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,667
这是什么意思?
What's that?

233
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,167
拉钩钩啊
Pinkie swear.

234

外加发毒誓 泄密就会死掉
Plus cross my heart and hope to die.

235
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,700
那好...
Well...

236
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,234
我是个海盗
I'm a pirate.

237
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,134
不可能
No way.

238
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,600
呀 被你识破了
Yeah, you caught me.

239
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:21,234
真正的原因是在我帮助别人时发生了意外
What really happened was I was trying to help someone.

240
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,101
一个我非常爱的人
Someone I loved very much.

241
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,401
你是怎么帮他们的?
How were you trying to help them?

242
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,301
我是在保护他们 知道吗?
I was trying to protect them, you know?

243
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:35,134
让他们免受伤害
Stop them getting hurt.

244
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:37,001
但你自己却受伤了
But you got hurt instead.

245
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,834
是啊
Yeah.

246
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:43,468
他们也受伤了吗?
Did they get hurt, too?

247
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,633
呃...
Uh...

248
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,567
是啊 他们也受伤了
Yeah, yeah, they did.

249

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
我也觉得
Me, too.

251
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,934
这是什么
What is it?

252
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,600
象棋
Chess.

253
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,434
看起来真难
Looks hard.

254
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:12,834
对有些人来说可能很难 但你很聪明
Well, maybe for some folks, but you're smart.

255
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,367
很快就能学会
You'll catch on quick.

256
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,167
这个叫什么?
What's this one called?

257
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,367
卒
That's a pawn.

258
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,733
他们是你的士兵
They're your soldiers.

259
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:24,468
他们会死吗?
Do they die?

260
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:26,667
有时候会
Sometimes.

261
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,067
他们死掉你就会输吗?
Do you lose if they die?

262
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,301
不 不一定
No, not necessarily.

263
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:33,967
你可以牺牲很多士兵
You can lose a lot of soldiers,

264
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:36,434
但仍能赢得比赛
but still win the game.

265
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:42,667
这是国王
That's the king.

266
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:46,568
是你要抓住的人
That's the guy you want to capture.

267
00:29:56,568 --> 00:29:58,967
- 你在干什么?  - 马上就知道了
- What are you doing?  - You'll see.

268
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,600
这样很像你
Looks like you.

269
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:13,800
是啊
Yeah.

270
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,468
来 咱们开玩吧
Come on, let's play.

271
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,900
白色是你的棋
So these ones are pawns.

272
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,000

273
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,167
他死了
He's gone.

274
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:28,534
他死了有一会儿了
I think he's been gone a while.

275
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:35,167
你们都应该马上出去
Y'all should go now.

276
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,434
再给我们点时间
Just give us a minute.

277
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:41,733
我爱你 爸爸
I love you, Daddy.

278
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,700
Tara啊!
Tara!

279
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:54,267
- 住手! 你在干什么?  - 那已经不是爸爸了!
- Stop! What are you doing?  - It's not Dad!

280
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:55,667
- 住手!  - 那不是爸爸了!
- Stop!  - It's not Dad!

281
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:20,000
我是知道的
I know, okay?

282
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,967
不管怎样都会变成行尸吗?
It happens no matter what?

283
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,600
是的
Yeah.

284
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:28,167
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

285
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,967
他可能会抓住我
He could have got me.

286
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,633
他差点就咬到我
He almost got me.

287
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:43,000
我在想
I was thinking

288
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,067
他会感激你的
he would have been grateful or whatever

289
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,967
是你阻止了他的袭击...
that you stopped him, from him...

290
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,267
你明白我的意思吧?
You know what I mean?

291
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,834
所以 我不跟你计较了
So, yeah, we're cool.

292
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,934
我走了
Good-bye.

293
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:39,934
不
No.

294
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,733
- 我们跟你走  - 不行
- We're coming with you.  - No.

295
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:43,234
必须要找个更安全的地方
There has to be someplace better,

296
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:44,733
你来帮我们找
and you're gonna help us find it.

297
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,434
- Lily  - 我看到照片了 Brian

我知道你有过家庭

299
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:52,067
虽然我们不是你的家人
And I know we're not them.

300
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,067
但现在 我们就是你的家庭负担
But for now, you're stuck with us.

301
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,967
- 以后也将是这样  - 我做不到
- And that's just the way it's gonna be.  - I can't.

302
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,434
你已经在做了
You already have.

303
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,334
我们要往哪走?
Where should we go?

304
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,501
做计划也没用
No use making a plan.

305
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,367
要看他们能让我们去哪
We'll go where they let us.

306
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,501
他们是谁?
Who's they?

307
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,767
公路
The roads.

308
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,633
还有行尸
The biters.

309
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,934
我不算是个警察
I'm not really a cop.

310
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,800
也不完全是假的
I mean, it's not a total lie.

311
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,334
我进过警官学院
I was in the Academy.

312
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:34,267
抱歉对你说谎了
I'm sorry I lied to you.

313
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:39,301
无需抱歉
You don't have to be sorry.

314
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,367
还是很抱歉
Well, I am.

315
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,867
你觉得我们能找到地方吗?
Do you think we can make it?

316
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,201
我们会找到的
We'll make it.

317
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,201
你在说谎吗?
Are you lying to me?

318
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,334
没有
No.

319
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,301
到我们这里来啊 Megan
You can come join us, Megan.

320
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,201
她还需要时间去接受
It's just gonna take some time.

321
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:36,468
没关系的
It's okay.

322
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,600
很快就会找到其他的车
We'll find another car soon.

323
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,468
但愿你说的对
I hope you're right.

324
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:19,301
这些场面让我想起Sam
This whole country backdrop is reminding me of Sam.

325
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:22,334
- 又来了  - 我还以为她就是我的另一半
- Here we go.  - I thought she was the one.

326
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:25,067
你们只是一起去露营 吃蘑菇 仅此而已
Then you went camping, ate mushrooms, game over.

327
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:28,301
你忘记Sam崩溃掉 告诉我她有男朋友
You're forgetting the part where Sam broke down and told me she had a boyfriend,

328
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:29,967
她对女人不感兴趣
that she wasn't really into chicks.

329
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,667
啊 真是这辈子最烂的周末
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.
