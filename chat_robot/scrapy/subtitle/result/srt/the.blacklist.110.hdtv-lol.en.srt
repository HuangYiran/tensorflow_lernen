1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,730
Previously on The Blacklist...

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,890
We have credible intelligence
that you're being targeted.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,310
Anslo Garrick got you to bring me here

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,780
so that he could attack this facility.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,890
You're going into the box
until the threat is neutralized.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,440
Neutralized? Harold,
do not make a stand.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,700
He means to take me, Agent Ressler,

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,720
and kill anyone in
his way or in his wake.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,470
Hello, Red.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,160
- Where is everyone?
- Captured.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,000
I think Ressler's in bad shape.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,130
We're gonna go find those jammers.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,280
10 seconds, Red.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,510
Wait.

15
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,260
Red, I don't have to explain
what happens now, do I?

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,430
You open the box, or Dembe dies.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,650
Come on.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,780
{\a6}system reboot complete

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,130
Yes.

20
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,870
North Arlington Furniture
Warehouse. Can I help you?

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,740
Hatchling 5591.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,910
Stay on your knees.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,420
I got the signal out, but
I need a dispatch co...

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,160
Dispatch code...

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,160
Cavalry's on their way.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,940
You're about to get your ass
kicked off the planet, pal.

27
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,040
Want to bet I can drop you before you
can get one shot off with that pistol?

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,310
Well, I'm gonna kill
him now, aren't I, Red?

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,400
Open the box!

30
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,880
Go!

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,390
I killed him.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,820
We need to move... now!

33
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,520
Aram! Listen to me...
We need to move now!

34
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,090
Hold it!

35
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,760
Well, who might this be?
Someone you know, Red?

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,670
Please. Shh.

37
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,560
Ressler!

38
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,080
- Aah! Son of a bitch!
- Look at me.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,420
I need you to focus. I need the code.

40
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,870
- What code? What code?
- To open the box.

41
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,210
- Oh, God, my leg...
- Tell me the code now.

42
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,530
Do not give him the code,
Agent Ressler! That's an order!

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,260
Oh, come on!

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,940
Telecom has been restored.
They have an open signal out.

45
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,990
In about five minutes, an FBI
assault will retake the building.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,490
Get out now. You might survive.

47
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,780
- Lizzy. Hey, what's going on?
- Lizzy isn't available right now.

48
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,280
May I ask who's calling?

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,010
This is her husband.
Who the hell is this?

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm the guy that's gonna put
a bullet in your wife's head.

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,050
Hi.

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,350
Who is this?

53
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,520
- Put my wife on the phone.
- It's for you.

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,980
- Tom!
- Liz, are you okay? What's going on?

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,650
- Are you safe?
- Tom, listen to me! Call the FBI!

56
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,120
No! No, no.

57
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,900
What are you gonna
do? You gonna kill me?

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,030
You just saved my life.

59
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,020
Circumstances have changed, Donald.

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,530
If you can't save her,
you're of no use whatsoever.

61
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,530
Look at me. Look at me!

62
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,350
Agent Keen will die. Now is the time.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,340
Romeo. The access code is Romeo.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,040
R-O-M-E-O...
Romeo.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,330
Anslo, what are you doing here?

66
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,940

{\a6}****

69
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,070
Let them go, Anslo.

70
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,940
Are you pleading for
the lives of the feds?

71
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,760
There's enough blood on the floor.
It's time to get the hell out of here.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,660
Oh, I know what time it is.

73
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,830
You watch out for Old Red here.

74
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,130
He may not look like much,

75
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,880
but I once saw him kill a
Somali with a wire hanger.

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Simpler days, Anslo.

77
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,020
Simpler days. Right.

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,920
Bring her.

79
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,120
She doesn't do anything for
you, Anslo. She's dead weight.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,440
Do I look like I care what you say, Red?

81
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,710
Everyone get down now.

82
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,520
Coward.

83
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,520
Knees.

84
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,700
Secure the area and
contact headquarters!

85
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,560
Don't move. We're getting help.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

86
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,010
I need a phone!

87
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,400
I have to admit, Red, I was starting to
think you'd never come out of the box.

88
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,800
But then her. She was unexpected.

89
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,910
Old boy's still got the touch, does he?

90
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,150
Well, whatever blows up your skirt.

91
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,720
Hold on tight.

92
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,100
Red.

93
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,210
Breach team 5! Identify yourself!

94
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,090
I'm Assistant Director Harold Cooper!

95
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,540
Help these people get to the Washington
Hospital Center's trauma unit.

96
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,010
{\a6}District ****

97
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,690
90 seconds to the
drop. I need that chip!

98
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,210
The emissary hotel in
Chicago... Mr. Kaplan.

99
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,540
Hurry the hell up!

100
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,100
FBI! Follow that ambulance! Drive! Now!

101
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,130
Give me your phone! Give it to me!

102
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,150
- Hello?
- Aram!

103
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,580
Agent Keen, are you okay?

104
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,300
Sir! Are you... Are
you with Mr. Reddington?

105
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,570
I'm in pursuit, but I've lost visual!

106
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,340
I'm headed west on Constitution.

107
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,660
Do you have a location?
They're trying to pull his chip.

108
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,810
Hurry the hell up!
Close to the drop point!

109
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,690
- 30 seconds!
- I'm trying!

110
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,860
Just give me the bloody chip! Come on!

111
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,430
Aram, where are they?

112
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,720
Okay, six blocks west. Turn
right at the intersection.

113
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Turn right! Right here! Right here!

114
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,070
15 seconds. 2 blocks.

115
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,450
Get me that damned chip!

116
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,970
Okay, you're close. He
just turned south on 7th.

117
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,210
Okay, the signal has stopped moving.

118
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,210
He's right there. He's in the street.

119
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,950
Yeah, this is the right location.

120
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,320
Dispatch, we've got nothing.

121
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,710
Agent Keen, did you find him?

122
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,710
No, he's gone.

123
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,520
We lost Reddington.

124
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,710
Oh, this shall be fun.

125
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,530
How did this happen?

126
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,170
Anslo Garrick was a known
associate of Reddington's.

127
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,770
He came in with a tactical assault
team. He knew the floor plan.

128
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,980
Then I have no choice. This
task force is decommissioned.

129
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,810
- Diane...
- Do you understand what has happened, Harold?

130
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,370
You obviously have a mole.

131
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,370
We have to find Reddington.

132
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,470
The only thing that matters right
now is how quickly we contain this.

133
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,730
This did not happen.

134
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,750
Reddington is, and always
has been, a fugitive at large.

135
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,030
Aram, wait. You can't...

136
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,890
We're done. I'm done.

137
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,440
Listen to me... Red's alive.

138
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,190
Liz, this is out of my hands.

139
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,070
Okay, assuming... I could help...

140
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,940
- what would you need? - Closed-circuit
feeds from the block around the building

141
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,750
from when Reddington came
in, going back an hour.

142
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,990
Supposed to hand off the security
feeds to the new team of investigators.

143
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,120
I suppose I could make us a copy.

144
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,280
Thank you.

145
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,870
How do you think Ressler's doing?

146
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,870
He's in surgery.

147
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,050
They're hoping they can save his leg.

148
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,630
Aram...

149
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,420
we got to keep this between us.

150
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,940
We don't know who we can trust.

151
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,750
Yeah.

152
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,250
Emissary Hotel. How
may I direct your call?

153
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,530
Yes. Hi. Mr. Kaplan, please.

154
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,830
He's not available. Can you
be reached at this number?

155
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,980
This...

156
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,090
Uh, yes, I suppose.

157
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,310
Goodbye.

158
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,660
The girl.

159
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,330
The agent.

160
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,200
I want to know who she is.

161
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,670
You came out of the box for her.

162
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,960
Traded your life for hers.

163
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,410
Red Reddington placing somebody
else's life ahead his own.

164
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,300
What makes her so special?

165
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,910
I learned so much watching you, Red.

166
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,080
You taught me...

167
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,700
Gave me a taste of the good life.

168
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,250
But that's all I was allowed... A taste.

169
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,670
You're greedy, Anslo.

170
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,240
You went behind my back, made
deals you knew I wouldn't approve.

171
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,010
What did you expect?

172
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,040
I suppose I expected something
better than a bullet in the face, Red.

173
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,130
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I...

174
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,290
- I didn't know what was happening.
- I know.

175
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,320
- Who... Who... Who was that man on the phone?
- It's nothing.

176
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,070
- What happened to your face?
- I'm okay.

177
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,320
Damn it, you need to
stop. You need to stop.

178
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,230
You need to walk away from
this job before it destroys you.

179
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,280
{\a6}****

180
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,450
Don't. Listen to me.

181
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,520
Don't answer it. All right?

182
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Look at me. We can go.

183
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,160
- Go?
- Anywhere.

184
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,530
Nebraska. We talked about moving
there someday, at your dad's funeral.

185
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,970
Someday.

186
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,340
I got caught up in the
middle of something.

187
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,920
I have to take this.

188
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,000
Aram, what do you have for me?

189
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,540
I sent you the files.

190
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,670
Our cameras cover five blocks
around the office in every direction.

191
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,340
Okay, I'll look through them right now.

192
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,730
Don't bother. Red wasn't followed.

193
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,870
He came in at 5:15. No tail
cars, no eyes on the street.

194
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,970
Damn it.

195
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,700
How did Garrick know he
was in the post office?

196
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
My question exactly.

197
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,570
So I started thinking...

198
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,160
What if somebody inside
already tipped him off?

199
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,540
- You found the mole?
- No.

200
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,830
But I think I have a lead.

201
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,830
We routinely collect
all cellular transmission

202
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,990
from inside and directly
around this facility.

203
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,790
So much data... I had to play around
with various mathematical structures...

204
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,300
knots, multivariate polynomials...

205
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,240
- Aram, the lead?
- Right.

206
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,540
I found a pattern in
the transmissions...

207
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,520
a series of calls made
from a burner cell.

208
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,980
Each call was placed just seconds

209
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,050
after Reddington arrived
at the post office.

210
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,940
- All from the same burner?
- No. All from different burners,

211
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,890
but all the calls were
to the same number.

212
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,770
I vectored the address to a private
residence a few miles from here.

213
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,420
The address is 8123 12th street.

214
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,860
What?

215
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,110
I'll call you right back.

216
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,490
As with everything involving you,

217
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,230
things are more complicated
than they may appear.

218
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,110
If I could, I'd end this right now...

219
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,860
Give you the horrifying
death that you so deserve.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,340
Then do it.

221
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,820
Mm. When it's time.

222
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,320
You see, sadly, this
isn't my surprise party.

223
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,620
I am merely the hired help.

224
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,590
My job was to get you to the venue.

225
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,930
And while I would pay a high
price to silence you forever,

226
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:00,520
others have paid much more for the
chance to hear what you have to say.

227
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,800
Please.

228
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,920
Anesthesia blocks the
impulses to the brain

229
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,360
so one doesn't feel
the sensation of pain.

230
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,680
The drug that the kind doctor
is giving you does the opposite.

231
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,760
It enhances the impulses
received by the brain.

232
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,590
When he's finished, the feeling of
a breeze wafting against your skin

233
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,850
will be enough to make
you beg me to kill you.

234
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,340
Cooper.

235
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,910
{\a6}AD cooper

236
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,920
Agent Keen? Agent Keen, are you there?

237
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,030
Mr. Kaplan?

238
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,870
What color is the sky?

239
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,120
Red.

240
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,730
You?

241
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,630
You're Mr. Kaplan?

242
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,290
- Who else knows you're here?
- Nobody.

243
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,430
- Have you phoned anyone?
- No.

244
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,710
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

245
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,650
Every time Reddington
came to the post office,

246
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,720
a call was made to this
address... I assume to him.

247
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,760
He's been watching.

248
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,440
When he got word that Red
was at the post office,

249
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,300
he must have called
Garrick to trigger the hit.

250
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,570
- I'll handle the body.
- "Handle"?

251
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,260
We need the bullets. We can't have
ballistics traced to your weapon.

252
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,900
Okay, wait. I can't do
this. I'm a federal agent.

253
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,170
I have two directives...

254
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,260
To protect you and find my employer.

255
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,900
I intend to do both.

256
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,560
My team will be here soon. Find his car.

257
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,320
210 over 145.

258
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,400
103.7.

259
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,270
Increase the dosage.

260
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,760
We're already 12 cc over the max.

261
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,210
Then why isn't it working?!

262
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,310
He's resisting somehow.

263
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,610
I can stick him again,

264
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,230
but if his heart goes into
v-fib, we could lose him.

265
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,230
Stick him again.

266
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,700
I ran his face against the database.

267
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,130
What database?

268
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,780
No matches.

269
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,830
The car is registered
to Borderland Cargo...

270
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,420
a shell corp with a dummy address.

271
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,110
What about the GPS data?

272
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,250
If he works for the man holding Red,
then maybe he's been there before.

273
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,120
You have six addresses.
Five are centrally located...

274
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,100
A motel, a church, two gas stations,

275
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,650
and a restaurant in Alexandria.

276
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,290
But this? This is something.

277
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,300
Why?

278
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,580
It's an industrial neighborhood, remote.

279
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,980
The kind of place I'd find for Mr.
Reddington if I didn't want him to be found.

280
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,200
Time for a road trip.

281
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,020
Armed lookouts.

282
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,100
What are you doing?

283
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Calling it in. We need backup.

284
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,000
Stay in the car. My orders
are to keep you safe.

285
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,000
I think we're ready here.

286
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,430
About bloody time.

287
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,660
We've got company.

288
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,080
What the hell is this place?

289
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,860
He's not here.

290
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,180
How are we?

291
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,070
He's ready for you, sir.

292
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,230
Hello, Ray.

293
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,370
It's been, what... 20 years? Hmm?

294
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,940
Tell me, Agent Keen, which part
of "stand down" was unclear to you?

295
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,630
This wasn't my operation.

296
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,520
Fowler may have shut us
down, but did you really think

297
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Reddington's people weren't
gonna try to find him themselves?

298
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
They did this without your involvement?

299
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,910
The only reason you're standing here

300
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,380
is because they trust
me enough to involve me.

301
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,550
Enlighten me. What is all this?

302
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,100
Some kind of operations outpost
three miles from the post office.

303
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,730
Seems to be manned by the same people

304
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,970
who infiltrated our facility
and kidnapped Reddington.

305
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,110
That doesn't concern you?

306
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,580
I lost a dozen people today, Keen!

307
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,300
That isn't on you. It's on me.

308
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
No one wants the men who
did this more than I do.

309
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,370
But riding shotgun on an unsanctioned
massacre isn't the way to get it done.

310
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,570
- Excuse me, Director Cooper?
- What is it?

311
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,930
There's something you need to see.

312
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,450
I thought I was clear...
This task force is done.

313
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,170
I think you'll reconsider.

314
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,790
Why in God's name would I do that?

315
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,880
Because this isn't just
about Reddington anymore.

316
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
Agent Keen located a surveillance
outpost a few miles from here.

317
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,310
Next-gen tech, better than
anything we have in the field.

318
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,250
- Surveillance on what?
- Us.

319
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,400
They've been watching this
task force for months...

320
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,420
Phone taps, communications logs...
We're not sure to what extent.

321
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,210
We were able to recover very little.

322
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,310
The equipment and data were
rigged to self-destruct.

323
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,230
I don't understand. How
is this even possible?

324
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,980
Something else you should know.

325
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,410
They've been watching you, too.

326
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,430
All right, that's enough. Let him down.

327
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,110
Come on. Get him a chair.

328
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,630
I don't understand, Ray.

329
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,930
None of this had to happen.

330
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,530
I thought we had an arrangement.

331
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,830
We do.

332
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,110
Eh, I don't know.

333
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,070
The people I represent,
they're... they're nervous.

334
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,410
We don't know what to think.

335
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,950
We could've killed you.

336
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,680
I don't mean today. I mean any day.

337
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,870
I mean every day for
the past two decades.

338
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,690
But we don't.

339
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,400
We know what you have, Ray.

340
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,690
And we know what'll happen
to it if you turn up dead.

341
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,440
So we do nothing. We let you live.

342
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:21,710
And in exchange, we... we trust
that our secret remains secret.

343
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,250
- Nothing has changed.
- Oh, no. I'd say everything's changed.

344
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,380
Everything changed the minute
you surrendered to the FBI.

345
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,570
Did you think we wouldn't know?

346
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,700
Maybe you wanted to
change our arrangement.

347
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,620
Maybe you thought you
could turn yourself in

348
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,270
and, uh, find some new
friends to protect you.

349
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,910
- Maybe you plan to expose us.
- No.

350
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,830
What have you told, Ray?

351
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,470
Nothing.

352
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,210
Then what the hell are you doing here?

353
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,540
My reasons have
n-nothing to do with you.

354
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,860
Well, I hope so. I really do.

355
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,890
Because I've always liked you, Ray.

356
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,710
You're a pain in my neck, but...

357
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,400
I like you.

358
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,080
Just know this...

359
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,130
You were walking in
the park this morning.

360
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,850
We could've taken you then.

361
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,640
Instead, we dragged you
from the safety and security

362
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,510
of the bed you're now
sharing with new friends.

363
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,530
Why would we do a thing like that?

364
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,110
To make it abundantly clear...

365
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,450
There's nowhere you can go...

366
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,780
There's no one you can
trust to keep you from us.

367
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,860
You were there? When Reddington's
people took the building?

368
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,200
- How many people were killed?
- At least six.

369
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,360
It was an outpost. Professionals.

370
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,290
These people were highly trained.

371
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,580
Like Garrick.

372
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,070
- What's all this?
- A waste of time.

373
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,000
By Cooper's directive, I reached out to
a few of our colleagues at the Agency,

374
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,680
informed them of our situation,
and offered to contact

375
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,450
my counterparts at the other
black sites to share intel.

376
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,960
All these names are redacted.

377
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,920
So much for inter-agency cooperation.

378
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,940
You really think that Garrick
had someone on the inside?

379
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,360
It's possible.

380
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,020
The only one beyond
suspicion is Ressler,

381
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,390
unless he used Garrick to shoot
him in the leg to cover his tracks.

382
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,740
- Is he still in surgery?
- Four hours and counting.

383
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,490
{\a6}****

384
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,920
Hollins Ferry Road. I know that address.

385
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,550
It says DCM... What does that mean?

386
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,220
Decommissioned.

387
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,660
Here I am trying to help, and the
only names that aren't blacked out

388
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,120
are sites that are no longer in use.

389
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,790
Is that a church?

390
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,770
Well, that's the cover story.

391
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,480
- I'm gonna need satellite access to this address.
- Why?

392
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,160
Because I think this might be
where they're holding Reddington.

393
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,460
- Is this in Franklin Square?
- Yeah. Why?

394
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,280
The ambulance that was
used to abduct Reddington

395
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,630
they found burning in a garage
a quarter mile from there.

396
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,620
I think we found Reddington.

397
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,850
Where?

398
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,460
A church in Baltimore...
A decommissioned black site.

399
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,480
A black site? You think that's
where they're holding Reddington?

400
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,750
It makes sense. It's the
last place we would think of.

401
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,710
And if he knew about this
site, he'd know about others.

402
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,210
What about it, Diane? I need an answer.

403
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,840
Are we shut down or not?

404
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,420
You should go, sir.

405
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,890
- I'll take care of Reddington.
- No.

406
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,880
We had a deal.

407
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,930
I delivered him for interrogation.

408
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,090
- I took that risk because you promised...
- I know what we promised.

409
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,260
What I don't know is whether
he's telling the truth.

410
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,960
If you kill him, it could
trigger whatever he has in place.

411
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,530
With all due respect,
sir, that's not my problem.

412
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,110
- Excuse me?
- I lost a lot of men today...

413
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,580
Couple of good ones.

414
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,060
You had your talk.

415
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,490
Now it's my turn.

416
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,350
Just you and me again, Red.

417
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,520
Just like the old days.

418
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,880
Oh, give it a rest. We both know
Fitch won't let you finish it.

419
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,460
That's as may be.

420
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,430
But you know what I can do, though, Red?

421
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,090
I can find Lizzy.

422
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,380
I can hurt her. I can make her suffer.

423
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,190
And when I'm finished, I can kill her.

424
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,500
Sometimes you just have to take
what you can in this crazy world.

425
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,150
Guess who taught me that, Red.

426
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,370
You did.

427
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,630
What? No smart quips?

428
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,830
No?

429
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,270
You're not actually feeling
something, are you, Red?

430
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,410
Regret.

431
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,330
He was here.

432
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,110
In what world is any of this okay?

433
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,950
The fact that you don't see that,
that this is somehow normal to you...

434
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,280
- I'm sorry.
- A man told me that he was gonna kill you.

435
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,330
I've been attacked, I've been accused of
murder, and now people are watching us.

436
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,440
Apparently, there are
cameras in our bedroom.

437
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,970
- They're gone.
- Do you believe that?

438
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,750
I need us together... and safe.

439
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,640
I meant what I said earlier.

440
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,840
We need to leave this place.

441
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,650
Audrey? Hey. What are you doing here?

442
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,670
I got a call. You okay?

443
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,890
Yeah. Yeah, long story. Uh...

444
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,980
I'm fine.

445
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,850
- They called you?
- Bureau did.

446
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,910
I guess I'm still on
as your "next of kin."

447
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,280
Right. Your name's still on that list.

448
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I meant to take it off.
I've just been so busy, I...

449
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,560
No, no, no. It's okay. I get it.

450
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,390
So, you're okay?

451
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,290
You're engaged?

452
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,970
It's crazy, right?

453
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,620
Tell me he's fat and unemployed.

454
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,020
He's fat and unemployed.

455
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,710
Mind staying for a few minutes?

456
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,000
He was there.

457
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,610
- Lab tests confirm the blood was Reddington's.
- Which means?

458
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,920
As far as we can tell, he
killed his captor and escaped.

459
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,450
- Then why aren't you out hunting him down?
- I'm sorry?

460
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,160
I thought we were in the "cover our
asses" business, in containment mode.

461
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
That ship has sailed, Harold.

462
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,890
Someone is surveilling
us, and we don't know who.

463
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,810
- Reddington does.
- You don't know that.

464
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,190
We have a mole.

465
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,950
That mole leaked intel leading to the
abduction and torture of Reddington.

466
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,730
It's a simple math problem, Harold.

467
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,930
Whoever is after Reddington is after us,

468
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,030
and that means, as far as I'm concerned,

469
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,270
that Reddington still has real value.

470
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,260
The unit has a new focus... Finding him.

471
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,560
As of this moment,

472
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,290
the only target on the
blacklist is Raymond Reddington.

473
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,030
It's done.

474
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,110
Hello?

475
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,900
Lizzy.

476
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,300
Red.

477
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,810
Where are you?

478
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,810
Gone for a short while.

479
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,520
Dembe's looking for
you. He says it's urgent.

480
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,340
Dembe will have to wait.

481
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,810
Lizzy...

482
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,720
I want you to know, wherever
I am, whatever I'm doing,

483
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,700
if you are in need, I will be there.

484
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,190
The task force, Cooper...
They're searching for you.

485
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,910
What should I tell them?

486
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,690
- I have to go.
- Wait.

487
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,710
One question, please.

488
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,900
It's about my father.

489
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,690
Growing up, Sam... He
raised me like his own.

490
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,250
He was...

491
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,350
my whole world.

492
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,270
But he wasn't my father.

493
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,540
What is the question, Lizzy?

494
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,260
Are you my father?

495
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,490
No.

496
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,790
Lizzy...

497
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,730
be careful of your husband.

498
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,280
