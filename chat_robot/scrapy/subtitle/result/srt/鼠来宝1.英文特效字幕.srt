{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Whatever.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe we should take a break.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's it. I can't take this anymore.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't. I give up.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sick of struggling for survival.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Competing with gophers and earthworms and that loser sparrow...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...who always takes my nuts.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pants.

21
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need pants. Pants are essential.

22
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Claire.

23

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Dave. - Hey.

24
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How's it going?

25
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I haven't seen you since...

26
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, since you said you never wanted to see me again.

27
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I guess it worked.

28
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What a fun day that was.

29
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me guess. You're late for something again.

30
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Same old Dave. - Not following you.

31
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, the guy who's always fooling around...

32
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...who can't handle a serious relationship.

33
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That was the old Dave.

34
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about we get together, talk about the new Dave?

35
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tomorrow night. My place.

36
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I... - Great.

37
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No... - You look good, Claire.

38
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are we?

39
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I think they remodeled our forest. I like it. Stylish, yet functional.

40
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where did the mountains go?

41
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Give me a break. We're in a building, Theodore.

42
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave.

43
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Lan. - Hey, big guy.

44
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, you ever seen the view from the 80th floor?

45
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. They never let me past the lobby. - What? I can't...

46
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, back off, man, this is Dave Seville.

47
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Seville, can I offer you some muffins, scones, pastries?

48
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. I'd hate to be a bother.

49
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's no problem. We have an omelet station.

50
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Omelet station.

51
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I get you some water or a soy latte?

52
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about a shot of wheatgrass juice?

53
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe later. Thanks.

54
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's talk about your song, Dave.

55
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, as crazy as it sounds...

56
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...the original inspiration came to me... - The song sucks, Dave.

57
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Your song? It's awful. I hate it.

58
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it? Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

59
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need something new. I need something fresh.

60
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- That is new. - The next big thing.

61
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave, we go way back, all right?

62
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And we've both come a long way since college. You? Not so much.

63
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wanted to like that song, but you heard it. Not that good.

64
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If I wasn't your friend, I'd say:

65
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Dave, you go right back out of this office...

66
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and you keep writing music. You'll get there someday."

67
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I am your friend, so I'm going to tell you...

68
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...that there is no sense in writing songs...

69
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...that no one is ever, ever going to sing.

70
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ever?

71
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Excuse me.

72
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I get some of that water?

73
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We ran out.

74
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey!

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Out of the way. - Alvin...

76
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...slow down. - Move your butt, Theodore.

77
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You stepped on my tail.

78
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Last one to the door is roadkill.

79
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm in.

80
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are these shiny things?

81
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Theodore, we're leaving now.

82
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, this wasn't my best idea. Look out!

83
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maniac!

84
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back to tree. Back to tree.

85
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

86
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Basket! Three o'clock. - Which way is 3 o'clock?

87
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- This way. - Guys, wait for me.

88
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait up. I still have baby fat, you know.

89
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Jump. You've gotta really want it. - I want it.

90
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I want it. - I can't hang like this all day.

91
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will you jump already?

92
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Muffins.

93
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Gross. Is this his house?

94
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. It's his garbage can.

95
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This must be where he stores his food for winter.

96
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}As it came down to one...

97
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch with no way out.

98
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}As the boa moves in for the attack...

99
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...the mouse seems to be facing certain death.

100
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The boa's sensitive tongue tastes the victim's presence.

101
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The mouse crashes through the foliage.

102
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, baby. Come to papa!

103
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, gorgeous.

104
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've hit the mother lode.

105
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Tropical rainforest where food is bountiful.

106
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is the greatest day of my life.

107
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

108
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin, what are you doing? Don't make a mess.

109
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cannonball.

110
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quick. Hide.

111
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hurry, you guys.

112
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did I put these here?

113
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There you are. I got you.

114
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's been out for quite a while.

115
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You guys, he's dead.

116
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

117
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need three garbage bags, a shovel, some disinfectant...

118
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...some latex gloves and oregano, go!

119
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.

120
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I must be hearing things.

121
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, this is trippy.

122
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sir, are you all right?

123
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get back!

124
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Squirrels can't talk.

125
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey.

126
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Watch it, genius.

127
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

128
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Chipmunks can't talk either.

129
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our lips are moving and words are coming out.

130
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is not happening.

131
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am not talking to chipmunks. I am not talking to chipmunks.

132
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So how's that working for you, Dave?

133
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you know my name?

134
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll field that one. We read your mail. By accident.

135
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You really ought to pay that utility bill, Dave.

136
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You ever heard of a credit rating? - What's this thing?

137
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop doing... Turn that off.

138
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry.

139
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He fell out of the tree at birth.

140
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can all animals talk?

141
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I believe fish have this type of sign language.

142
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses that smell like sweat socks?

143
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave likes to wear

144
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dirty underwear with little hairs

145
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're getting off on the wrong foot.

146
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Allow us to introduce ourselves.

147
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

148
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He's Alvin. - The awesomest one.

149
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I'm Theodore.

150
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, nice to meet you. Now get out of my house.

151
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But we talk.

152
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Which makes me want you out of my house that much more.

153
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

154
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I kind of liked him better when he was unconscious.

155
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Gotcha. - Hey.

156
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't do this, Dave.

157
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can gnaw right through this door.

158
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hi.

159
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, were we disturbing you?

160
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What, you guys can sing too?

161
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's not singing. This is singing.

162
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is amazing.

163
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here, everyone inside.

164
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- There you go. - Thank you.

165
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, here's the deal.

166
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You guys sing my songs, you get to sleep here.

167
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. Wait. Is breakfast included?

168
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can live with that.

169
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What about TV privileges?

170
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, but not after 7.

171
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Eight. - Done.

172
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But don't tell your animal friends, because I don't wanna come home...

173
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and find rabbits and skunks on my couch.

174
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Filthy creatures, Dave. Never associate with them.

175
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, you're our only friend.

176
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, no, no. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

177
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's just start with me being your songwriter.

178
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me ask you. Have you ever written a song before?

179
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yup. - And is that your music stuff outside?

180
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yup.

181
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no!

182
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hurry back.

183
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, fellas, all we gotta do is find the right song, rehearse...

184
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hey, Dave. - Simon.

185
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My bad.

186
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is my sheet music.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is not a Hula-Hoop. It's a towel rack.

189
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Killjoy. - Are you guys always like this?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, where are your parents?

192
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When you're a chipmunk, your parents take care of you for a week.

193
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then they take off.

194
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our parents were hippies. They left early to join a commune.

195
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I am Robert the Robot. - Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!

196
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's after me. - Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.

197

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I got it for Christmas last year. - Christmas! We love Christmas.

199
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Even though we've never actually celebrated it.

200
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But we want to.

201

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, maybe we can celebrate it with you.

203
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, maybe.

204
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I've had a long and weird day, so off to bed.

205
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed by 8.

208
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My tail isn't bushy till 9.

209
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not my problem. Now go to sleep.

210
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope Christmas comes fast.

216
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!

217
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,810

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing. What are you doing?

219
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Four. No, no, no. Eight? Counting your thumb?

225
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Wait, wait, wait... - Hang on a second.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...a big box with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

280
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...who not only speak English but can sing."

281
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They do sing. We've been practicing all morning.

282
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you've been practicing. I never realized. Okay, well.

283
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Okay, no. Dave, I'm going to pretend...

284
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...that I have a lunch to go to.

285
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got a lunch to go to.

286
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that?

287
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing. Nothing. Just a little stage fright.

288
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought my heart was gonna explode.

289
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're not performing monkeys.

290
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why do we have to sing for that guy?

291
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, how's this?

292
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pretend I need the money and I hate my job...

293
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and you're staying at my place, so you owe me.

294
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're sorry, Dave.

295
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, that helps.

296
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Never mind. I'm late for work.

297
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can we go with you?

298
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What, so you can mess that up too?

299
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're going home.

300
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I stand in your lap and steer?

301
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, can we at least beep the horn?

302
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Never mind.

303
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So sorry about the delay. It should be a couple more minutes.

304
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But we're building the suspense.

305
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Here he is. - Sorry I'm late.

306
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boy, am I jazzed about our Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.

307
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's Good-able Energy Bar commercial.

308
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right, Good-able.

309
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, here's the pitch.

310
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We open on a group of lethargic kids.

311
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Close-up on a little girl's face. She's sad.

312
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our customers don't like to think of their kids as being sad.

313
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Could she be flying a kite?

314
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I like kites.

315
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good.

316
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, great. She's flying a kite.

317
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's running with a kite. She's running out of steam.

318
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's tired and lets go of the kite.

319
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.

320
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- But not too sad. - Right.

321
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So she pulls out her Good-able Energy Bar...

322
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's my mom. Sorry.

323
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hi, Mom. - A little situation, Dave.

324
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

325
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Alvin. - Dave, help!

326
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.

327
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just stay calm.

328
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And there goes Theodore.

329
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

330
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I absolutely understand but... Sorry, Dave?

331
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quick question.

332
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you feel about an indoor pool?

333
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, if you flood my house, you're dead.

334
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Out on the street, capiche?

335
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mothers.

336
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't we come over here and look at the sales projections?

337
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, when I first saw these numbers, I thought there's just no way...

338
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but then I looked again.

339
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The "size of Theodore's butt"?

340
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't we come back to that?

341
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share for healthy food snacks...

342
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...was imperceptible among 6- to 12-year-olds.

343
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"How smart Simon thinks he is"?

344
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, as opposed to how smart he actually is.

345
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who's Simon?

346
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I didn't... - Just move it along.

347
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what? I think I'll just clean out my office.

348
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sounds good.

349
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}SpongeBob. You're 15 minutes late.

350
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary.

351
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He got away. Well...

352
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys. What's this about?

353
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Obviously, Theodore's butt.

354
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We told you we colored.

355
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}On my presentation boards? You got me fired.

356
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We didn't know.

357
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We're sorry, Dave. - Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

358
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry doesn't get my job back, now, does it, Theodore?

359
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why are my clothes all over the place?

360
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We used them to mop up the water. Good idea, right?

361
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just...?

362
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a raisin, Dave.

363
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Prove it.

364
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, you got me.

365
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wanna talk to all you guys. Where's Alvin?

366
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Alvin? - You owe me bigtime.

367
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin.

368
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. Come on.

369
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's this new thing. It's called knocking.

370
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Get out. - I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.

371
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Out. - I'm taking a shower here.

372
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, if I made a list of my worst days ever...

373
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...today would be at the top of the list.

374
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's still early.

375
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Clam it, sudsy.

376
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. Guys, let me just put it to you like this, okay?

377
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have no job, no career, my house is always a mess. Thank you very much.

378
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling. And why did I just say my last name?

379
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That was weird. I guess I'm just a little nervous about coming over for dinner.

380
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Dinner. - So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.

381
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.

382
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's half an hour.

383
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who's Claire?

384
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Claire is Dave's mate.

385
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She is not my mate.

386
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's my ex-mate.

387
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. This is great.

388
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave. Dave, relax.

389
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You just go get the food. We'll take care of the rest.

390
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why am I having a hard time believing you?

391
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

392
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave. - Like a family.

393
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. Not like a family.

394
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.

395
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right.

396
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We also do offices and recreational vehicles.

397
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's that smell?

398
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's your cologne.

399
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What did you do? Dump the entire bottle on the rug?

400
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We call it scenting the area.

401
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I gotta admit I'm surprised.

402
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The place looks great.

403
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, Dave, we chipmunks are notoriously tidy.

404
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I see that.

405
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Those bread sticks smell great. - Yeah.

406
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So when's dinner?

407
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys, I don't know how to tell you this...

408
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

409
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold the phone, Dave.

410
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We can't have... - No.

411
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Even if we... - No.

412
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We thought it... - And no. Look, in the other room.

413
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeez.

414
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What a buzzkill, man.

415
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I never knew you could cook this well. - It's all about slow roasting.

416
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It takes longer. But when it comes to flavor, why rush?

417
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I'm impressed.

418
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I've been seeing your photos. - Yeah, it's going really great.

419
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about you, how's your job?

420
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Great. Loving it.

421
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you think it's going?

422
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Terrible. They're not even sniffing each other.

423
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin. Dave said that...

424
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave needs a little help from the love doctor.

425
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And his assistant.

426
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get back here.

427
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, this is nice.

428
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just two friends having dinner. Hanging out.

429
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No pressure. Nothing weird.

430
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My stereo does that all the time. It's like it has a mind of its own.

431
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You were saying?

432
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous about coming over here.

433
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wasn't sure if you thought this was a date or something.

434
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A date? No.

435
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The wiring in my unit is shot.

436
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You should get an electrician to fix that.

437
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't need anyone to fix anything for me.

438
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

439
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Could you excuse me for a moment? I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

440
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey.

441
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I know what you guys are up to. Alvin.

442
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Breath check. - Where's Al...?

443
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave, are you okay?

444
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everything's fine.

445
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why did you do that?

446
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was just trying to help, Dave. You have garlic breath.

447
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, stop helping. You're ruining everything.

448
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think I got something in my eye.

449
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here. Let me see.

450
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:33,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. It looks really irritated. It's so red. What happened?

451
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that?

452
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

453
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- A rat? - Probably nothing.

454
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here, let's finish eating, huh?

455
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tomorrow, I'm gonna call the exterminator.

456
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Claire.

457
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave? Dave?

458
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Tell her she completes you. - What are you doing?

459
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You got it, Dave. - Dave.

460
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave, let go.

461
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry, Claire. It's just...

462
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I lost my job, Claire.

463
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I guess I just needed a hug.

464
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, why didn't you just say so? Tell me what happened.

465
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, this is gonna sound really strange.

466
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No games. No fooling around.

467
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- The truth? - Please, I'm begging you.

468
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My life is being sabotaged by talking chipmunks.

469
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You know what? - I'm not crazy, I swear.

470
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You haven't changed at all.

471
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

472
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Chipmunks.

473
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You should've kissed her, Dave.

474
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She wanted you.

475
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin, you're not helping.

476
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't give up, Dave.

477
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go away. Leave me alone.

478
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave, would you like a cookie?

479
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I said, leave me alone.

480
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is it me, or was he a little mad?

481
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

482
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He really did have garlic breath.

483
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, well-played, guys.

484
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Idea.

485
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who has cab fare?

486
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cab fare? We don't even have pockets.

487
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but this isn't really working out.

488
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know what made me think I could handle you guys...

489
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...when I can barely manage my own life.

490
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You should go back to your real home in the forest.

491
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's what's best for all of us.

492
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry it has to be this way, but...

493
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys?

494
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Simon, Theodore?

495
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys?

496
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin?

497
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin!

498
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Simon?

499
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Theodore?

500
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin?

501
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin.

502
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello?

503

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Kids.

505
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Christmas, Christmastime is near

506
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Time for toys and time for cheer

507
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can't hardly stand the wait

508
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, Christmas, don't be late

509
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Welcome to Jett Records.

510
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. New rule. No going out after 9.

511
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And not at all unless I know where you're going.

512
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Were you worried about us, Dave?

513
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. I just need to know, that's all.

514
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait. If you're not worried, then why do you need to know?

515
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need to know, okay?

516
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin.

517

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

518
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sorry. - Kids, huh?

519
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They keep you on your toes. Do you have any?

520
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Three boys.

521
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, some days are better than others.

522
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And some days you just wanna close them in a box...

523
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...leave the box in the park and run away, you know?

524
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quick, hide.

525
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys, what's all this?

526
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toaster waffles.

527
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I can't afford all these toaster waffles.

528
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Well, in case you didn't notice...

529
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I don't have a job anymo...

530
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My song?

531
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- All right. - Yeah.

532
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hello? - Hey, Dave.

533
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

534
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Lan? - Tell me you've heard the song.

535
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

536
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How did you...? When did...?

537
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Speed of business, baby. That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

538
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Got a friend in satellite radio, put it in immediate rotation.

539
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And that video of your little guys, 10 million hits already on YouTube.

540
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's crazy. I gotta go.

541
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, put some clothes on those guys. It's kind of embarrassing.

542
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We owed you, Dave.

543
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So we're good with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?

544
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Soup's on.

545
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin.

546
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what do you think?

547
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cool.

548
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right.

549
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

550
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

551
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave...

552
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...are you awake?

553
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am now.

554
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had a nightmare.

555
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I sleep with you?

556
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You won't even know I'm here.

557
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. Sure. But stay on that side of the bed.

558
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, okay.

559
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Theodore, that's not your side of the bed.

560
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas. - Come on, man. It's Christmas.

561
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

562
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}On the first day of Christmas Dave woke up

563
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, man, it's Christmas. Hallelujah.

564
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wake up, lazy bones.

565
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, yeah. Christmas.

566
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Up and at them. - You can sleep when you're dead.

567
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm coming - Come on, Dave.

568
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hurry up, Dad.

569
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Dad? - Dave. I said Dave.

570
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is shaping up to be my favorite Christmas ever.

571
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You want to open mine first. - Open mine first.

572
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No, Dave, mine is better. - You guys got me presents?

573
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course.

574
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Simon?

575
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow, it's a...

576

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a paper-clip compass.

577
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A paper-clip compass. Now I'll never get lost.

578
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Me next.

579
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin.

580
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- My wallet. - Do you like it?

581
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really? I wanted to get you something you'd use every day.

582
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I have been using this for almost 10 years now.

583
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.

584
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, the look on your face says it all, Dave.

585
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, nicely done, Theodore. "To Dav."

586
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's see, it says, "Merry Christmas. Love, Theodore."

587
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's got a nice picture of some pineapples?

588
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those aren't pineapples. That's our family.

589
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, fellas. Let's make sure we understand each other here.

590
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not your...

591
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, your dad or anything, right?

592
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you're like a dad.

593
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, not really.

594
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, we're friends for sure.

595
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I write your music, you know, manage your career.

596
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Make us sweaters. - Feed us.

597

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let us sleep in your bed when we have nightmares.

598
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's what friends do.

599
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So who wants to open their presents?

600
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Is that a trick question? We do. - Yeah.

601
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Presents. - Oh boy.

603
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't wait to open mine first.

604
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Envelopes.

605

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're savings bonds.

606
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cool.

608
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you maybe have any that you bought seven years ago?

609
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Alvin, manners. - Thank you, Dave.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Weird. What happened to your presents?

619
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Which one is mine? - That big one is for me, I think.

620

00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll probably go into insulin shock. But it's worth it.

738
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, a sweet, sweet, sweet molasses meat.

739
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Alvster. Love the song, bro.

740
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Up top. - What's up, player?

741
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I see you're enjoying my little spread that I've put out for you guys.

742
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What am I talking about? You probably eat like this all the time.

743
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, Dave says he doesn't wanna spoil us.

744
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dude, you're a rock star. You're supposed to be spoiled.

745
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, you should be riding in limousines and private planes.

746
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And you should be going to parties like this every night.

747
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really? Because Dave says we need our sleep.

748
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, Alvin, this is hard to say but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

749
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave's holding you back, you know. I could be making you 20 large a day.

750
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Is that a lot? - Yes.

751
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Another thing... I'm not gonna tell you. I will tell you.

752
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, behind your back, Dave calls you...

753
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}..."the rats."

754
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Rats? - Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

755
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:44,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, don't let it bother you. I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

756
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And if there's anything you need, anything at all...

757
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...give your uncle lan a call, all right?

758
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, right. - Ciao.

759
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, pal. You drive like my grandmother.

760
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get a wheelchair. Move over!

761
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:09,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, guys, look at me. Up, up and away.

762
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin.

763
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't help you, Simon. I'm about to take the lead here.

764
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:20,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, guys, I have an idea for a new song.

765
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Dave.

766
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's going on in here? I thought I told you guys to clean up.

767
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We are.

768
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Who's that? - Uncle lan hired us a housekeeper.

769
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's also a masseuse.

770
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, move over, road hog.

771
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Drive it or park it, pal. Get in the slow lane.

772
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Where did you get that game? - Uncle lan.

773
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Move it or lose it! Get some training wheels, buddy.

774
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, you know what?

775
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's enough.

776
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you doing? I was about to beat my high score.

777
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Too bad. Where's Theodore?

778
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Spit it out.

779
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Spit it out. - No.

780
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jett Records.

781
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now. Everyone on the couch.

782
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Could you give us a minute?

783
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

784
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Three months ago, you were hanging out in a tree somewhere and now you're...

785
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Major rock stars.

786
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. Whatever. My point is just because you're...

787
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Major rock stars.

788
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Doesn't mean you can have or do whatever you want.

789
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, Uncle lan says we should always be happy.

790
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, you know what?

791
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's not your uncle.

792
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He also, David, said that we should be making $20 a day.

793
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guess what. You're making way more than that.

794
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And because I care, I'm putting it all away for you.

795
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just like storing nuts for the winter.

796
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, winter's for losers.

797
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:12,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Shouldn't we have a say in how to build our investment portfolio?

798
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where is all this coming from? You guys are just kids.

799
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Kids, Dave, or rats? - What?

800
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, Uncle lan says we're like his family.

801
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, yeah? Well, if you love Uncle lan so much...

802
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and don't think I'm watching out for you...

803
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...why don't you go live with Uncle lan?

804
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave?

805
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you still mad at us?

806
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave?

807
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but...

808
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You should go back to your real home in the forest."

809
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess he really does want us to go.

810
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I told you, Dave.

811
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I never lose.

812
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boys, welcome to your new home.

813
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, yeah. Daddy's home. - Yeah.

814
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can we play with all this stuff?

815
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sure, why not? It's your house.

816
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what are the rules around here?

817
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I do have one rule...

818
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:20,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...that there are no rules! - Cool.

819
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Four degrees elevation.

820
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Six degrees azimuth.

821
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fire!

822

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Prepare to face the fury of my vengeance.

823
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't make me laugh.

824
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pray for a quick demise, young chipmunk.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

826
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:13,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your kung fu is no match for my rockets.

827

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And these guys don't need the extra pressure.

918
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We'll send you a postcard. - Lan, you can't do this.

919
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're not ready for something like that. They're just kids.

920
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:43,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm gonna see them. - Look, Dave, I'm... Wait.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Lan? - Yeah? What?

922
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Lan. - I can't...

923
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}lan...

924
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...was that Dave?

925
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. Yes, it was.

926
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He wanted me to let you know he's great and he's happy.

927
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's really, really happy. So... All right.

928
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And is he coming to the show?

929
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what? I sent him tickets. And here's the thing, he sent them back.

930
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:23,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy, you know. Got better things to do.

931
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:26,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, come on. What's with the long furry faces?

932
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,120

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll tell you what, you guys like deep-tissue massage? All right?

934
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know a guy. Let me call my guy. I'll get on that.

935

938
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If he shows up tomorrow night, he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

939
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Got it? Okay. - Got it.

940

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What are you doing here? - Can I sleep with you?

942
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had a nightmare.

943
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you had a nightmare?

944
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had a nightmare too. In my nightmare...

945
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:30,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I had to put together 37 dates in 42 days, in 16 different countries.

946
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:35,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I had to coordinate 121 different radio and print interviews...

947
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:38,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...in five different languages.

948
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:41,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you know what, Theo? The only difference is...

949
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:46,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...in my nightmare, when I open my eyes, it doesn't end.

950
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So is that a no?

951
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys...

952
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I wanna go home.

953
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you mean? You are home.

954
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I mean, "home" home.

955
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, with Dave.

956

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But, Theodore, come on. Wake up and smell the toffee.

957
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't care enough to even come to our show.

958
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:47,660

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are swirling around the singing sensation.

961

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is it because of toaster waffle overload? Or a rigorous tour schedule?

962
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's hard to say. But manager-producer lan Hawke has assured Fox...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could give you a lot of fancy terms, but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

972
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, well, give them a shot or a cream or a pill or something.

1083
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:52,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave, they're chipmunks who talk. People will come.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a figure of speech, Simon.

1089
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Instead of criticizing me, why not use your big brain to think of a way out?

1090
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:33,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go, go, go. Go.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can get out of a cat carrier. Not even hard to do.

1096
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You came back for us.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, of course I came back. We're a family.

1098
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Holy nuts.

1099

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Am I going crazy?

1100
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or did he just say "family"?

1101
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know...

1102
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but I really missed you guys.

1103
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I missed you too, Dave.

1104
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,220

1105
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- So did Alvin. He's too cool to admit it. - Yeah, too macho.

1106
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Missed you too.

1107
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:54,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry, I had some sentimentality stuck in my throat.

1108
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just said, I missed you too.

1109
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Whatever. Who are you guys to judge me?

1110
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, you know what? I miss my friend Dave, okay?

1111
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:08,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll scream it from the rooftops. And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

1112
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's right. I love you, Dave.

1113
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,780

1115
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now can I steer? Oh, please, please, please.

1116
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I want to work the windshield wipers. - Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

1117
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have at it, fellas.

1118

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm a good beeper. - Save some horn for the rest of us.

1119
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Come on, Dave, drive faster. - Not with you steering.

1120
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.

1121
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Okay, Alvin, that's enough. - Enough of what? Of being awesome?

1122
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Alvin, I said that's enough.

1123
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:47,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, look, Dave, no paws.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, if you guys behave, maybe I'll let you call me "Uncle lan" again.

1125
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Deal?
