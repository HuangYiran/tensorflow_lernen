<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:12,138
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,340
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

5
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:15,642
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

6
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:18,144
<i>in Africa, Europe</i>
<i>and the Middle East.</i>

7
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:20,747
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

8
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,649
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

9
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,484
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

10
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:26,319
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

11
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,187
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

12
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:29,155
This was an act of terrorism.

13
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:31,524
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

14
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:34,094
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

15
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,228
is one of the good old
favorites.

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,664
...until something stops him.

17
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

18
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:42,035
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

19
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:45,238
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,674
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

21
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:51,845
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

22
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:59,886
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

23
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:01,888
<i>I've ever known.</i>

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,556
<i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

25
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:05,859
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,431
<i>Take 'em.</i>

00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,433
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

28

Homeland - 3x10
"Good Night"

29
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:26,212
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

30
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:28,648
The bomber's the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,483
What the fuck
are you doing, Carrie?

32
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,286
Carrie, turn around now.

33
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:36,089
This is your last warning.

34
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:41,394
<i>We got a gunshot wound
to the upper left bicep.</i>

35
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:43,263
Significant bleeding.
Might have clipped an artery.

36
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,964
Where the fuck is Saul?

37
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:52,639
<i>He's not what we expected.</i>

38
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,741
<i>But he's what we've got.</i>

39
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:56,476
<i>The guy's a junkie... sir.</i>

40
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,179
I'm offering you the chance
to be a Marine again.

41
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,181
No more. I...

42
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,082
I'm done.

43
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,517
I have a play.

44
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,319
It involves Brody.

45
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:09,088
- You told me Javadi was the play.
- He is.

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,757
Brody's the next phase.

47
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,792
So, what is it?
What's your big idea?

48
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:13,993
Darnish Akbari.

49
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,929
Head of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard.

50
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,163
Right.

51
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:18,932
Javadi's boss.

52
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:21,334
And the single greatest
impediment to peace.

53
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,102
I want him gone.

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,204
Brody can get to him.

55
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:25,939
Do what Saul's asking.

56
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:26,773
What you're asking.

57
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,208
All right, what I'm asking.

58
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,009
Look at me, Carrie.

59
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,478
<i>You couldn't send me out for</i>
<i>a pack of cigarettes right now.</i>

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,614
<i>We'll get you ready.</i>

61
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,349
<i>You just have to be willing.</i>

62
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:38,952
<i>The guys get me to the border</i>

63
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,353
where I surrender myself?

64
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:41,888
Correct, and we chose

65
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,490
Marivan, because
several Al Qaeda commanders

66
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:46,125
also asked
for political asylum there.

67
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:48,194
What make you think
I'll ever get close enough

68
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:49,629
to General Akbari
to take him out?

69
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,897
Javadi's on the ground.

70
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,665
We'll facilitate a meeting
between the two of you.

71
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,500
<i>I will come back from Tehran.</i>

72
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:56,469
<i>I know you will.</i>

73
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,137
<i>And not just for her.</i>

74
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,810
Brody?

75
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,715
See you on the other side.

76
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,668
Carrie
Carrie.

77
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:32,005
我们需要谈一谈
We need to talk.

78
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,273
谈什么？
What about?

79
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:35,008
关于你的肩膀？
How's your shoulder?

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,409
跟新的一样好
Brand fucking new.

81
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,077
我想消除咱们之间的误会
I want to clear the air

82
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,213
就是在汽车旅馆Franklin那一团糟之后
after that clusterfuck
with Franklin at the motel.

83
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:41,381
我没有兴趣
I'm not interested.

84
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:42,849
我已经厌倦那些鬼话
I'm so tired of
all the bullshit

85
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,351
和那些掩饰自己的人们，我甚至不想和你说话
and people covering their asses,
I can't even tell you.

86
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,686
那是一个直接的命令，Carrie
It was a direct order, Carrie.

87
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,355
我不想冒险让别人来开那枪
I didn't want to risk letting
someone else take the shot.

88
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,567
当你在做手术的时候，
While you were in surgery,

89
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,203
我看了一下你的医疗记录
I took a look
at your medical records.

90
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:06,572
你怎么？！
You what?!

91
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:10,209
我当时很担心我对你造成的伤害
I was worried
about the damage I'd done.

92
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,547
Carrie，你已经怀孕15个星期了
Carrie, you're
15 weeks pregnant.

93
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,983
- 所以呢？
- So?
- 所以，我认为
- So, I think

94
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:19,585
你应该考虑退出这次行动
you should consider sitting
this part of the operation out.

95
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:21,120
我为什么要那么做？
And why would I do that?

96
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:23,289
因为你不可能在这种情况下
Because it's impossible
for you to be objective

97
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,824
保持客观
under the circumstances.

98
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:27,226
这种情况是，我怀了Brody的孩子吗？
The circumstances being,
I'm carrying Brody's child?

99
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:29,062
是的
Yes.

100
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,965
好的，首先，孩子不是他的
Well, first of all,
it's not his,

101
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,433
非常谢谢你。其次呢，
thank you very much.
Second of all,

102
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:34,567
这跟你没有关系
it's none of your
damn business,

103
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,902
跟其他人也没有关系
or anyone else's,

104
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,837
所以你离我远点
so just stay the fuck
out of my way.

105
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,995
_

106
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,690
半生半熟的？
Medium rare?

107
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,095
嗯
Hmm.

108
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:04,297
很好吃，是吧？
Pretty fucking tasty, huh?

109
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,766
嗯...嗯，是的
Hmm... hmm. Yeah.

110
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:10,203
诀窍就是在隔断他的喉咙之前
The secret is to relax the goat

111
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:12,038
先让山羊放松
before you cut his throat.

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,607
这就是为什么Modarres牙关紧闭而且膝盖疼痛
Which is why Modarres
has lockjaw and sore knees.

113
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,729
- 他们怎么样？
- How are they doing?
- 嗯
- Mm.

114
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,999
不错。穿过Kurdistan的行动平静无事
Good. That move across
Kurdistan was uneventful.

115
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,300
现在...
Now...

116
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:44,670
他们就在那边。他们正在等待夜幕降临，那个时候
that's them right there. They're waiting
for nightfall, at which point,

117
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:46,139
他们讲开车送他(Brody)到边境上
they'll drive him
right up to the border

118
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,574
这里，将掩护他通过伊朗的人工检查点
here, cover him across
to the manned checkpoint

119
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:51,044
就在那边
on the Iranian side,
right there.

120
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,550
国际事件的风险
<i>The risk</i>
<i>of an international incident</i>

121
00:05:57,552 --> 00:05:59,685
是总统非常关心的一个问题
is a serious concern
for the President.

122
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:04,090
我们非常确信那些我们告诉他的东西
We stand 100%
behind what we told him.

123
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,993
行动的回报值得我们冒这个险
The risk of this operation
is worth the reward.

124
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,495
而且，不太可能有什么事出错
And in the unlikely event
anything goes wrong,

125
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:11,264
我们都搞定了
we have it covered.

126
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:15,168
我都不想问这到底意味着什么
I'm not even going to
ask what that means.

127
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,569
他今晚所要做的就是
All he has to do tonight

128
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,272
穿过边境，请求政治避难
is walk across the border
and ask for asylum.

129
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:21,741
就是这样
That's it.

130
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:29,048
海军陆战队都这么做吗？
Is that a Marine thing?

131
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,852
将袜子里外翻个个儿，穿新的一面
Turn the socks inside out,
get the fresh side.

132
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,188
没有一面是新的
Well, there is no fresh side.

133
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,723
一面全是汗，另一面脏了
One side's sweaty,
and the other's just dirty.

134
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:40,927
好吧，也许我脑子里知道的就是这些
Well, maybe it's just
all in my head.

135
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,197
有用吗？
Does it work?

136
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,532
看着我
Well, look at me.

137
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:48,468
我是一个新人
I'm a new man.

138
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,869
通信检查
Comms check.

又是天堂的一天
Another day in paradise.

149
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,504
乘客(这里指Brody)怎么样？
How's the passenger doing?

150
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:26,739
不是很糟
Not bad.

151
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:29,475
对于一个锅盖头(美国海军陆战队士兵的谐称)来说
For a fucking jarhead.

152
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:32,245
就是这样了。Alpha完毕
That is all. Alpha out.

153
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:33,980
Bravo完毕
Bravo out.

154
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:39,085
越过边境后他要走到哪里？
What's he walking into
at the border crossing point?

155
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,287
嗨，Gene，你能把边界图片调出来吗？
Hey, Gene, can you bring up
the border photos, please?

156
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,822
马上出来
Coming up.

157
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,959
两个小时前
Yeah, as of two hours ago,

158
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,495
一个兵舍，里面有8个人，又一个中士指挥
one barrack hut for eight men,
commanded by a sergeant.

159
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:51,931
路边的守卫每四个小时换一次
Roadside guard hut manned
in four-hour shifts

160
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,367
他们有两个装备自动武器的人
by two men with
automatic weapons.

161
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,835
有没有关于伊朗巡逻队
Any updates on the Iranian

162
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:57,470
无线电通信的最新消息？
border patrol radio traffic?

163
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:58,838
每小时进行一次通信检查
Hourly comms checks.

164
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,606
一个请求需要更多的粮食
Plus, one request
for more ration packs,

165
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,208
还有两个关于无线电电池的请求
two for new radio batteries.

166
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,776
8个无聊的又饥饿的应征士兵
Eight bored
and hungry conscripts

167
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,678
他们的无线电已经被我们接入
whose radios we're dialed into.

168
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,181
没有低估他们的可能性吧？
No chance of
underestimating them then?

169
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,317
没有
Fair point.

170
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,153
我们再来回顾一遍你用来掩护的故事
Let's go over your cover story

171
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:16,189
最后一次
one last time.

172
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:22,228
爆炸之后，
After the bombing,

173
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,131
Nazir的网络中有人在Langley附近留了车
Nazir's network left a car
near Langley,

174
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,800
我开车进入森林，到达了加拿大边境
which I took into the woods
on the Canadian border,

175
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:30,136
在那里，我把头剃了，继续步行
where I shaved my head,
and I continued on foot.

176
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,138
然后我偷了一只船穿过芬迪湾，
There I stole a boat
across the Bay Of Fundy

177
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
到达新斯科舍，在那里，我遇见了一个
to Nova Scotia,
where I met a guy

178
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:35,975
与Amer El-Maati有关系的人
who had ties with Amer El-Maati,

179
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,411
他把我装进集装箱中送往哥伦比亚
who put me in a shipping
container to Colombia.

180
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:39,478
嗯
Mm-hmm.

181
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,247
然后，为(黎巴嫩)真主党工作的雇佣兵
Then, mercenaries
working with Hezbollah

182
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,749
将我带到了委内瑞拉，在那里，我最后被放进
took me across to Venezuela,
where they finally put me

183
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,318
一架国家石油公司的飞机上，
into a state oil company plane

184
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,485
飞到了伊朗
to a strip in Iraq,

185
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,821
我被交给了基地组织，
where I was handed over
to an Al Qaeda cell

186
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:52,124
然后他们带我穿过边境来到了伊朗
who were tasked with getting me
across the border to Iran.

187
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:57,396
加入基地组织，看看这个世界
Join Al Qaeda, see the world.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,101
最后一个检查，夜晚的视野
Final checks. Night vision.

189
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,807
夜晚视野传送进来了
Night vision transmissions
coming online.

190
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,232
我的口香糖吃完了
I'm out of Black Jack.

191
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,268
你那里还有吗？
Any more out there?

192
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,540
一切都还好吧，sir？
Everything okay, sir?

193
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:42,875
最后一个了？
This the last pack?

194
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:44,443
我还有很多呢
I got you plenty more.

195
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,445
别担心
Don't worry.

196
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,857
你写过信吗？
Did you write a letter?

197
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,593
什么？
What?

198
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,228
写给家里
Home.

199
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,563
说声再见
To say good-bye.

200
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,002
如果我做过，你们肯定都知道
Pretty sure you guys
would know if I did.

201
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:12,071
你可以把这事安排给你的CIA朋友
You could've arranged it

202
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:16,075
就是那个金发碧眼的
with your, uh, CIA friend,
the blonde.

203
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:30,923
你怎么样？
How you doing?

204
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,458
很好，你呢？
Good. You?

205
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,594
好像我正在维加斯用(房屋)抵押赌博
Feel like I'm in Vegas
betting the mortgage.

206
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,596
大家准备好了
Stand by, people.

207
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,098
好戏考试了
Show time.

208
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
Reaper1出什么事了？
What's going on with Reaper 1?

209
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,703
传感器带宽问题
Sensor bandwidth issues.

210
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,404
时常发生。我们正在重新设置
It happens.
We're resetting.

211
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:50,810
不过几分钟，一切都会好的
All being well, shouldn't
be more than a couple minutes.

212
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,044
一切都会好的？
"All being well"?

213
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,279
我们要压住队伍停滞不前，
Are we holding the team back

214
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,714
直到无人机重新恢复吗？
until the drone's back on line?

215
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:55,815
那个无人机主要是为我们工作
That drone's mainly for us.

216
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,149
他们有卫星电话和夜视
They have satphones
and night vision.

217
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,619
没有它(无人机)，他们现在能够向边境靠近的
They can move closer to the
border without it for now.

218
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,886
- *
- 什么？
- Shit.
- What?

219
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:43,055
去边境的路基本上是堵了
Road to the border's
as good as blocked.

220
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:47,092
外地的汽油卡车正在用免费的汽油贿赂当地官员
Foreign gas trucks paying off
local officials with free gas.

221
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:50,296
警察，军队，不管你怎么叫他们，全都在受贿
Cops, military, you name it,
all on the take.

222
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:53,432
边境在哪里？
Where's the border?

223
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:55,301
就在同一条路上，过了他们的1英里处
Another mile past 'em
on this same road.

224
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:57,570
那些远处的灯光
Those lights in the distance.

225
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:02,942
Zero,Kilo-Alpha，完毕
Zero, Kilo-Alpha, over.

226
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:04,076
Zero发送完毕
Zero send, over.

227
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:05,644
你看到我正在看的东西了吗？
See what I'm seeing?

228
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:08,380
是的，等他们结束
Yeah. Wait out.

229
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,618
伙计们，出来
Guys, get out.

230
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,155
搞得让那些路过的人看起来像是车坏了
Make it look like car trouble
for anybody passing.

231
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,663
我们是有一个备用计划吧？
We have a backup plan, right?

232
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:28,667
是的，我们正在等Langley确认替代路线
Yeah. We're waiting for Langley
to confirm the alternate route.

233
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:32,938
我需要雄蜂(无人驾驶机)。好了还是没有？
Now, I need that drone.
Are we gonna have it or not?

234
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,573
收到
Copy that.

235
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,883
怎么这么长时间？
What's taking them so long?

236
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:47,453
我不知道。他们遇到了无人机技术故障
I don't know. They had
a technical with the drone.

237
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:51,056
我们要在这里坐多久
So how long are we gonna
sit here for?

238
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,559
你比我的孩子们还遭
Shit, man,
you're worse than my kids.

239
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,295
那些后方指挥所的混账东西
God, those rear echelon
motherfuckers.

240
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:58,297
无人机出问题了
Got a problem with the drone.

241
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,766
真是个好的开始
That's a good start.

242
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:04,136
Reaper恢复正常
Reaper's back.

243
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:06,539
好的
Good.

244
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,807
现在我们来看一下
Now let's get eyes

245
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:11,043
进入边境的替代路线
on that alternate
route into the border.

246
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,912
正在重新定位
Repositioning now.

247
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:14,313
Kilo-Alpha，Zero
Kilo-Alpha, Zero.

248
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:16,382
无人机恢复正常，正在探测路线
Drone is back online.
Scouting your route.

249
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,584
等着
Wait out.

250
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:23,322
又嚼起你的幸运口香糖了？
Back to chewing
your lucky gum again?

251
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,558
是的，你也来一个？
Yeah. You want a stick?

252
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:44,677
*
Shit.

253
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,284
头低下
Put your head down.

254
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,687
假装睡觉，别动
Like you're sleeping.
Don't move.

255
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,762
Zero,Kilo-Bravo。准备好了
Zero, Kilo-Bravo. Stand by.

256
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:05,531
Alpha的车好像出了点问题
May have a situation
with the Alpha vehicle.

257
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,600
当地警察出现了
Local cops just rolled up.

258
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,243
马格利布（北非的一地区）
Maghreb.

259
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,213
你们问什么在这里？
Why are you here?

260
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,783
正要去Marivan
Going to Marivan.

261
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:40,065
基地组织
...Al Qaeda.

262
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:43,335
他们对掩护的故事不买账
They're not
buying the cover story.

263
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,708
天哪，他们想看一下卡车
Jesus, they want to look
in the truck.

264
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,515
说那句话，Kilo-Alpha
Say the word,
Kilo-Alpha.

265
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:59,084
- 什么话？
- What word?
- “晚安”
- "Good night."

266
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:02,821
他们应该在警察看到Brody之前说声“晚安”
They should say "Good night"
before the cops see Brody.

267
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,833
(穆斯林问候)
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

268
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,670
晚...安
Good... night.

269
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,898
嗨...
Hey...

270
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,400
你还好吧？
You okay?

271
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:25,604
Brody?你还好吗？
Brody? You good?

272
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:33,278
嗨
Hey.

273
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,260
- 你干什么？
- What the fuck are you doing?
- 我做不了这个
- I can't do it.

274
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,695
- 可以，你可以的
- Yes, you can.
- 我不行，不行
- I can't. No.

275
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,563
- 我不行，不，我不行
- I can't. No, I fucking can't.
- 你会的
- And you will.

276
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,532
我不行。我...
I fucking can't. I fucking...

277
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,034
现在说这些晚了(直译实在太过直接，还是大家意会一下)
Bit late in the day
for your vagina to chime in.

278
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,036
滚
Fuck off...

279
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:03,041
你害怕了？
You scared?

280
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:05,277
你是不是害怕了？
Are you fucking scared?

281
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,380
嗯
Mm-hmm. Mmm. I'm...

282
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:10,916
- 我怕了。我怕了
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- 好的
- Good.

283
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,585
我也是。我看到过太多的人
Me, too. I've seen
way too many men

284
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:15,220
在这个肮脏的第三世界被杀害
killed out here in this
third world toilet.

285
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:17,723
就我个人而言，每次他们派我回到这里我都很不爽
I personally shit myself every
time they send me back here.

286
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:20,259
如果你现在不走(指继续任务)
And if you don't snap out
of this right now

287
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,227
我们今晚都可能死在这里
we could all fucking die
here tonight.

288
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:24,129
这就是你想要的？
Is that what you want?

289
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:26,064
不
No.

290
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,734
告诉我你准备好了
Tell me you're gonna be okay.

291
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:32,437
告诉我这不是你的末路
Tell me that this is not
the end of the road for you.

292
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:38,677
- 不不不...
- No, no, no...
- 我需要听见你说
- I need to hear you say it.

293
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,779
我会...
I'll be...

294
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:43,615
我会好的.我准备好了
I will be okay. I'm okay.

295
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:46,018
我没事了
I'm okay.

296
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
我没事了
I'll be okay.

297
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:58,831
Kilo-Alpha，发生什么事了吗？
Kilo-Alpha, is there a problem?

298
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,670
Brody晕车了，他吐了
Passenger got carsick.
He threw up

299
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:06,138
现在我们准备好了
and we're ready to roll.

300
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,539
晕车？
Carsick?

301
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,608
这是安全卫星链路。你能告诉他们
It's a secure sat link.
Can you tell them to just

302
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,177
- 停止废话么？
- cut the bullshit?
- 他没事吧？
- Is he gonna be okay?

303
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,680
他没事的
Fuckin'-A he's gonna be okay.

304
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:19,451
给
Here.

305
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,119
擦掉你脸上的血
Wipe the blood off your face.

306
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,988
Kilo-Alpha
Kilo-Alpha,

307
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,191
kilo-Bravo，继续前进至替代路线的交叉点
Kilo-Bravo, proceed
to alternate crossing point.

308
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,193
知道了
Roger.

309
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,895
Alpha完毕
Alpha out.

310
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:43,242
我们刚才是不是杀了三个伊朗的警察官？
Did we or did we not just kill
three Iraqi police officers?

311
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,410
不要再小事上斤斤计较
Kurdish-- not to split hairs.

312
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:49,882
不管怎样，这并不是总统需要知道的
Either way, this isn't something
the President needs to know.

313
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,150
哦，我懂了，相信我
Oh, I understand.
Believe me.

314
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,988
帮我接JSOC(联合特种作战司令部)司令官
Get me JSOC Commander now.

315
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:25,550
这整个地区基本上就是无人区
This whole area is
pretty much a no-man's land

316
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:27,686
从伊朗伊拉克战争之后
since the Iran-Iraq war.

317
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,588
有人来了
We got visitors.

318
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,700
- 议员，将军
- Senator. General.
- 指挥官
- Director.

319
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:43,101
- 白宫...
- The White House...
- 我知道
- I know.

320
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,903
- 我被告知你会来
- I was told you were coming.
- 让我讲完
- Let me finish.

321
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,939
白宫派Pfister将军和我
The White House sent
General Pfister and me

322
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:48,307
过来观察和指导
to advise and observe.

323
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,909
指导，观察
Advise and observe.

324
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:54,046
JSOC司令官来指导；我自己...
The JSOC Commander, to advise;
myself, the President's nomin...

325
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,948
Higgins告诉了你们关于行动的哪些事情？
What did Higgins tell you
about the operation?

326
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,819
这次行动打算迅速，悄无声息，不留血迹的结束
That this part was meant to be
quick and silent and bloodless.

327
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,554
他告诉了你一切，不是吗？
He told you everything,
didn't he?

328
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:03,989
是的，他说了一切
Yes, he did.

329
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:06,558
- 包括...？
- Including...?
- 中士Brody，是的
- Sergeant Brody, yes.

330
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:08,927
Saul...
Saul...

331
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,829
不管怎样，
whatever this turns out to be,

332
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:13,231
是天才之举还是其它什么
bold stroke of genius
or otherwise,

333
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,334
我注定要继承这一切
I'm destined to inherit it.

334
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,235
所以既然已经在行动中了
So now that it's actually
in motion,

335
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:18,904
不管好坏
for better or for worse,

336
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:22,541
我没有选择，只能希望它能成功了
I have no choice
but to wish it every success.

337
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:28,347
单独说几句可以吗，议员？
A word in private, Senator?

338
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,082
不好意思，Bill
Excuse us, Bill.

339
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,216
当然
Of course.

340
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:44,930
你答应给我的喘息空间呢？
What about the breathing room
you agreed to give me?

341
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:47,966
交易时我推迟上任听证会
The deal was that I delay
my confirmation hearing,

342
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:48,934
这个我已经做到了
which I've done.

343
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:50,936
那个义务已经被履行了
That obligation
has been fulfilled.

344
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:53,305
祝你好运吧，Saul
Consider yourself lucky, Saul,

345
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:55,874
是Higgins打给我们电话，而不是总统
that Higgins called us
and not the President

346
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:59,011
或者他的国家安全顾问
or his National
Security Advisor.

347
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,117
明白了
Copy that.

348
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,085
明白
Copy.

349
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:11,189
- Mathison小姐
- Ms. Mathison.
- 议员
- Senator.

350
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:13,525
你的肩膀怎么样？
How's your shoulder?

351
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,395
医生告诉我你非常幸运
Doctor told me you
were very lucky.

352
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:18,797
我很好，谢谢你的关心
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

353
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,368
我能说的就是你肯定是一个极好的营销员
All I can say is you must be
one hell of a salesperson

354
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,203
才能让Brody做这件事情
to get Brody to do this.

355
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:29,608
在局里，我们都叫这个是招募
Here at the Agency,
we call that recruiting.

356
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:41,787
这里，看一下
Here. Take a look.

357
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,323
距离边境还有一半的路
Border's a click
and a half away.

358
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,659
过了那个房子300码
300 yards past that building.

359
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:50,829
只不过是一个浅溪，12码宽
All it is is a shallow stream,
12 yards across.

360
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:53,565
听着...我马上开车带你过去
Listen... I'm gonna
drive you right up to it

361
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:54,933
然后我们都会看着你
and we're all gonna
be watching you.

362
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:59,671
你穿过那条河，然后径直走向另一边的林木线
You way across that river and you head
up to that treeline on the other side.

363
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:01,840
你一到那里，朝北往回走3英里
Once you hit it, follow
it north for three miles

364
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:03,008
到达伊朗检查点
back to the Iranian checkpoint

365
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,243
就是我们起初要把你放下的位置
where we were
originally gonna drop you.

366
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:10,215
嗨，你去哪？
Hey, where you going?

367
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,683
撒尿
Piss.

368
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,919
跟他一起去
Go with him.

369
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:18,356
我们发现两个可能的敌人
We got potential bogeys.

370
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,025
两个伊朗军队的的悍马
Two Iraqi army hummers

371
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:22,561
三次出现在我们信号的南边
three clicks south
of our call sign.

372
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:25,397
Kilo-Alpha，南边出现两辆伊朗的悍马
Kilo-Alpha, we have
two Iraqi hummers

373
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,935
不是什么太重要的事情，但是注意了
three clicks south, it's not a
significant threat but be aware.

374
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:31,536
Alpha知道了
Alpha Roger.

375
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:34,372
好的，我们得知伊朗巡逻队3次出现在南边
All right, we got an Iraqi
patrol three clicks south.

376
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:37,542
不是什么大事，但是地势困难
It's not that big a deal but
it's difficult terrain out there

377
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,044
所以我们得行动迅速，安静
so we got to move quick, quiet

378
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:41,880
而且动静小，也就是说只有我和他出去
and small now, which means
it's just me and him from here.

379
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:44,583
你们剩下的人待在这儿，利用这里做掩护
Rest of you guys stay here,
cover from this position.

380
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:46,284
有问题吗？
Questions?

381
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,957
准备好了吗？
Ready?

382
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:54,793
是的
Yeah.

383
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,012
当你还是一个小孩的时候，你当时想长大后当什么？
When you were a little kid,
what did you want to be when you grew up?

384
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:17,249
我不记得了
I don't remember.

385
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:18,350
胡说
Bullshit.

386
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:20,318
每个人都会记得的
Everyone remembers.

387
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,025
你不用在管我了
You don't
have to manage me anymore, man.

388
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,027
我知道我来这里是做什么的
I know what I'm here to do.

389
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,997
只是和你聊聊
Just making conversation's all.

390
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:35,000
那是什么？
What's that?

391
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,436
不是什么？
Nothing.

392
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,215
那你想当什么呢？
Well, what did you want to be?

393
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:51,683
我在得克萨斯长大
I grew up in Texas.

394
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:54,019
我想做的就是骑牛
All I wanted to do
was ride bulls.

395
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:55,687
那你为什么没有？
Yeah, why didn't you?

396
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:56,821
我骑了
I did.

397
00:24:56,823 --> 00:24:58,790
2年
Two years.

398
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,792
但是我的粉丝受不了打击
But my nuts couldn't
take the beating.

399
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:05,497
所以现在我做这个
So now I do this.

400
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,665
真欢乐...
Happy fucking...

401
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:25,217
刚才发生了什么？
What just happened?

402
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:28,954
Kilo-Alpha,我是Zero，请回话
Kilo-Alpha,
this is Zero, over.

403
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,893
Kilo-Alpha,我是Zero，请回话
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero, over.

404
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,430
Kilo-Alpha,我是Zero，请回话
Kilo-Alpha, Zero, over.

405
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,001
Zero,我是Kilo-Bravo
Zero, this is Kilo-Bravo.

406
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,603
Alpha碰到了什么
Alpha hit something.

407
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,438
一个地雷或者是简易爆炸装置
A mine or an IED.

408
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,175
屏幕上能看见敌人吗？
Any hostiles on your screens?

409
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:51,810
准备检查
Stand by. Checking now.

410
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,314
目前而言，没有什么
Nothing, so far.

411
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,359
Sir，那个伊拉克巡逻队
Sir, that Iraqi patrol

412
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,461
刚刚转向北边，朝着爆炸的地点过来
just turned north,
towards the explosion.

413
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:13,698
现在我们必须告诉总统
Now we have to call
the President.

414
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,934
等一下。让尘土先落下来
Wait.
Let the dust settle first.

415
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,036
不，任何造成国际事件的可能性
No, any possibility of
an international incident

416
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:20,572
- 我都必须告诉总统？
- I must call the President.
- 你必须做得是
- What you must do

417
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,040
保持冷静的头脑
is keep a cool head

418
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:24,042
而且不要慌张
and take great care
not to panic.

419
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:26,244
好吧，我至少得通知伊拉克人
Well, we at least have
to call the Iraqis.

420
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:27,412
说什么？
And say what?

421
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:29,447
让你的巡逻队掉头，我们有一个CIA队伍
Turn your patrol around,
we have a CIA team

422
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,783
之前没有告诉你们，在那片地方执行任务？
we didn't tell you about,
operating in the area?

423
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:40,058
那个无人机是有武器装备的，对吧？
That drone is armed, correct?

424
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,059
Zero，我是Kilo-Bravo
Zero, Kilo-Bravo.

425
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,128
我们马上到Kilo-Alpha
We're one click out
from Kilo-Alpha.

426
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,263
知道了，kilo-Bravo，多加小心
Roger, Kilo-Bravo, be advised

427
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:47,932
伊拉克巡逻队正则逼近你们的位置
that Iraqi patrol is closing
on your position.

428
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:51,970
Sir，白宫打电话过来了
Sir, White House
is on the line.

429
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:55,407
放到屏幕上
Put him on the screen.

430
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,941
Mike
Mike.

431
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:59,444
- 我可能有一个解决方案
- I may have a solution.
- 请说
- Please.

432
00:26:59,446 --> 00:27:03,081
那个无人机装备有4颗导弹
That drone has four
Hellfire missiles on it.

433
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,283
你是说我们与伊拉克巡逻队交战？
You saying we engage
the Iraqi patrol?

434
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:08,353
我是说我们刚才发现了基地组织
I'm saying we just found
an Al Qaeda cell

435
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:11,856
正在视图偷运美国头号恐怖分子到伊朗
trying to smuggle America's most
wanted terrorist into Iran

436
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:14,125
我们用无人机干掉了他们
and we take them out
with that drone.

437
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:14,993
天哪
Jesus.

438
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:17,429
如果他们死了，这就是一个很聪明的局
It's a smart play
if they're dead.

439
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:23,201‘
- 那如果他们没死呢？他根本不在乎他们是死是活
- And if they're not dead? - He doesn't
care whether they're dead or alive,

440
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:26,338
他所在乎的就是收拾自己的烂摊子
all he fucking gives a shit
about is covering his own ass.

441
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,606
- 闭上你的嘴，Carrie，嘴闭严
- Bite your lip, Carrie. Bite it hard.
- *
- Fuck.

442
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:33,511
那个伊朗可巡逻队赶过来还得分钟？
That Iraqi patrol is,
what, a minute away?

443
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:37,349
让我说的清楚点，Mike
Let me be very clear, Mike.

444
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:42,354
我绝不会下令对我们自己人的攻击
I will not order
a strike on our own men.

445
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,191
挂断
Hang it up.

446
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:51,196
我们发现Alpha汽车里面有动静
We've got movement
in the Alpha vehicle.

447
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:21,426
要不就是汽车刚刚静下来
Either the vehicle just settled

448
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:23,928
要不就是我发现第二个热信号在移动
or I have a second
heat signature moving.

449
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:34,038
第二个人在移动
The second figure is moving.

450
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,574
他们活着，他们都活着
They're alive;
they're both alive.

451
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,193
我的腿
My leg.

452
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:57,262
***
Motherfucker...

453
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:00,465
不
No.

454
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,902
- 我的腿...
- My fucking leg...
- 好的，坐起来
- All right, sit up.

455
00:29:03,904 --> 00:29:06,538
坐起来，坐起来
Sit up, sit up.

456
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,906
双臂合十
Fold your arms.

457
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,742
好的，跟我来
Okay, come with me.

458
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:12,944
好的...
All right...

459
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,320
电话，卫星电话...
Phone, satphone.

460
00:29:27,827 --> 00:29:30,495
- Kilo-Bravo,我是Alpha，请回答
- Kilo-Bravo, this is Alpha, over.
- 我是Bravo，说
- Bravo, send.

461
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:33,465
我们在边境西边的一个房子中
We're in the building
to the west of the border,

462
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,733
没有敌人的火力，受伤人员任然有意识
no enemy fire;
casualty is still conscious

463
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:37,735
他是他失去了一条腿，并且大量流血
but he's lost a leg
and a lot of blood, over.

464
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:40,438
Bravo，知道了，60秒后到达你的位置
Bravo, Roger.
Your location 60 seconds, over.

465
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,841
发现一个持枪小队在高地上
Get a gun team
up on high ground.

466
00:29:42,843 --> 00:29:46,277
我暂时可以解决休克问题，阻止流血
I can treat for shock
and stem the blood flow for now.

467
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,448
别着急，按照我们的路线进来
Take your time to follow
our exact route in, over.

468
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,484
明白了
On it. Out.

469
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,268
想你的孩子们
Focus on your kids.

470
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,470
笨蛋，我没有孩子
I don't have any kids, dumbass.

471
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:16,875
随便谈一谈，因为你当时就是个小孩子
Making small talk 'cause
you were being a fucking baby.

472
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,513
我们一定会把你带出去
We're gonna get you out of here.

473
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:36,961
抽烟
Smoke.

474
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,631
给我一些烟
Here, give me some
of my cigarettes.

475
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,012
我从来没想过我会是现在这个家伙
I never thought I'd
be this fucking guy.

476
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:56,214
我也没有
No, me neither.

477
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:02,053
我猜是我完蛋了
I guess I fucked up, T.

478
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:04,322
Beers on you, then.

479
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:05,690
我给他打了一针吗啡
I gave him one morphine shot.

480
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:06,691
他就剩一个了
He's got one left.

481
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,026
我们得马上走
We got to haul ass now.

482
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:10,495
抓住那个
Grab that.

483
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,668
这这这...
Here. Here... here.

484
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,170
翻过去
Roll... back.

485
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,505
好的
Okay.

486
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,208
- 准备好了吗？
- Ready to do this, boss?
- 是的
- Yeah.

487
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,045
好的，大家都回到卡车上去
All right, everybody
back to the truck.

488
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,613
- 走！
- Go!
- 我们走，快
- Let's go, quick.

489
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:36,154
伊拉斯巡逻队来了
Iraqi patrol
just joined the party.

490
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,636
Zero,我是Kilo-Bravo，联系！从南边发起了机械攻击
Zero, Kilo-Bravo, contact!
Automatic fire from the south.

491
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:53,304
一个排或者是一个连的火力
Platoon or possible
company strength.

492
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:01,579
尽全力不要将这个扩大化
Do all you can
not to escalate this.

493
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:04,248
压制回击火力，只能压制火力
Suppressive return fire.
Suppressive fire only.

494
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,584
别让他们在地面上，让他们转过去
Don't put them in the ground.
Just turn them around.

495
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:09,921
Zero，我是Kilo-Bravo，我们
Zero, Kilo-Bravo,
we don't get Aziz out

496
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:12,657
- 在几分钟内不能把Aziz带出来了，他死了
- in the next few minutes, he's dead.
- 伊拉克的信号正在
- Iraqi call signs

497
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,126
请求炮兵火力攻击
are requesting an artillery fire
mission up the chain.

498
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,794
我们的直升机有多远？
How far out are
our helicopters?

499
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,997
8分钟
Eight minutes.

500
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,398
将军，有什么建议？
General, advice?

501
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,000
我们没有8分钟了
Eight minutes
is time we don't have.

502
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:24,569
- 要不然我们打电话给伊拉克，和和他们说实话
- Either we call the Iraqis and level with
them... 
- 我们也没有这个时间
- Also time we don't have

503
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:26,270
我们负担不起任何一次反攻
and every shade of blowback
we can't afford.

504
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:29,240
所以这就是要撤退到一个安全的登录区
So it's a fighting withdrawal
to a secure LZ,

505
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:32,143
就是后退远离他们刚才离开的那辆车
back five clicks in the vehicle
that they have left.

506
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,850
换句话说，我们得放弃任务
In other words,
we have to abort.

507
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,090
情报行动结束了
The intelligence
operation is over.

508
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:48,292
现在是军事行动，全靠你了，将军
It's a military one now.
It's all yours, General.

509
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:49,594
谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

510
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:50,928
向那些人开枪吧
Shoot the boys out of there.

511
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,430
知道了
Copy that. Comms.

512
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,842
Kilo-Bravo,我只Zero-Alpha
Kilo Bravo, this is Zero-Alpha.

513
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:06,344
Bravo，请说
Bravo, send.

514
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:09,447
- 我们将要用导弹来把他们打回去
- We're going to push them back
with Hellfire, over. 
- 明白了
- Roger.

515
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:12,016
由你下令，在导弹的掩护下撤退
Withdraw with Hellfire
in support on your command.

516
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:13,618
我来下令，好的，等一下
On my command, roger, wait.

517
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,554
他们要放弃任务吗？
Are they aborting the mission?

518
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:22,293
Saul
Saul.

519
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:26,698
你运气不太好
You had some bad luck.

520
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,299
对不起
I'm sorry.

521
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:34,772
嗨
Hey.

522
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:36,874
至少我们还有Javadi
At least we have Javadi.

523
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,711
他还在咱们的局中，不是什么都没有
He's still in play.
That's not nothing.

524
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:42,547
是的
Yeah.

525
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,004
准备导弹任务
Stand by for Hellfire
mission, over.

526
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:08,005
你们准备好了吗？
You guys ready?

527
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:12,110
后退！后退！
Fall back! Fall back!

528
00:34:12,112 --> 00:34:15,680
- 我不会回去的
- I'm not gonna go back.
- 你***在说什么？
- What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, you are.

529
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:18,015
我要闯过边境到伊朗，你是不能阻止我的
I'm gonna walk across that border into
Iran and you're not gonna to stop...

530
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:21,385
听我说，我现在在命令你后退
Listen to me! I am fucking ordering
you to fucking move out!

531
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:27,358
Brody拒绝撤退
Passenger refuses to withdraw,

532
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,861
我没有时间了，请指示
and I'm out of time.
Please advise.

533
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:32,029
不要留下任何人
Do not leave anyone behind.

534
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:33,598
我们在密集的火力下
We are under heavy fire!

535
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
伤员是第一位
The casualty is priority one,

536
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:37,435
Brody**不听话！
and the passenger is
non-fucking-compliant!

537
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,708
将军，请指示！
General, please advise!

538
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,543
让我跟他说
Let me talk to him.

539
00:34:45,545 --> 00:34:48,312
如果有人能说服Brody撤退的话，一定是她
If anyone can talk Brody
down off a ledge, she can.

540
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,316
好的
All right.

541
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,421
让Brody接电话
Put the passenger on the line.

542
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:00,158
我再说一遍，让Brody接电话
I say again,
put the passenger on the line.

543
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
拿着
Take this.

544
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:05,329
拿着
Take it!

545
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,231
Brody？
Brody?

546
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,566
Brody？
Brody?

547
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:11,235
Brody，你能听见我吗？
Brody, can you hear me?

548
00:35:11,237 --> 00:35:15,072
- 嗨，Brody！
- Hey, Brody!
- 他们正在放弃计划，Carrie！
- They're trying
to abort the mission, Carrie!

549
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:18,075
- 我知道
- I know.
- 好的，告诉他们***
- Well, tell them to go fuck themselves.

550
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,243
不，听我说
No, listen to me.

551
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:21,579
你自己一个人完成不了
You can't do this by yourself.

552
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:23,748
我距离边境就只剩300码了，Carrie
I'm 300 yards
from the border, Carrie.

553
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,583
我能做到的
I can make it.

554
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:28,119
你现在进入伊朗边境，你将完全只能看你自己了
You cross into Iran now and you will
be completely on your own.

555
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,688
说实话，我觉得这里也没有什么选择了
Well, to be honest I don't see
much of an option here.

556
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,757
选择就是撤退，再重新组织
The option is
to fall back, regroup,

557
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,792
我们之后会再找机会的
and we'll take another shot
at this later.

558
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:38,196
得了吧,Carrie，你知道这不会发生的
Come on, Carrie, you know
that's not gonna happen.

559
00:35:38,198 --> 00:35:40,998
你不知道！
You don't know that!

560
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
停下来想一想
Now, stop and think
this through.

561
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:45,336
你没有地面支援
You have no sanction,
no support on the ground,

562
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,538
没有撤退计划
and no extraction plan.

563
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:52,109
你会死在那边的
You will die over there!

564
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:53,611
不，你错了，Carrie
No, you're wrong, Carrie.

565
00:35:55,215 --> 00:35:57,281
你想知道为什么吗？
And you want to know why?

566
00:35:57,283 --> 00:35:58,683
因为你能把我弄回去的
'Cause you're gonna get me home.

567
00:35:58,685 --> 00:36:00,952
别这样说！别跟我说这个！
No, don't say that!
Do not put that on me.

568
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,119
这是个幻想
It's a fantasy.

569
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,321
你会有办法的
You'll find a way.

570
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,022
我有信心
I have faith.

571
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:06,457
就这样
That's all. Out.

572
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:07,892
不！Brody！Brody！
No, Brody! Brody!

573
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,466
*！
Fuck!

574
00:36:15,468 --> 00:36:17,235
我们现在要撤退了
We are fucking moving out now.

575
00:36:17,237 --> 00:36:18,336
所有人，走！
All of us. Let's go.

576
00:36:18,338 --> 00:36:20,471
我不走
Not me.

577
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,674
他走了！***！
He's gone! Fuck him!

578
00:36:56,676 --> 00:36:59,076
导弹袭击，快！
Hellfire, now! Hellfire, now!

579
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:02,079
导弹袭击，快！
Hellfire firing now.

580
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,154
走，走！
Move. Move now!

581
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,723
抓住他！
Grab him!

582
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:20,865
- 拿着
- Take it.
- 你要干什么？
- What are you doing?

583
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:23,734
把他带到着陆区，然后再来接我，走！
Get him to the LZ,
then come get me. Go!

584
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:25,770
*！
Fuck!

585
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:38,883
**的狙击手
Fucking snipers.

586
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:41,652
永远都固执的***
Always the stubborn
fucking assholes.

587
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:46,090
我能为你争取30秒时间来穿过边境
I can buy you 30 seconds
to cross that border

588
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,391
到达树林
and get to those trees.

589
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:48,726
我一旦开枪，你就跑
Once I start firing,
you start running.

590
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,895
如果你停了，我就亲手射杀你
And if you stop,
I'll fucking shoot you myself.

591
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:52,730
有问题吗？
Any questions?

592
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:54,465
- 没有
- No.
- 很好
- Oh, good.

593
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:56,300
数到三
Count of three.

594
00:37:56,302 --> 00:37:59,136
1...2...3!
One... two... three!

595
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:10,614
那是什么？
What is that?

596
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:11,816
他们被包围了
They're surrounded.

597
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:12,917
被谁包围了？
Who by?

598
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,819
我们是不是遗漏了无线信号中的东西？
Are we picking up
anything on radios?

599
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:19,557
...Nicholas Brody
...Nicholas Brody.

600
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:25,464
_

601
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:27,260
_

602
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,847
_

603
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,311
_

604
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,303
_

605
00:38:37,304 --> 00:38:39,011
_

606
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:39,920
_

607
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,091
_

608
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:02,066
伊朗人说他们有两个囚犯
The Iranians are saying
they have two prisoners.

609
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:04,368
确定是伊朗人而不是伊拉克人？
Are we sure it's the Iranians
and not the Iraqis?

610
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,470
100%确定
100%.

611
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:08,739
上帝
Jesus.

612
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:30,995
他们把伤员安全转移出
They got the
casualty out safely.

613
00:39:30,997 --> 00:39:34,765
他现在很稳定
He's stable, on a bird
out to the carrier group now.

614
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:40,438
还有一些事情
There's something else.

615
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,640
什么？
What?

616
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:47,078
Brody成功越过边境
Brody made it across.

617
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:51,582
怎么做到的？
How?

618
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,250
他最后又跑了一次
He made a last second
run for it--

619
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:55,986
直接跑到了伊朗军事单位
headfirst
into an Iranian military unit.

620
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:59,190
他还好吧？
He's okay?

621
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:01,292
是的
Yes.

622
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:11,368
他成功了
He made it.

623
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,603
还有你，Saul
And you, Saul,

624
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,406
仍然在这场游戏中
are still in the game.

625
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:18,375
我糟透了
I'll be damned.

626
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:32,790
现在，这些家伙...
Right now, these guys...

627
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:35,493
他们被训练得对待任何越境的人
uh, they're trained
to treat anybody coming

628
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:37,695
都认为是以色列的特工
over the border
as Israeli agents.

629
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,367
你被折磨过...
You were tortured...

630
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:48,072
所以，告诉我接下来会发生什么
so tell me what to expect.

631
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,244
被击垮
Expect to break.

632
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:05,389
你当时维持了多长时间？
How long did you hold out?

633
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,326
我不知道
I don't know.

634
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:11,529
我当时根本没有时间概念
I lost track of time
pretty much right away,

635
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,531
但是，我想...
but I figure...

636
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,966
7天吧？
seven days?

637
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:17,268
足够让那些人
Enough time to allow the guys

638
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,905
改变他们的频率和作战计划了
to change their frequencies
and battle plans.

639
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,109
我只是...
I just...

640
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:27,111
我只是希望我能给你7天时间
I just hope
I can give you seven days

641
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:29,280
在德黑兰把事情搞定
to get the job done in Tehran.

642
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:31,282
嗯？
Huh?

643
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,076
嗨
Hi.

644
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:00,144
我能...？
May I?

645
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:02,146
当然可以
Of course.

646
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:09,153
Fara，你是这栋大楼里极少
Fara, you're one of the few
people in this building

647
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:11,722
知道Majid Javadi是局里的线人的人
who knows that Majid Javadi's
an Agency asset.

648
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:13,057
我不会告诉任何人的
I didn't breathe
a word to anybody.

649
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,227
我知道你不会，但这不是我来这里的原因
I know you didn't--
that's not why I'm here.

650
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:19,196
但是你在招募Javadi过程中扮演了非常重要的角色
But you had a crucial role
in recruiting Javadi.

651
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:22,333
事实上，Saul说过，没有你，这事就不可能成功
In fact, Saul says, without you,
it never would've come off.

652
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,335
他夸张了
He's exaggerating.

653
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:26,003
不过谢谢你
But thank you.

654
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:30,007
事情是这样的...
The thing is...

655
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:32,776
Javadi只是这个局的一半
Javadi's only half the play.

656
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:34,445
行动还有一个阶段
There's another phase
of the operation

657
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:35,613
你之前不知道的
you weren't made aware of.

658
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:38,349
这牵扯到一个线人，他的生命
It involves an asset,
whose life depends

659
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:41,085
取决于我们是否能在关键的时刻把他从伊朗解救出来
on us getting him out of Iran
at the critical moment.

660
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:43,287
事实是我们的营救计划
And the fact is
our extraction plan

661
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,522
刚才灰飞烟灭了
just went up in smoke.

662
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:47,858
对不起
I'm sorry.

663
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,862
Fara，你在得黑兰有一个叔叔
Fara, you have
an uncle in Tehran.

664
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:54,031
你爸爸的兄弟
Your father's brother.

665
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:55,966
- Carrie，不
- Carrie, no.
- 听我说完
- Just hear me out.

666
00:42:55,968 --> 00:42:57,901
不，这太危险了
No, it's too dangerous.

667
00:42:57,903 --> 00:42:59,536
- 我们所需要的就是...
- All we're asking for...
- 你在要求我
- You're asking me

668
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:01,038
将我的家人置于非常危险的境地
to put my family
at extreme risk.

669
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,307
你知道你是这样的
You know you are.

670
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:05,042
你忘了我直接目睹了
You forget I've seen firsthand

671
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:08,145
一场行动是多么快的失败了
how fast an operation
can go sideways.

672
00:43:09,714 --> 00:43:11,882
告诉你事实
Tell the truth.

673
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,785
你永远不会要求你的家人这么做的
You would never ask your
own family to do this.

674
00:43:14,787 --> 00:43:17,588
我也许会
I might.

675
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,090
从我对你叔叔的了解来看，他不是
And from what I know about
your uncle, he's not one

676
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:22,159
一个在大街上穿梭来避免麻烦的人
to cross the street to stay
out of trouble's way.

677
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:24,728
他是温和反对派的成员
He's a member of a moderate
opposition group.

678
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,430
不是扔炸弹的人
Not a bomb thrower.

679
00:43:26,432 --> 00:43:28,666
我们所需要的就是城市里的一个地方来碰头
All we need is a place
to meet in the city.

680
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:30,467
一个实际上的安全屋
A de facto safe house.

681
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:37,841
Fara，我们有一个特工兄弟就在前线
Fara, we have a brother agent
in the field,

682
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:41,011
即将面临致命的危险
soon to be in mortal danger.

683
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:44,348
难道我们要欠他一个生还的机会吗？
Don't we owe him every chance
to get out alive?

684
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,333
嗨
Hey.

685
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:15,913
有人来了，有人来了
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

686
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,836
我的名字是Nicholas Brody...
My name is Nicholas Brody...

687
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:40,971
我正式向伊朗伊斯兰共和国
and I'm formally seeking asylum

688
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:44,742
寻求政治避难
in the islamic Republic of Iran.

689
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:46,577
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

690
00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:50,748
Ayman Jassim.
Ayman Jassim.

691
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,995
准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

692
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,064
准备好什么？
Ready for what?

693
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:09,266
跟我去得黑兰
To go with me to Tehran.

694
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:15,672
那他呢
What about him?

695
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:18,208
