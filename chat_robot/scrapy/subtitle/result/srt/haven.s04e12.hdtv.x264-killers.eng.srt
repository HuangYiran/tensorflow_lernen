1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously onHaven...</i>
(unstake my heart)

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,100
That's not just some cheesy paperback. It's something more.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,800
"In times of great evil, the child of ruin must find the heart of Haven and summon the door. "

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,000
- What's a child of ruin? 
- I think it's me.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
That's why William wants you dead.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,100
- Because I can summon the door. 
- William... he knows everything about her.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,800
He knows where she comes from. They have this connection.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
I don't know if I know how to protect her anymore.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,900
William kept saying that we're connected,

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,200
that he and I are responsible for The Troubles.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
They're here because of us, because of me.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
- Have you told Nathan? 
- No.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Great game.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,600
- What's that awful sound? 
- I don't hear it.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,900
- Do you hear that?
- What?

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,900
Perimeter's all clear, Nathan.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,500
You got to admit, this place is easy to defend.

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,000
- We can see anyone coming. 
- That's exactly why I use this place... I mean, for business.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
But mostly as a space of, like, reflection and solitude.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,100
Stan, remember, if you see William, you do not shoot.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,500
Copy, all due respect, boss, for, like, the 16th time.

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:37,300
- I'm reminding myself too. 
- I don't think that William's coming.

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,800
I think that maybe because Jennifer has that book, he can't hurt her.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
The book is a book like the barn was a barn.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,300
It's some of otherworldly instruction manual that 

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,700
Jennifer and only Jennifer can use to summon the door between two worlds.

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,000
I think that book exists to deal with William.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,600
That's why his rougarou died when he touched it.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,400
That book is showing us how to get rid of him.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,800
So we find the door between the two worlds, and we shove him right through.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,100
And lock the bastard out for good.

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,400
Well, that explains why William wants you dead.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm gonna have to start cang you Obi-Wan.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,000
- You're our only hope. 
- Duke's right.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,100
You're the only one that we can banish William from this world.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,200
But I think now that he knows that you have that book,

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
he's gonna try to step up his plan.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Okay.

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,200
So step one... find the heart of Haven.

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,400
Anyone? Yeah, we never heard of it.

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Great.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,100
messages(3):suspicious death

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,000
- Three dead bodies. 
- It's got to be William.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,100
You find that door, we won't have to deal with this much longer.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
Are you sure the book's not telling you anything else?

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,400
I think it only reveals instructions one at a time.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
Right now all it says is,

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
"find the heart of Haven," and I turn the page,

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,300
and it's just the guard symbol that sort of fades in and out.

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
Fading in and out.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,800
I know somebody with a guard tattoo
that does the exact same thing.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Three victims spread around town,

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
all died within a minute of each other, around 10:15.

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Older man, a younger man, a younger woman...

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,300
all unrelated.

56
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,400
There's got to be some kind of connection.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
I'll go chop 'em up and see.

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
- Thanks. 
- Yeah, no problem.

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,000
Same as the car-wash girl... both victims seemed to hear something right before they died.

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Some kind of death-whisper Trouble.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Maybe. But three bodies at one time, that's a lot.

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,000
- William. 
- Yeah, it has to be.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
No, I mean, William.

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,200
Hi, there.

65
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,800
You son of a bitch.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,700
You feeling better? I healed us as fast as I could.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
You did this. You killed those people.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Well, I don't want to brag, but sort of, and it's just the beginning.

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,100
Bodis are gonna start stacking up like cordwood.

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,600
That's a confession. Put your hands behind your back.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,300
Arrest me, and people will keep on dying.

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,300
No? Good.

73
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
You need my help to solve this Trouble.

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,300
Follow me, alone, and I'll show you how.

75
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,100
Parker, hey.

76
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,700
Nathan, what's he gonna do... hurt me?

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
He's killed three people already.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,100
We need to figure out how he's doing this.

82
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,300
The cabot journal was right.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
A soft spot between worlds was torn apart by that door.

84
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,800
We have to put William and all the evil that he brought with him back on the other side.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
- What is the heart of Haven?
- We don't know.

86
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,600
But in the book, Jennifer is seeing a guard symbol that fades in and out, just like I've seen yours do.

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,500
Oh what?

88
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,200
My symbol... it's been acting strangely.

89
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Normally, I control it, but it's begun fading in and out on its own.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,800
- You never told me that. 
- You didn't tell me you ate the last of the marmalade last night.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,500
That's not the same thing, Vincent!

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Gentlemen, the tattoo?

93
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,300
You're doing it together.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,100
The symbols are glowing in sync with each other.

95
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,200
It's signaling you.

96
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
But I have no idea why.

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,800
So Audrey Parker thinks I'm evil.

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,900
Well, she's just a shell. And I want to free you from that prison.

99
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,500
Just tell me how to stop this Trouble that you caused.

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,600
That I caused? That's charming.

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,700
You caused it. I just tweaked it.

102
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,600
It was always your favorite, 'cause it was just so darn deadly.

103
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,600
- I don't believe you. 
- No?

104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Well, here's the plan for today...

105
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,300
I'm gonna introduce you to a Troubled person.

106
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
You're gonna see that the usual "Audrey Parker tricks" don't work, 

107
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,700
and then... here's the best part...

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,900
you're gonna have to give someone a new Trouble to fix things.

109
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
You want me to give someone a Trouble?

110
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, it'll be like sleeping in your own bed again,

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and I'm betting, when you do, you're gonna remember who you are.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,100
How does me giving someone a Trouble fix the one that's already killing people?

113
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,700
Well, we used to set up complementary Troubles

114
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,100
to see how they'd interact... fire and ice, that sort of thing.

115
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Jordan caused pain, and Nathan can't feel her.

116
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:51,200
And this one is a sound Trouble, so you're gonna have to make...

117
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
a silence one.

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Bam. She's a natural.

119
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,000
I will never give a Trouble to solve a Trouble.

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300
I'll find another way.

121
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,700
No you won't.

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
No.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
You didn't.

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,600
- What a beautiful baby. 
- Thanks.

125
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Cry.

126
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
- Is she okay? 
- Oh, my gosh.

127
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Die.

128
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,400
You were always such a clever Troublemaker.

129
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,200
Before the incident today, when did your boy last cry?

130
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,300
Around 10:15. He was hungry.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Okay, Ben, listen, I know that this is gonna be hard to hear.

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,100
Aaron has it... the harker family curse.

133
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,800
It's not supposed to start before puberty, but somehow he... he got my Trouble.

134
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,100
I thought William made this Trouble.

135
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,700
No, he just... he triggered it in the baby.

136
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,700
"Never let a harker cry, lest near or far people die. "

137
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,900
So harkers don't cry.

138
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,600
Generation after generation, we teach our children not to cry.

139
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
I Haven't cried since I was 11.

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,700
But Aaron is four months old.

141
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
How do I get my boy not to cry?

142
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, where is your baby now?

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,700
With his mother, breast-feeding.

144
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, listen, I need you to tell me

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,900
everything you can about this Trouble.

146
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,700
We cry, people die, near or far.

147
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,100
What more is there?

148
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,700
There's got to be more, all right?

149
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,600
I need you to think. We can't just teach your kid not to cry.

150
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,700
We need to have some other kind of option.

151
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,100
My great Uncle had down syndrome.

152
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,100
They couldn't teach him not to cry before puberty.

153
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,400
All right, so what'd they do?

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
- Come on, Ben. 
- They cut his vocal cords.

155
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Is that the kind of solution you're looking for here?

156
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,600
- No, it's not. 
- I'm sorry.

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,900
I need to see my boy.

158
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,600
- Listen... 
- Hey, we need to talk.

159
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey, we need to finish questioning Ben.

160
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,500
What is going on?

161
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,800
What did William say to you?

162
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,000
Whatever it is, we can deal with it together.

163
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,300
Maybe not this time.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,500
Maybe you won't... you won't want to.

165
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,500
Talk to me, Parker.

166
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
For so long, I've wanted to know who I am... me...

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,700
Before Audrey, before Lucy, before Sarah.

168
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,300
And then William comes along, and he has some answers.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,700
And who I am... Is a woman who used to love him.

170
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
You're not that person anymore.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
- You have me now. 
- I don't deserve you.

172
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,000
He says that I started The Troubles, Nathan.

173
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,800
All those years ago, I used to love William,

174
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,300
and he and I created The Troubles together.

175
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,600
We would give them to people together... yours, everyone's.

176
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
And now he wants me to do it again.

177
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,000
William told me that the only way to help the baby

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,700
is by creating some kind of Trouble

179
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,300
that'll stop his cries from killing people.

180
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,700
And if I do that... He says if I give someone a Trouble,

181
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,900
then I will remember who I am.

182
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,500
You are Audrey Parker.

183
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,900
You don't give people Troubles.

184
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,500
You save them.

185
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,900
The first born in my family always had this mark,

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,700
going all the way back to the founding of Haven, and more.

187
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
The Teagues have mi'kmaq blood.

188
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,800
You call it a tattoo, but really it's a birthmark and a birthright.

189
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,600
It designates me to be protector of Troubled people.

190
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,900
- That's why you're the leader of the guard. 
- That's my sacred duty.

191
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,300
Okay, but your symbol blinks in rhythm with this book

192
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,000
- like you're supposed to show us the heart of Haven,and you have no idea? 
- No.

193
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,100
<i>- Unless... What if I'm the heart of Haven? 
- Oh, please.</i>

194
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,700
Does your egotism know no bounds?

195
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Hang on.

196
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
It's not a bad question.

197
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,800
Jennifer?

198
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,200
If he was, I think I'd have a new set of instructions by now,

199
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,700
but... No luck.

200
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,400
So what kind of birthmark does the second born get?

201
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,600
Oh... I have no Teagues blood.

202
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,700
Like you, I was adopted.

203
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, that explains a lot.

204
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,500
All right, so the woman at the park was about 50 feet from the baby.

205
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,900
But the tennis player was six Miles away.

206
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,800
Other victims spread around, near or far.

207
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,900
The more information we get, the more random it looks.

208
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,200
There has to be a pattern. We just Haven't seen it yet.

209
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,100
There isn't. Believe me. Oh, Benny.

210
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
God, Benny, I'm sorry.

211
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,500
- Hi, mom.
- Oh, you're Ben's mom?

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,200
Stepmom. I was married to Ben sr. For 20 years, God rest his soul.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,600
Gloria raised me, and she's been an amazing grandma to Aaron.

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
So you know about the harker family curse?

215
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,900
You think marriage is tough until you fall for a guy

216
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,000
who can't allow himself to cry.

217
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,600
It brings new meaning to "emotionally unavailable. "

218
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,600
How can you be so sure there's no pattern? There's got to be some way to stop this.

219
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh, I've been here before. I tried to figure this out.

220
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I didn't want to have to teach Ben to never cry.

221
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,600
- So you researched the harker family Trouble? 
- Yeah, we laid into the history.

222
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,900
We went back as far as we could.

223
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,000
We worked nights, weekends for years to find a way.

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,700
- It's a dead end.
- Every Trouble has rules, some connection.

225
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,500
- There... there has got to be some sort of logic.
- The logic on this one is brutal.

226
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Victims die randomly and in droves.

227
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,300
It hasn't been this ugly since 1901.

228
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,800
Hundreds... hundreds of people died in Haven and the surrounding counties.

229
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,900
<i>The old herald had to run a bogus story on Spanish influenza.</i>

230
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,200
Okay, but it stopped. Somebody stopped it.

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,800
Yeah. I'll give you one guess how.

232
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,900
They killed a Troubled person.

233
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,800
You show me somebody who has the heart to murder a baby,

234
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
and they're gonna have to go through me first

235
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,100
So you know what? Just like, rev up your Trouble-solving machine or whatever she is,

236
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,900
and just find a way to save my grandson!

237
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,200
William says that you need to give someone a silence Trouble tneuto ize the baby's deadly cries,

238
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
but, no, Gloria's right.

239
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
You are a Trouble solver.

240
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,200
You're immune.

241
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,700
So what happens if I hold the baby the next time he cries?

242
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Exactly.

243
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,300
He does that when he's tired.

244
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,800
He usually cries right before he falls asleep.

245
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,700
It's okay, Aaron. You don't have to cry.

246
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
You're gonna be safe.

247
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,800
Ashley? Ashley?

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,400
Oh, my God, Ashley.

249
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,900
My wife is gone, and I can't cry.

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,100
Tell me what to do.

251
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,300
I need something to do.

252
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,900
You stay strong for your son.

253
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Well, it, uh, looks like her heart just stopped...

254
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,700
Similar to the others.

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,400
The baby's cries killed two people...
(1 warehouse employee found dead.148 main st)

256
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,300
his mother and some guy in a warehouse across town.

257
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,000
Listen, Gloria, just let us get somebody to cover for you.

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
There's no time for that. I'll do it.

259
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,700
There's too much to take care of.

260
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm here to take care of you.

261
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

262
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,500
In the good ear, love.

263
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm afraid we're gonna lose him.

264
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,400
I know. I know, I know, I know.

265
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Lincoln... Gloria's worse half.

266
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,400
Nice to meet you.

267
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,300
I think the baby could use some grandpa Lincoln time, okay?

268
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,600
Yeah, all right, honey.

269
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,700
- So he knows about the... 
- The Troubles?

270
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,900
Hard to live with Gloria doing what she does and not know.

271
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,100
To think I lived in Haven for 60 years

272
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,000
before I discovered its secret. I'll go sit with Ben,

273
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
I love you. Thanks.

274
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Ben thinks we have about an hour and a half till the baby wakes up.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
<i>All right, listen, I'm gonna go down to theherald.</i>

276
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm gonna take a fresh look at the archives

277
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,800
and see if there's some kind of pattern that you may have missed, Gloria.

278
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,200
Maybe with the new d. O.A., we can find some sort of connection.

279
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,800
Well, you got about 90 minutes to prove me wrong, and I hope you guys do,

280
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,400
or we're gonna have another plague like 1901 on our hands.

281
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,900
We will figure this out. I'm gonna check out the d. O.A. At the warehouse.

282
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Hey, Duke.

283
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Hey. What do we got?

284
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,700
Huh? I've always wanted to say that.

285
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,500
You think killing innocent people is funny?

286
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,900
Oh, I'm not the murderer here.

287
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,500
Now, I know he looks cute and all, but if you ask me,

288
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,600
I think the baby did it.

289
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,100
I was actually hoping I'd bump into your partner here, but you can take her the message.

290
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,200
This all stops when she makes the right decision.

291
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,900
The right decision? You're out of your mind.

292
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
And you're out of your league.

293
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
You have no idea about the larger picture.

294
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
It...

295
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,100
it's like trying to explain physics to a goldfish.

296
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,600
Now, you can do whatever you want with Audrey Parker.

297
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,400
Go steady, take her to the prom.

298
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,500
I want the original.

299
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,400
She only is... And always will be Audrey Parker.

300
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,600
And yet, when you shot me, she bled.

301
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,600
That's a level of intimacy you can't comprehend.

302
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,700
You don't know the first thing about love.

303
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,100
When I break your connection to Audrey,

304
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm gonna put you in the ground, and it will hurt.

305
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Hurt like this or like this?

306
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,400
Aw, you feel me just like you feel her.

307
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,300
That's all you can do.

308
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,900
You can throw punches, but you can't turn Audrey into something she's not.

309
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,700
Clearly she thinks I can, or she wouldn't be stalling.

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
A Troubled baby whose cries kill people? That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,700
- Yeah. 
- Hey, go help Audrey.

312
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,500
- I'm not leaving you here alone.
-  Alone?

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,900
Half of the Haven p. D. Is outside, there's a getaway boat on the dock,

314
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,700
and I have the, uh, badasses of checkers as well.

315
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
Look, I just don't know about this.

316
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Plus, I have this.

317
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,100
I'll be fine. Go help Audrey.

318
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,000
We will look for the door here however we can.

319
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,100
And then maybe tomorrow we can just have a quiet brunch,do the crossword.

320
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,700
If you think that we are gonna be

321
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,800
like some flavored-coffee commercial, you clearly don't know me.

322
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
I know you, Duke.

323
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,600
- All right. 
- Okay.

324
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,100
unreal for victim of spanish influenza held this past sunday

325
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,300
That's me.

326
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,200
So what's so important that you couldn't tell me about it on the phone?

327
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,100
Gloria's right. It's completely random.

328
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,300
I can't stop the harker curse. I never could.

329
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,200
I faced it before, and I failed.

330
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Now, in about 25 minutes, that baby wakes up, starts killing people.

331
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,100
All right, so the going theory is that William's giving out Troubles

332
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,000
because he thinks the original Audrey liked it.

333
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,500
And he wants you to remember her.

334
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,500
If that's true, does that mean that you and William...

335
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,500
Did you make The Troubles in the first place?

336
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Yes.

337
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,600
And now he wants me to do it again.

338
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,900
He wants me to create a silence Trouble

339
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,100
that will stop these deaths and save the baby.

340
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
So you called me down here to grant you permission

341
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,500
to give someone a Trouble?

342
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,500
Audrey, you can never do that, no matter what happens.

343
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,500
He is trying to get you to shove that needle back into your vein.

344
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,400
There's no recovering from that.

345
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
You don't trust me to hold on to who I am

346
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
I don't trust The Troubles.

347
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,400
They are deep and dark, and they take the people you love away.

348
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
No one's taking Audrey away.

349
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Do it.

350
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,400
Trouble whoever you need to to make this stop.

351
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
I know you're strong enough.

352
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,500
You're not gonna turn into whoever William wants you to.

353
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
I believe in you, Audrey,

354
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,100
but if you turn back into some female version of William...

355
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,000
If that happens, forget The Troubles,

356
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,500
forget babies that kill people.

357
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,800
We are screwed on a whole other level.

358
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,200
I knew you'd come find me here.

359
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
It's our place.

360
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,800
So you ready to give someone a Trouble?

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,900
No.

362
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I've decided to kill the baby.

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
That's not what I was expecting.

364
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,300
You're bluffing.

365
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay.

366
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,000
You want to see what I'll do? Let me be plain.

367
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,100
The harker clan is large.

368
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Baby Aaron has eight cousins under the age of ten.

369
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
If you kill that baby...

370
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,300
I'll activate each and every last one of them.

371
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,200
And you would do it too.

372
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Because you're important and because I love you,

373
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,700
I have to corner you into making a Trouble.

374
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,400
All right... I'll do it.

375
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,000
You have no idea how happy this makes me.

376
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,400
- This isn't about you. 
- Oh, don't ruin the moment.

377
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,300
Just tell me what I need to do.

378
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,800
Giving someone a Trouble requires an alchemy of three things.

379
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,300
First, a strong intention. What kind of curse do you want?

380
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,900
And use your imagination.

381
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,700
Two, the person you choose is key.

382
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean, who are they? Are they a good match for your intention?

383
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,500
Now, the curse, or intention, is shaped in here.

384
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,600
You're giving them a release. It's a gift.

385
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,300
I'll never believe that.

386
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, you will.

387
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Finally...

388
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,700
There's this.

389
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,000
Think of this as the breath of life.

390
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,000
Put it in your hand, put your hand on a customer,

391
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,600
and wait for the party.

392
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Intention, person... And... Black ball of stuff.

393
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,700
This is gonna be amazing. I can't wait.

394
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,900
You're not invited.

395
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,200
How about a kiss for luck?

396
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,300
Come any closer, I'll punch you in the face.

397
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
It'll be worth my own black eye.

398
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,700
Intention, person, evil black goo...

399
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,500
you know, jacking up somebody's life shouldn't be this simple.

400
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,700
But it's not that simple.

401
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,400
Aaron's gonna wake up and cry at any minute, and I've got to come up with some kind of silence Trouble.

402
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,100
What's that mean, okay? What's my intention?

403
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,500
The d. O.A. At the warehouse, right before he died, he said he heard a baby cry.

404
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,000
That's five Miles away.

405
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,600
So the sound travels supernaturally. It's still just sound.

406
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,600
You want to give somebody, what, a "bubble of silence" curse,

407
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,900
and then stick the baby inside of it

408
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,300
so that the... the evil sound never leaves its throat?

409
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
A Troubled version of cutting his vocal cords.

410
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
But a lot less cruel.

411
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay, I wasn't really suggesting that.

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,200
Okay, but who do I Trouble? Help me think.

413
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,700
Troubles are always related to the people that have them.

414
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,200
Right, Jack Driscoll was a deep-sea diver.

415
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
He developed a crazy pressure Trouble.

416
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,500
What?

417
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,600
Well, you weren't exactly the most emotionally expressive kid in school.

418
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,300
Now you're numb.

419
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,300
- You're a sponge. 
- Wasn't derogatory.

420
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,800
Okay. Who can best manifest this bubble of silence?

421
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,900
Maybe somebody who's mute?

422
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,800
Yeah.

423
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,600
Or someone who can barely hear.

424
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,700
Are you out of your mind?

425
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,300
I definitely heard that in both ears, my dear.

426
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,900
Now, how about we let Audrey continue?

427
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,200
I don't want to hear another word.

428
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
She wants to ruin your life with a Trouble.

429
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,400
I don't want to do any of this.

430
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,000
It's just our only option left. I think you know that.

431
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,800
So, with my poor hearing, you think I'll have a Trouble that silences things, 

432
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
and can save little Aaron from killing people.

433
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,300
I understand all that,

434
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,900
but can you really give me a Trouble, brand-new, with the ribbon still on?

435
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,500
I think so.

436
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,300
I didn't think that was possible.

437
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,400
Neither did I till a couple days ago.

438
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,100
- King me. 
- A cheat deserves no crown.

439
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,000
King me.

440
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,200
Okay. I got next game.

441
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,600
Vincent.

442
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,500
Your birthmark.

443
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,500
Oh, my God.

444
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,400
Are you doing that?

445
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,400
I think it's the book.

446
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,100
It's moving like a compass, and the figure's the pointer.

447
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,500
It's always pointing in the same direction.

448
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,000
What's it pointing at?

449
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,700
The lighthouse.

450
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,200
Maybe the lighthouse is the heart of Haven.

451
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,800
You sure you're ready for this?

452
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,700
Yeah, I'm a tough, old goat. You'll never hurt me.

453
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,000
Okay.

454
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,300
How do you feel?

455
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,900
It feels strange.

456
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
It, uh, tingles.

457
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,900
Okay, well, I think it... it worked.

458
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
- What's that noise? 
- What?

459
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
My ears! Oh!

460
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,000
It didn't work! Everything's turned to noise!

461
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,700
Let's get the baby out of here.

462
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Something went wrong.

463
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,100
Okay. There was nothing I could do.

464
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,400
There was just too much noise. He cried a lot.

465
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,100
- What happened in there? 
- It's not your fault, Ben, okay?

466
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,600
It's mine. Here... Why don't you just, um, try to give him a bottle?

467
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,600
messages(5):suspicious death

468
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
Five more bodies.

469
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,000
Stay here.

470
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Please... Tell me your name.

471
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,800
Audrey Parker.

472
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,400
Damn. I-I-I really... Never mind.

473
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,600
We'll get through this. Um, what happened?

474
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,300
I did what you told me to do.

475
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,400
I gave a sweet, old man a Trouble, and it didn't work.

476
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,600
But you gave him a Trouble?

477
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,500
Yes.

478
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,200
Instead of eliminating sound, it made everything sound strange.

479
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,600
But it's pretty great.

480
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I mean, your first try, after all these years, you made a sound-related Trouble?

481
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,900
When you did it, did you feel anything?

482
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,900
I felt terrible. And I didn't help the baby.

483
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,800
Try again, and you will get it right.

484
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,200
Why are there six in here?

485
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,300
Troubles are more of an art than a science.

486
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,000
That's why we like them so much.

487
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,600
Look, that baby's almost done his bottle,

488
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,100
and I know Audrey Parker wants to help.

489
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,600
You're close, I promise. Keep going.

490
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,000
And when you're back, you're gonna kick yourself for not having more fun.

491
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,500
- Is Lincoln okay? 
- Give me the box.

492
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,700
I have to keep trying.

493
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,600
You know, I'm fine if you want to lie to that scumbag,

494
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,900
but you're not gonna lie to me.

495
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,100
Lie about what?

496
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,900
You felt her.

497
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,500
You felt your original self... And you liked it.

498
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,200
This is the heart of Haven.

499
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,900
There's been some kind of lighthouse here

500
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,100
as long as anyone can remember.

501
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,800
No stairs, no ladder... how do we get up?

502
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,400
Well, looks like we're out of luck, then.

503
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,800
- I think we should go down. 
- We're not out of luck, Dave.

504
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,300
You can hoist me up to that ledge there.

505
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,000
You know how hinky my back is.

506
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,700
Guys, seriously, why don't we go down the trap door?

507
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
What door?

508
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,800
You don't see the trap door?

509
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,900
No.

510
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,700
Then we definitely have to go down there.

511
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,200
I think going down there is a really bad idea.

512
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,100
Come on, Dave.

513
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Come on!

514
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,900
It was terrifying.

515
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,200
It was, like, the worst jolt of just evil when I touched him.

516
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,700
And I think that some deep part of me liked it.

517
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,300
Which is why you can't do this.

518
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,500
The temptation is too much. He will get you back.

519
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
You won't be Audrey Parker anymore, and you won't care.

520
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
But I do care.

521
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,400
I care about you.

522
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,400
I'm not gonna let you do this.

523
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,200
How do I justify what I did to Lincoln? I can't just give up.

524
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,100
We'll stick him in a soundproof room.

525
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,700
We'll... something. We will find another way.

526
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,300
All right, but I am not gonna hurt that baby.

527
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,200
No, you're not.

528
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,100
You're gonna hurt me.

529
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,900
I know about the Crocker curse. Kill me.

530
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,900
It's really dark down here.

531
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,900
- I... I think I have some matches. 
- I knew it.

532
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,200
You said you quit smoking five years ago.

533
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,900
Vincent.

534
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,400
- Holy jumping... 
- I think we have found the heart of Haven.

535
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
Four people.

536
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,800
To summon the door, we need four people... one for each spot.

537
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,100
- Okay, Ben, listen, that's really noble of you, but... 
- hang on.

538
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,400
Are you sure about that?

539
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,600
Am I sure I... Want to leave my son without any parents?

540
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,300
No.

541
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,800
But I don't know another way.

542
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,900
I'm sure she didn't tell you,

543
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,400
but Gloria considered the Crocker family curse a-a great blessing.

544
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,200
Why?

545
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,500
It cured her family of the Trouble.

546
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
One of your ancestors killed one of hers.

547
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
I want to take this Trouble to the grave.

548
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
All right.

549
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Take the baby up to the house. We'll meet you there.

550
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,900
Are you crazy?

551
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,700
You just told me that I shouldn't Trouble anyone else,

552
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,600
and now you want me to re-Trouble you,

553
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,800
give you the Crocker family curse so that you can kill that baby's father?

554
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,400
- No, we've been down that road before. 
- Hey, I don't like it either.

555
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,000
But he is volunteering... And so am I.

556
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,000
You can't go on troubling person after person until you get it right.

557
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,100
Body count's just keep climbing.

558
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
You know me.

559
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,900
You know my curse.

560
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,600
I mean, just... One more hand slap, and we're done.

561
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,500
I mean, it's... It's that, or you kill the baby.

562
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,900
No. No, Benny. No!

563
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,300
It's the only way.

564
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,100
No, it can't be.

565
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,600
All The Troubles you've solved in this town... This is your plan...

566
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,200
to strip me of my family one by one?

567
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,400
Listen, Gloria, it wasn't my idea.

568
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,900
Well, then think of something, okay?

569
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,100
Just think of something, something that won't make my grandson an orphan.

570
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
He'll have you.

571
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,900
That's not enough. He needs you.

572
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,300
You called the Crocker family curse a blessing

573
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,100
when it cured your family of their Trouble.

574
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,600
You know, I don't even know what it was.

575
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,900
I don't know either.

576
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,600
How great would it be if Aaron's kids didn't know about this curse?

577
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,100
You raised me as best you could, and I love you for it.

578
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:15,800
I need you to teach Aaron how to live and how to feel

579
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
and how to cry without fear.

580
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,400
We are so close to getting that door.

581
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,100
We find the right four people, we can put William away, and life becomes manageable.

582
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,800
That's still the plan, okay?

583
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,500
I- I have to get back up there and do this.

584
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,400
No, you have to explain this to me.

585
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,900
I understand that people are dying and there's a baby,

586
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,000
but why do you have to be the hero this time?

587
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,600
Because I'm not a wild card like Gloria's boyfriend,

588
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,300
because the Crocker you see is the Crocker you get

589
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,200
Yeah, exactly. The Crocker curse...

590
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
do you really want to go through all of that again?

591
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,100
I don't want to.

592
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,200
I have to.

593
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,000
I am gonna be fine and just as annoying as when you first met me.

594
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,700
This isn't funny, Duke.

595
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,100
None of this is funny. This is horrible.

596
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,300
And I'm horrible for feeling this way, but I don't care.

597
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,000
Jennifer, stop.

598
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,600
I know you're scared.

599
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,500
After this, you and me... we will still be okay.

600
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,100
No, I was with you when your brother died, after your brother died,

601
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,600
everything that you went through.

602
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:54,000
- Look... 
- no. No... we were supposed to have

603
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,700
our flavored-coffee commercial tomorrow

604
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,800
with all of this stuff behind us... William, that stupid door.

605
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,800
We still will.

606
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,500
And we'll make a toast to your family curse.

607
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,000
- Are we doing this?
- Yeah, we're doing this.

608
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:15,600
